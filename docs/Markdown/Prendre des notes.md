## Introduction to the Zettelkasten Method
[Introduction to the Zettelkasten Method](https://zettelkasten.de/introduction/)

Niklas Luhmann was a highly productive social scientist. He published 50 books and over 600 articles thanks to his Zettelkasten method.

> A Zettelkasten is a personal tool for thinking and writing. It has /hypertextual/ features to make /a web of thought/ possible. The difference to other systems is that you create a web of thoughts instead of notes of arbitrary size and form, and /emphasize connection, not a collection/.  

Luhmann’s Zettelkasten is a collection of notes on paper slips with a special twist: It is a hypertext that he could navigate the drawer cabinet containing all the paper slips with a reasonable amount of time and energy. 

We can improve ordinary note-taking methods in several ways:

1. *We can improve the connectivity of our thoughts.* The hyper-textual nature of the Zettelkasten enables us to connect ideas. These connections make new insights possible. Insights don’t happen in a vacuum. They are the result of making new ( [unexpected](https://plus.maths.org/content/information-surprise) ) connections.
2. *We can be more productive.* The Zettelkasten Method streamlines our workflow by giving clear guidelines on what to do. This, in turn, decreases friction. It is quite common to enter a stage of flow which further increases productivity. I even allocate two days per week to make Zettelkasten work my priority and  [allow Zettelkasten flow](https://zettelkasten.de/posts/practical-integration-deep-work/)  to happen.
3. *We stop wasting our efforts.* Even if you don’t use any of your notes for a project you’re working on at the moment, you prepare the knowledge for future projects. At the very least, you improve the depth of processing information from that topic.
4. *We can tackle more complex problems.* It is very difficult to keep all the balls in the air if you juggle complex problems. The Zettelkasten Method allows you to concentrate on a small part of the problem and after that take a step back and look at it with a panorama vision.
5. *Normal note-taking will create a bloated mess over time.* The Zettelkasten on the other hand will scale itself automatically to the size of the problem you are tackling. This is what Luhmann talked about when he wrote about “internal growth” (I translated it into “organic growth”) in  [his manual](https://luhmann.surge.sh/communicating-with-slip-boxes) .
6. *The Zettelkasten Method will make your writing easier, more coherent, smoother and more convincing.* One of the main problems in writing and thinking is our limited capacity to follow one line of thought for a long period of time. Just think of meditation. It is even difficult to focus on a simple thing like breathing for a couple of minutes. Imagine how difficult it is to think about one issue for weeks and months to write a thesis. The Zettelkasten will hold your thoughts alive and help you to hold onto them.

We have to make notes to wrestle with problems effectively. To put it  [in Luhmann’s words](https://luhmann.surge.sh/learning-how-to-read) :

> What are we to do with what we have written down? Certainly, at first, we will produce mostly garbage. But we have been educated to expect something useful from our activities and soon lose confidence if nothing useful seems to result. We should, therefore, reflect on whether and how we arrange our notes so that they are available for later access.  

### How does it work?

If you want to refer to an individual note, it needs to have *a fixed and unique address* by which you can identify the note. It is necessary to make the actual lookup possible. [...] When you deal with a bunch of paper notes, however, you need to make it possible and bearable to get anywhere at all. Luhmann’s approach was a clever numbering system.

The very first note is assigned the number 1. If you add a second note that is not related to the first note, it is assigned the number 2. But if you want to continue the first note, or inject something into its content, comment on it, or something along those lines, you branch off. That new note would get assigned the number 1a. If you continue with this new note, you would go on with 1b. If you then want to comment on the note 1a, you would create a note with the address 1a1. So, in short, whenever you continue a train of thought, you increment the last position in the address, be it number or a character from the alphabet. And when you want to expand, intersperse, or comment on a note, you take its address and append a new character. For this to work, you alternate numbers and characters.

Luhmann’s numbering system has two consequences for re-creating his method:
1. It makes organic growth possible. Luhmann didn’t use the term /hypertext/, but he probably would if he lived today. ::This organic growth is also precisely how wikis and their wiki-link feature works. You have a text but want to expand on a point. You /branch off/ from the current page, and thus basically inject another text into the current one, but at the same time hide its contents.::
2. It makes linking possible. The emphasis on linking is a more obvious hint at the hyper-textual nature of his Zettelkasten. The non-linear link structure is the main trait of a hypertext. In his manual on how to create a Zettelkasten,  [he wrote:](https://luhmann.surge.sh/communicating-with-slip-boxes)  It is not important where you place a new note as long as you can link to it.

[...]

At this stage, we have a surfable hypertext. But we do not have something like a search engine to enter the hypertext. “Where to start?” is a question Luhmann needed to answer. He used his register as the place to start, his entry point.

Luhmann’s register could be mistaken for a tag system. However, the individual notes were not tagged, nor did he put a tagging system in place to organise his Zettelkasten.

![](Photo%207%20Feb%202021%20at%20152339.jpg)

There are very few IDs per item in his register, sometimes just a single one, next to each term. His register is purely a list of entry points, not a tag list.

The fixed address of each note is the alpha and omega of the world of Zettelkasten. Everything becomes possible because of it.
