Dear Tim Cook,

Do I have to say that I do love your products? I have most of them. I have an iMac, several iPads, a MacBook Air, an iPhone and, at the time of this writing, an Apple Watch which is travelling all around the world.

I remember me discovering Apple and these lovely white machines when this century had almost 3 or 4 years. As a PC user, I immediately fell in love and bought, as a start, an iPod. Since then, I used to watch every single keynote and I trusted you when you said (actually _you_ weren't, Apple was) that education were in your DNA. I was really convinced that Apple could make a difference when it comes to education.

For instance, I did believe that iBooks author would be a revolution in the small world of publishing. That software made me buy an iPad. It wasn't only this beautiful piece of hardware, it was all about creation. I knew I could do great stuff. And I think I did. I wrote several textbooks and, as a trainer, I even went in San Francisco to show how I had created those books.

Yes. I *was* a trainer. An Apple Trainer. Of course I wasn't engaged by you. You only said after a day or two that I could be a part of the programm named Apple Professional Development. You put a label on me and some of your partner were calling me to do some training. When it all begun, I thought it would be great. I would see a lot of people, I could talk about what I love, I would be trained and initiated to the depths of your most complex software. I even thought (I laugh at loud as I write this) that we will get a machine for free in order to demonstrate how great they are. But you are so stingy that you won't even offer your trainer an app that cost 0,99$.

Anyway! As an Apple fan boy, I was ready to pay whatever I needed to. As long as I believed I could trust your implication in education, I would do what's necessary. Alas! Things begun to go wrong.

The app I used the most was becoming a kind of zombie. iBooks Author or the living dead... The only app that kept its old interface that no other software have anymore. The operating system, Keynote, Pages, Numbers, iMovie and so forth evolved (at a excessive slow pace though) but evolved. Of course, there is now some new templates in iBooks Author and I can export in ePub that no one except Apple can read. But who cares? Where are the new functionalities?

It is the same for iBooks. When I open it, I could think we're back in 2010. You were right about dropping skeumorphism but that's all you did. Have your ever read a book on a Kindle? If you do, you will see that you are no more less than a decade late. But the fact is you don't care anymore about books. And, as a teacher, I can't forgive that. I am so disappointed. Moreover, you kicked me out of iBooks about 4 or 5 times sometimes for no reason at all, but that's another story...

Nevertheless, I find some comfort in using iMovie or Garageband. But why the heck are you neglecting books? I can't understand. You did the same with iWeb (and for a glittering of other software) which makes me say that I can not involved myself in products that could have a very short life because of... Of what by the way? Decision made during an administration council?

As a matter of fact, all this didn't really affect my interest in Apple. I am still a happy user. And, as I said, I love your products. I'm pretty happy with my iPad Pro and my Pencil. However, I did not buy your smartcase with a keyboard. It is too obvious that you think your customers are cash cows.

So, naturally, we have some iPads in our school and guess what? I am the one who is responsible of these machines. Then I discovered the incredible ditch between using an iPad for your own use and deploy them in a school. To put it simply, it is a nightmare. However, I was aware of it. I was no expert but I knew what I was dealing with. In fact, I thought I knew. As we only have 14 iPads, I downloaded Apple Configurator 2, which is pretty simple to use.

And then I discovered the pure joy of logging to [https://appleid.apple.com](https://appleid.apple.com), to [https://idmsa.apple.com](https://idmsa.apple.com), to [https://vpp-fulfill.apple.com/vpp/welcome.html](https://vpp-fulfill.apple.com/vpp/welcome.html)... I started dreaming about MDM, VPP, Apple ID. What choice do I have to make? A code or a token? If I don't have any MDM, can I use Classroom? Why this guy when I call Apple support tells me one thing when this other one tells me another? Why don't I have any response? Why all my iPads can't be updated all together without getting a failure message? Troubles everywhere.

So, to end this too long letter, I am fed up with all of this. Last day, a friend of mine expressed is happiness about Google administration in one web page! In ONE WEB PAGE! How many Chromebooks will I have for 14 iPads that you can't administrate without pulling out you hair?

I don't expect an answer but I needed to say all that. I needed to say how badly Apple is missing her educational purposes, how deceiving how all that is. Even Microsoft starts to be more attractive than you are. Word or Onenote have found a way onto my iPad. I have a ton of Google apps. Software are the trojan horse of your own machines.

With all my respect,

Yann Houry
