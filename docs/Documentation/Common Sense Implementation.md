### Plan
setting goals
-   What are the primary needs of and challenges for students? What about parents and caregivers? Teachers and staff?
-   How will you find out? What is your main motivator? (use of the iPad on a daily basis)
- How can [Common Sense recognition](https://www.commonsense.org/education/recognition) be a motivator and road map?
- Who are your key stakeholders? (Example: faculty, staff, counselors, parents, students.)
-   How will you get key stakeholders engaged in digital citizenship? How will you listen to and address the needs, objections, and ideas of key stakeholders?
-   Who will need to be involved in planning? Who is part of your digital citizenship team?

All our students are equipped with an iPad. They all have a Google Workspace for education account. While this is great to foster collaboration, creativity and productivity, we are aware that digital devices can create distraction amongst other things. We do believe that students not only need to learn the three Rs (reading, writing and arithmetic), they also need to be proficient communicators, creators, critical thinkers and collaborators (the “Four Cs”). Learning how to use technology is therefore of paramount importance. But we need to implement these skills within our curriculum.

We do believe that creating a digital citizenship is of paramount importance. see screenshot above.
We also want to engage families with tips and activities. Genius bar.

We want students to take ownership, to be more responsible and “exhibit empathetic behaviour online that build relationships and community”

Civic learning, communicate with civility

Promote critical thinking to better understand fake news, identify credible sources, recognise differente perspectives & cultural contexts (diversity week)

Have curiosity and practice empathy

It’s also great to find good resources easy and fun to use
