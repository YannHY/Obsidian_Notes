## Why are students often struggling to make strong arguments?
**Problem**: arguments are spread through the text. They are difficult to understand because ==prose is linear and arguments are not==. Therefore, argumentation is daunting to secondary school and college students.

**Solution**: [Endoxa](https://endoxalearning.com/) solves this problem by using diagrams called *argument graphs* to represent arguments.

The above screenshot compares a 6-page document to the argument graph.

Using the argument graph, students can ==visualise arguments, analyse and better understand the structure of the argument==. The argument graph summarises the whole text and displays the argument steps from the premises to the conclusion. Arguments are joined by an argument type box which shows what kind of reasoning is being used...

Visualising the argument makes it quicker and easier to understand than reading a 6-page text.

It helps students learn how to build a strong argument. They can, for instance, add their own arguments and submit them to the teacher. They can also make their own argument from scratch to use as visual essay plans or as a revision guide.

In fact, it's a great way to assess students' thinking by looking at their argument graph first then by asking them to write an essay.

## You Turn
Now, visit [Endoxa Learning](https://app.endoxalearning.com/), pick a subject (for instance Geography Year 7-9), then a topic (let's say Weather and climate). Finally, pick a lesson (Is the UK vulnerable to extreme weather events?)

You will notice that green lessons are free. Purple lessons require a subscription.
