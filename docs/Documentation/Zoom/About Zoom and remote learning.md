You are now **teaching online** and I have good reasons to think that you are **using Zoom**. So, today, I would like to share with you some of the things I have found while browsing on the web.

## Zoom for Teachers Tutorial

I was doing some research and I ended up on YouTube watching this video [ZOOM for Teachers Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHd4Cff4Ha8). Nothing new but the **tips** shared by the host are interesting and important. You probably already know all of them but they are worth remembering it. For example, the tutorial explains how to engage your audience by **talking to people and looking at people**. Not your screen. It means you have to look at the camera. Makes sense? It’s a little bit strange but effective.

## Multiple Sharing

It occurred to me (thanks, Gerard) that you could **ask all participants to share their screen at the same time**. It’s a wonderful feature that would be tremendously helpful but we can not (unless I missed something) use it on mobile devices. I asked for it in a possible [future release](https://zoom.us/feed). Fingers crossed. I recommend you do the same by the way. The more people are asking, the better.

## IPEVO

I also read [11 Benefits To Enhance Your Remote Teaching](https://www.teachertoolkit.co.uk/2020/12/09/ipevo/) . I’m very interested in IPEVO, a **multi-angle arm for smartphones** you can buy on [Amazon](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Multi-Angle-Smartphones-Multi-Jointed-Communication-Presentations/dp/B08JPZ94Y8) for £59. It’s a little bit expensive but useful: you can show documents but you can also use the arm to use the camera of your phone to display your face on Zoom. The camera of your iPad is quite good (but too low). The camera of your Mac, if you use one, is terrible. Avoid that one!

Anyway, the arm is interesting. In the aforementioned article, you can watch how to use it with [IPEVO](https://www.ipevo.com/software/idoccam/pricing) ‘s software. Again, it’s pretty expensive but definitely interesting.

However, you can also transform your iPhone into a **document viewer** with [Overview](https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/overviewer/id1528900395). I found this app by reading [Overviewer turns your iPhone into a document camera for Zoom calls | iMore](https://www.imore.com/overviewer-turns-your-iphone-document-camera-zoom-calls?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+TheIphoneBlog+%28iMore%29). It’s free and may be useful if you want to share a paperback or any document of the “real” world.  [The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/6/22217200/overviewer-app-teachers-overhead-camera-iphone-zoom) is also mentioning the app.

But if you just want an adjustable Cell Phone Holder, consider [this cheaper alternative](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Abetcabe-Adjustable-Compatible-Samsung-Silver/dp/B08PKJ3DTT) (£15.99). Or [this one](https://www.amazon.co.uk/HORUMP-Height-Adjustable-Holder-Compatible/dp/B08BY9MWMP) (£8.99).

And, of course,  there are plenty of [Zoom hacks to join a session using a second device as a document camera/visualiser](https://twitter.com/joedale/status/1241299751590604801?s=21). 😄

## Get rid of this annoying noise

Sorry! But [this article](https://www.macg.co/logiciels/2021/01/unclack-coupe-le-microphone-pendant-la-frappe-au-clavier-118893) is in French but all you have to know is that, if you use a Mac, you can download [this free software](https://unclack.app/#/) “that **mutes your microphone while you type**. No more getting called out for clacking your way through a Zoom meeting on your clicky keyboard!”.

## Backgrounds

Last but not least, backgrounds.

![](wired.jpg)

You probably use one to hide whatever you want to hide. Remember? [You can download any image you want to use as a background](https://link.medium.com/02uZN7rQ0cb).

If you can’t use virtual background because your computer is too old and doesn’t meet the system requirements, you still have the possibility to use this [cheap background for Zoom](https://twitter.com/NikkiDRobertson/status/1259935589064945668?s=20).

But you don’t have to choose between showing yourself and your presentation. Did you know you could **display your PowerPoint presentation in the background**?

On your computer, simply go to `Share Screen`  > `Advanced` > `Slides as Virtual Background`.
