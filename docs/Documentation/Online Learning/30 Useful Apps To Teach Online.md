During the pandemic, schools closed and a lot of teachers tried to recreate the classroom environment thanks to a bunch of applications (and a good bandwidth as well).

True, everyone hopes going back to school, but we know that the ‚Äúnew normal‚Äù will probably be hybrid teaching, which means some students will be physically present in class and others will be attending online.

In this article, you will find 30 applications that will make your life much easier if you have to embrace hybrid or online teaching. There is everything you need to kick off this new challenging academic year.

## 1. Videoconferencing
Using video conference platforms for teaching online is a pretty obvious choice.

- [Zoom](https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/zoom-cloud-meetings/id546505307)
- [Google Meet](https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/google-meet/id1013231476)

Zoom is much more powerful than Meet but [Google plans to bring major updates](https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/education/new-meet-features-for-edu/) throughout the year to come.

### üí° Tip
Have you considered recording your session so that students will be able to return to the day‚Äôs lesson in order to review it at their own pace? Of course, everyone has to agree before you do that.

- [G Suite Learning Center](https://support.google.com/a/users/answer/9282720?hl=en)

## 2. Whiteboard
You may use the Zoom built-in whiteboard, the powerful [Notability](https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/notability/id360593530) or [JamBoard](https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/jamboard/id1143591418) apps or even [GeoGebra Notes](https://geogebra.org/notes).

Whatever your choice will be, in Zoom, go to: `Share Content` > `Whiteboard` or `Screen` (if you prefer Notability or JamBoard).

But consider those free alternatives. They really worth it!

- [WhiteBoard.fi](https://whiteboard.fi/)
- [CryptPad](https://cryptpad.fr)

### üí° Tip

## 3. Deliver content
Whether you want to communicate important announcements to students or deliver documents & assignments or you want students to submit their work, Google Classroom is the best option but a lot of teachers love to create their own website thanks to Google Site. Some others use Padlet to deliver their courses in a very simple and elegant way that does not require any code or password. For very young students, it‚Äôs really convenient.

- [Google Classroom](https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/google-classroom/id924620788)
- [Google Site](https://sites.google.com/)
- [Padlet](https://padlet.com/)

### üí° Tip
Want an easy way to make attendance? In Classroom, ask a simple question (like ‚ÄúAre you there? If yes tick the box.‚Äù üôãüèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è)

## 4. Give feedback
### On a Google Docs

### On a PDF
You may prefer using PDF files you can annotate in [Kami](https://www.kamiapp.com/) for instance.

### üí° Tip
Why writing a long answer to a student‚Äôs question when you can record it in a lively and dynamic video? Use [Loom](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/loom-for-chrome/liecbddmkiiihnedobmlmillhodjkdmb) to do that. And you know what? Loom is free if you are an educator.

## 6. Foster collaboration between your students
Being online, respecting social distances doesn‚Äôt mean students have to work alone or separately. There are many ways to make your students work collaboratively and help each other. They may also want to talk to you even if you work from home. Please consider these few options.

1. Of course, you may have a one-to-one videoconference (be aware of safeguarding issues).
2. You can use [Loom](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/loom-for-chrome/liecbddmkiiihnedobmlmillhodjkdmb) to record feedback.
3. Students can (and should) write comments in Google Classroom if they don‚Äôt understand something.
4. You can create some kind of forum so a question (and, of course, your answer) benefits to the entire class. [Google Groups](https://groups.google.com/) is great for that.
5. Get a backchannel with [Yoteach](https://yoteachapp.com/).
6. Create your own social media just for your class thanks to [Qwiqr](https://eu.qwiqr.education/).
