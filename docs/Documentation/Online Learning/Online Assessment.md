## Assess online students’ work
You need to accurately assess students’ learning working from home. Using some tools and a few tips, you can easily prevent academic dishonesty and help your students work better. Here’s how.

1.  Ask students to work on a **shared Google Docs** (so you can check from time to time).
2.  Warn them: **no copy and paste** in this doc (if you suddenly see 30 lines appear, it may be suspicious).

![[history.gif | 700]]
  
3.  Warn students you’ll **check history** as well (type `⌘⌥⇧H` to get it faster).
4.  You can say you are going to use the **built-in antiplagiarism** tool in Classroom ([Turn on originality reports](https://support.google.com/edu/classroom/answer/9335816?hl=en)).
5.  Students must always be prepared to **explain their thinking** with their teacher. So, if you are dubious about something that has been written, **consider booking a meeting** with your student and have a conversation.
6.  If you think this is necessary, you can ask students to **keep their camera on** at all times during the exam.
7.  Sometimes **parents are willing to help** to monitor their child. Get in touch with them if you think a student is cheating.
8.  Consider using **Draftback**, a [Chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/draftback/nnajoiemfpldioamchanognpjmocgkbg). It is very impressive and instructive (it feels like you have a time machine and can see everything that has been written).
    
![[draftback.gif | 700]]

9.  Don’t ask a question that can be easily googled. **Ask your students to think, not to repeat** what they learned (or copied).
10. This is on our policies, but remind your students they can **redo and resubmit their work**. They will feel less pressure of failing and therefore of cheating.
11.  **Provide as many feedback as you can**. You can insert audio comment thanks to [Mote](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/mote-voice-notes-feedback/ajphlblkfpppdpkgokiejbjfohfohhmk). You can use Loom to show and explain things through a quick video with [Loom](https://www.loom.com/). Or you can use [Text Blaze](https://blaze.today/) to create a bank of comments you can edit and share with your colleagues.

12.  **Avoid grading**. For the French track, you may want to use what we call the Socle commun de connaissances et de compétences instead.
13.  It appears you can’t grade an essay because of honesty issues? **Turn it into a formative assessment and provide a new summative assessment**.

### Using Exam.net
1. Student is prevented from copy/pasting anything during the exam.
2. The student’s device is locked to the exam environment or the teacher is notified when a student leaves the app.
3. As in Google Docs, the teacher can monitor the progress during the exam and see the history of how the student’s text has evolved. 
4. The teacher can control the time of the exam (when it ends for instance, you can limit the time, force the submission).
5. Plagiarism tool ([Urkund](https://www.urkund.com))
6. You can anonymise the exam (student’s identities are replaced by a codes, and you may reveal the identities after grading the exams
7. Exam.net can be used together with several video conferencing solutions (Meet, Teams...). Exam.net can monitor what the student does on the device while the video solution monitors what happens at the student’s location

### Excerpts
- “cheating-detection program analyzed her behavior through a computer webcam”
- “Online proctoring” companies saw in  [coronavirus](https://www.washingtonpost.com/coronavirus/?itid=lk_inline_manual_9)  shutdowns a chance to capitalize on a major reshaping of education, selling schools a high-tech blend of webcam-watching workers and eye-tracking software designed to catch students cheating on their exams.
- Some students also said they’ve *wept with stress* or *urinated at their desks* because they were forbidden from leaving their screens.
- One system, Proctorio, uses *gaze-detection*, *face-detection* and computer-monitoring software to flag students for any “abnormal” *head movement*, *mouse movement*, *eye wandering*, *computer window resizing*, *tab opening*, *scrolling*, *clicking*, *typing*, and *copies and pastes*. A student can be flagged for *finishing the test too quickly*, or *too slowly*, *clicking too much*, or not enough.<br />If the camera sees someone else in the background, a student can be flagged for having “*multiple faces detected*.” If someone else takes the test on the same network — say, in a dorm building — it’s potential “*exam collusion*.” Room too noisy, Internet too spotty, camera on the fritz? Flag, flag, flag.
- *Is stopping a few cheaters worth the price of treating every student like a fraud?* And how important are any of these tests, really, given the extra stress on students whose lives have already been turned inside out?
- At the software’s core, […] “the most clear value conveyed to students is ‘*We don’t trust you*.’ ”
- They “track their computer activity or connect their microphones and webcams to *large call centers of “proctors” paid to watch the students take their tests*”

> A federal judge this week sided with a student at Cleveland State University in Ohio, who alleged that a room scan taken before his online test as a proctoring measure was unconstitutional.

## 5 Tips for Assessing Students in Remote Teaching

Tip #3 Favoriser le travail collectif (l’élève doit rendre compte de son travail à l’enseignant mais aussi aux autres élèves) -> “they’ll not only have to collaborate in order to produce something for you but they’ll also have to collaborate to present to an authentic audience” 

Tip #5 Grade participation

## Summative Assessment in Distance Learning
[Summative Assessment in Distance Learning](https://www.edutopia.org/article/summative-assessment-distance-learning)

> Using conversations and oral defense: Anthony Poullard, an associate principal at Korea International School, said that “students must always be prepared to explain their thinking or learning with their teacher, and they know that a teacher may ask for an explanation of assessment answers one on one.” In an article on  [formative assessment in distance learning](https://www.edutopia.org/article/formative-assessment-distance-learning) , I discussed conversations as one of the best ways to check for understanding, and this holds true for summative tasks as well. Students can do presentations or engage in an oral explanation or defense of their final product. This provides further evidence of student learning.
