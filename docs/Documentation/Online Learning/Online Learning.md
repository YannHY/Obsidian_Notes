## Collaboration
Collaboration: With the move to distance learning, teachers shifted the tools they were using to facilitate virtual student collaboration. Three tools I was not aware of at the beginning of the school year that have proved to be invaluable are [Parlay](https://parlayideas.com/), [Mentimeter](https://www.mentimeter.com/), and [Mural](https://www.mural.co/). Parlay allows teachers to track discussions virtually as students discuss meaningful texts. Mentimeter allows students and teachers to collect real-time data on students’ questions in the form of word clouds, rankings, and multiple-choice quizzes. Mural is a digital workspace for virtual collaboration that allows teachers and students to post, group, and reorganize ideas in real time.

> Flexible-Pacing  
> Students have the ability to work ahead of pace if they choose. By working ahead in one subject area the student can spend more time in a subject that they may need additional support and time to create learning growth.  

> Competency-Based  
> The full-time online school focuses on students truly learning the information being taught. This gives them the ability to work through assignments and resubmit work to reach their learning goal and mastery of the content.

## How Schools Are Innovating with Emerging Tech

https://edtechmagazine.com/k12/article/2021/05/how-schools-are-innovating-emerging-tech

> Emerging technologies like artificial intelligence, facial recognition and Internet of Things geolocation are making an impact across a variety of industries. K–12 schools are no exception

> MCS paired the RFID cards with a contact tracing and hygiene verification solution. Combined with driver seating charts, the district can now trace contacts. “If we have a student test positive, we go back and refer to the seating chart and then we pull that scanned list and it lets us know all the students that would have been affected,” says Ellis.

> Moving into the new school year this fall, K–12 leaders should plan for students who wish to stick with full-time virtual learning. For those who are eager to return to the classroom, new integrations of technology and a plan for supporting one-to-one devices are must-haves.

## From remote classooms to smart ones

> When countries closed down schools in early 2020 to deal with the COVID-19 pandemic, learning went digital. In the year since, teachers, students and administrators have done, what is effectively, a collective crash course on digital education. [...] But the experience has catapulted education systems, traditionally laggards when it comes to innovation, years ahead in what would have been a slow slouch towards smart schooling.

> Now is the time for schools to dive into digital.

L'idée est que l'enseignement en ligne est provisoire et qu'avec ce "crash course on digital education", on va faire un bond en avant. On a tous adopté la technologie, mais (voir article ci-dessus) c'est l'IA qui va réellement changer les choses (voir partie *What can technology do in smart classrooms?*)
