# Notes Online Teaching

> But those asked only to reheat pre-cooked hamburgers are unlikely to become master chefs. Simply perpetuating our prescriptive approach to teaching will not hold up in this moment of crisis, which demands from teachers not just to replicate their lessons in another medium, but to ﬁnd entirely new responses to what people learn, how people learn, where people learn and when they learn.

> Synchronous learning is online or distance education that happens in real time, often with a set class schedule and required login times. Asynchronous learning does not require real-time interaction; instead, content is available online for students to access when it best suits their schedules, and assignments are completed to deadlines.

### 7 advice

1. First and foremost, you can’t do everything you have done traditionally offline
2. Don’t expect to do the same thing as usually. Everything online takes more time.
3. Prioritise community building. We have to (re)build a strong sense of community, connect student in class and student online... Make them comfortable to speak, to show themselves, to be heard, to express their opinion...
4. During class, focus on one specific task
5. Share courses and practices. More than ever. 
6. use a simple range of tools to not confuse students (and parents)
7. Parents have a role to play, you can lean on them or integrate them, support them, they have to be part of the community (newsletters, survey)...
