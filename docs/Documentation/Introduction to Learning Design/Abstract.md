Schools will become more technological, more computerised, more data driven, more automated, more individualised, so we’re told. However, the inevitability of teaching shaped by machines must not make us forget these questions: what is the pedagogy underpinning the use of technology? What is the role of the teacher?

But that’s not it.

In the midst of the pandemic, how teachers can adapt? Should they simply move away from their lectern, turn on the camera and talk? Or should they embrace the upheaval to reinvent their role? If so, how can they do that? 

But to adapt to a world changing because of permanent imminent disruption or because of a pandemic also requires creativity. That’s why we can say that teaching is both a science and an art. In other words, teaching is not only about delivering content. So how do we run a lesson so the acquisition of content becomes transmogrified into knowledge? 

The answers to all these questions lie in Diana Laurillard’s work: teachers are like engineers who try to make the world a better place using science to design their teaching. And to do that, we have both a tool and a framework: the learning design.

Schools will become more technological, more computerised, more data driven, more automated, more individualised, so we’re told.

But that’s not the only issue.

In the midst of the pandemic, how can teachers adapt? Should they simply move away from their lectern, turn on the camera and talk? Or should they embrace the opportunity to reinvent their role? If so, how can they do that?

To adapt to a world changing because of permanent imminent disruption or because of a pandemic also requires creativity. We can say that teaching is both a science and an art – like a kind of design science. In other words, teaching is not only about delivering content, but also about discovering how best to help our students learn. So how do we run a lesson so the acquisition of content becomes transformed into usable knowledge?

The answers to all these questions lie in Diana Laurillard’s work: teachers are like engineers who try to make the world a better place using teaching as a design science to develop their teaching. To do that, at UCL they have both a framework to represent the teaching-learning process, and a tool to turn that theory into teaching practice. Professor Laurillard will introduce both.

To prepare for the session, please enrol in [this online course](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/blended-and-online-learning-design) (it is free), and watch the first video in Step 1.2 (5 mins), and register on the [Learning Designer](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/learning-designer/) platform (it just requires an email address). If you can bring your laptop to the session you will be able to join in the practice activities.
