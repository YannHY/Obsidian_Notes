Discussing with one of my colleagues, we developed the idea that it would be very useful to produce a tool specifically designed for students so they can better understand the process of learning. They would also become more autonomous if they know exactly what to do to learn something.

They don't need to hear about learning design nor the conversational framework. They just need to know "what it takes to learn" (therefore, the learning types).

I made this video (👇) to explain what are the learning types.

And this gif too:

Here's an example for reading and produce a book review (Year 12/13). Each learning type is correlated to the [[Bloom’s Taxonomy]]. The verbs used in the taxonomy can easily be understood as tasks to accomplish.

⚠️ This is an early draft you can browse in [Trello](https://trello.com/b/cVFpjcyX).

The [Kanban Framework](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanban_board) (it's a board you can easily modify) is simple enough to engage students through a rather complex topic.

> Kanban boards visually depict work at various stages of a process using cards to represent work items and columns to represent each stage of the process. Cards are moved from left to right to show progress and to help coordinate teams performing the work. A Kanban board may be divided into horizontal "swimlanes" representing different kinds of work or different teams performing the work.

I thought it would be convenient for students to visualize the learning types, to modify them, to add their own workflow and proof of work. They also can add links, tags, collaborators and even dates.

This could also be done with,
- [A padlet](https://padlet.com/innovation14/zwlwes08g86con1a)?
- [Miro](https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_lqdTspE=/?invite_link_id=269107618279)?
- Obsidian (with the Kanban plugin)?
- A spreadsheet?
