> It’s **a ==tool== that helps you plan your teaching**. It does this by asking you to **think about the learning experiences** you’re planning for your learners to help them meet their learning outcomes.  ([Eileen Kennedy](https://eileenkennedylearningtech.wordpress.com))

You choose an activity & plan a lesson to teach:

> You put in some context at the beginning including a **title**, **topic**, **description**, **aims** and **outcomes**, how many learners involved. I can link the learning outcomes to [[Bloom’s Taxonomy]] of learning domains. I can specify the length if the learning time I am designing for and the tool will automatically calculate how **much time** I have used. This helps me check I am not planning too much or too little for my learners [...].

> So the next thing to do is to start building the detail. So I click this button which will add what we call **a TLA or a set of teaching and learning activities**. Well I need to give my TLA a name — and I am going to highlight that this will involve individual activities completed online and I need to decide what kind of learning experiences the students should have. I can choose from six learning types: **Read watch listen**, **Collaborate**, **Discuss**, **Investigate**, **Practice**, **Produce** [...]

A **pie chart** shows you the **proportion of activities** that the students are going to experience. You can **==visualize== the design of your lesson plan**.

> This design tool will help with the now urgent process of *moving your teaching online*.  

> The Learning Designer is an **online tool** to help teachers and lecturers design teaching and learning activities and share their learning designs with each other. 

> The tool is based on the **six learning types** from Diana Laurillard’s Conversational Framework – a model of the conditions necessary for learning to take place. The six learning types are: ==Read/Write/Listen (or Acquisition)==, ==Inquiry==, ==Practice==, ==Production==, ==Discussion== and ==Collaboration==. In principle, **a good learning design will contain a mix of all of these types of learning**.  

> The tool provides feedback on your design by showing you (a) the ==amount of learning time== you have designed, and (b) a ==pie chart of the proportion of each of the six learning types== in your design. You decide what adjustments to make. In principle, ==a good learning design will contain a mix of all of these types of learning==. The Analysis tab also shows the ==proportions of time learners spend online==, with the ==teacher present==, and as a ==class, group or individual==.
