## Teachers are engineers
> Teachers are [...] more like engineers – who ==try to make the world a better place==. Like engineers, they use ==science==, where it improves what they do. And like engineers, they use ==feedback==, ==redesigning== their teaching in the light of what happens in practice. “Design engineers” – the term suits what teachers actually do.

> ==UX/UI Design(User Experience/User Interface)==: In another life, I believe I would have been a user experience designer, but alas I’m addicted to education and that elusive light bulb of understanding. That being said the principles of this newly created field need to be a part of our development toolbox.
