### Getting away from this notion of "content delivery"
> Whether it’s in a textbook or in a video-taped lecture, it’s long been the content that matters most in school. The content is central. It’s what you go to school to be exposed to. Content. The student must study it, comprehend it, and demonstrate that in turn for the teacher. ==That is what we expect an education to do, to be: the acquisition of content that becomes transmogrified into knowledge.== (*The Monsters of Education Technology*, 10 The FUTURE of Education: Programmed or Programmable,  Audrey Watters)
