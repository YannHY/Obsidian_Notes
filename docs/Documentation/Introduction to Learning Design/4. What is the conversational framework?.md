What the students have to do in order to understand something?

> Six different types of learning. Learning through ==acquisition== (reading, watching or listening), learning through ==practice==, through ==discussion==, through ==inquiry==, learning through ==collaboration== and through ==production==.

♥️ I really like this example of **discussion**:

> Students are split into groups of 3, where in each group one takes the role of teacher, a second is student, and a third is observer. The ‘teacher’ has to explain concept X to the ‘student’. The ‘student’ has to keep asking questions of clarification until they are clear they understand it. The ‘observer’ takes note of any unanswered questions, to report them back to the class.

So you can ==visualize== the variety of learning types:

> The other part of the learning designer is that it makes you think about ==how you use technology==. Because very often people get stuck with a particular kind of technology and they want to use podcasts or something but it’s very important to understand that all a podcast does is just provide a student with yet another of listening ([Diana Laurillard](https://youtu.be/HEwuIKEKxfE))
