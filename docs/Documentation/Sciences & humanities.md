And if [coders who have only learn computer science] they’ve studied very little of the humanities—history, sociology, literature—they often have what Northrop Frye might have called an “uneducated imagination” [...]

“People with liberal arts degrees, they’re critical thinkers,” says David Kalt, CEO of Reverb [...] he noticed that his most productive developers had all studied humanities, like philosophy or political science [...]

Like many aspects of the digital age, this idea that innovation resides where art and science connect is not new. Leonardo da Vinci was the exemplar of the creativity that flourishes when the humanities and sciences interact. When Einstein was stymied while working out General Relativity, he would pull out his violin and play Mozart until he could reconnect to what he called the harmony of the spheres.
When it comes to computers, there is one other historical figure, not as well known, who embodied the combination of the arts and sciences. Like her famous father, she understood the romance of poetry. Unlike him, she also saw the romance of math and machinery. And that is where our story begins. (Introduction)
-> Ada Lovelace (fille de Byron)

Among the books that inspired Brin were the memoirs of the physicist Richard Feynman, who touted the power that comes from joining art to science the way that Leonardo da Vinci did. “I remember he had an excerpt where he was explaining how he really wanted to be a Leonardo, an artist and a scientist,” said Brin. “I found that pretty inspiring. I think that leads to having a fulfilling life.” (chapter 11 The web )

At his product launches, Steve Jobs would conclude with a slide, projected on the screen behind him, of street signs showing the intersection of the Liberal Arts and Technology. At his last such appearance, for the iPad 2 in 2011, he stood in front of that image and declared, “It’s in Apple’s DNA that technology alone is not enough—that it’s technology married with liberal arts, married with the humanities, that yields us the result that makes our heart sing.” That’s what made him the most creative technology innovator of our era. (chapter 12, Ada forever)

Se rappeler de Diana Laurillard qui compare les enseignants à des ingénieurs :

“Teachers are […] more like engineers – who try to make the world a better place. Like engineers, they use science, where it improves what they do. And like engineers, they use feedback, redesigning their teaching in the light of what happens in practice. “Design engineers” – the term suits what teachers actually do.”
