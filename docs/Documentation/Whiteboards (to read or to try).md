### Miro 
[Miro](https://miro.com/)

It's the Google Docs of whiteboards. Indeed, it has nice [features](https://miro.com/features/). In fact, everything we want to find on a app of its kind: collaboration of course, infinite canvas, feed of every camera...

It is integrated to several apps you may use (Slack, Teams, Google Drive...). It has a marketplace, so you will find a lot of possibilities (plugins, API, SDK...). Really nice. You can create a team and invite people to collaborate (a second teacher for instance)

The free version provides you:

- 3 editable boards
- Anonymous board viewers
- Premade templates
- Core integrations
- Basic attention management

- [See pricing](https://miro.com/pricing/).
