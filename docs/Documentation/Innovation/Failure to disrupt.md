## L'Ancien et le Nouveau
==L'√©cole pr√©pare l'avenir en enseignant le pass√©.==

> Schools and colleges are among the most durable and conservative of our social institutions. ==They prepare people for the future by connecting them with knowledge and wisdom from the past.== Faculty make some accommodations for changing times, but for the most part, instructors teach how they were taught. Schools hold fast.
> *Failure to disrupt*, Introduction, Justin Reich

==Tension entre l'ancien et le nouveau.==

Lu dans [Teaching Machines: A Brief History of "Teaching at Scale"](http://hackeducation.com/2014/09/10/teaching-machines-teaching-at-scale)  (2014) :

> Yesterday was one of those regularly scheduled moments when the technology industry puts that best on display: an Apple keynote, where new products are introduced that have everyone cooing about innovation, that have everyone prepared to declare last year‚Äôs hardware and software obsolete, and often have education technology writers predicting that this is going to revolutionize the way we teach and learn. (Audrey Watters)

‚ûù L'industrie suscite ce discours admiratif devant un renouvellement permanent.

Toute nouveaut√© technologique est porteuse d'une part non n√©gligeable de tradition qui, dans le cas des MOOCs, peut expliquer son √©chec (" ideology is embedded in technology" Audrey Watters. Article cit√© üëÜ)

> Educators and researchers who had been conducting online courses since the 1980s noted that few new MOOCs offered an improved pedagogical experience for distance learners; ==most courses simply recorded a professor lecturing, harkening back to the earliest days of motion pictures when the first order of business was the filming of stage plays.== *Failure to disrupt*, Instructor-guided learning at scale, Massive Open Online Courses, Justin Reich

Nombreux sont ceux qui affirment que telle ou telle technologie va transformer l'√©cole.

> In 2008, Harvard Business School professor Clayton Christensen, with colleagues Michael Horn and Curtis Johnson, published *Disrupting Class*, a book about online learning and the future of K‚Äì12 schools. ==They predicted that by 2019, half of all middle- and high-school courses would be replaced by online options, and ‚Äúthe cost will be one-third of today‚Äôs costs, and the courses will be much better.‚Äù These dramatic changes would be driven by innovators in education technology, or edtech==. One such educator (though he was not identified by name in Disrupting Class), was Salman Khan, who in 2008 founded Khan Academy [...].
> *Failure to disrupt*, Introduction, Justin Reich

Relire, dans *Failure to disrupt*, Instructor-guided learning at scale, Massive Open Online Courses, le passage sur l'√©chec des MOOCs √† r√©volutionner l'√©ducation. On annoncait la fermeture des universit√©s :

> In early 2013, Clayton Christensen [...] warned that within fifteen years, ==‚Äúmaybe half the universities would be in bankruptcy.‚Äù== The concern was that every local college‚Äôs Introduction to Biology course would be replaced by one or two Bio 101 courses taught by rockstar super-professors from elite universities.

Cf. the =="iron triangle"== of **cost**, **access** and **quality** qui √©tait cens√© transformer le syst√®me universitaire.

Cela me rappelle (EDIT : en fait, ce passage est cit√© au tout d√©but de la conclusion)¬†:

> Savez-vous qui a dit¬†: ¬´¬†==Les livres seront bient√¥t obsol√®tes dans les √©coles. Les √©l√®ves recevront un enseignement visuel. Il est possible d‚Äôenseigner tous les domaines de la connaissance humaine par le cin√©ma. Notre syst√®me scolaire va compl√®tement changer d‚Äôici dix ans==. Nous travaillons depuis un certain temps sur les films scolaires. Nous avons √©tudi√© et reproduit la vie de la mouche, du moustique, du ver √† soie, de la mite brune, des papillons et d‚Äôautres insectes, ainsi que la cristallisation chimique. Nos travaux montrent de fa√ßon concluante la valeur des films dans l‚Äôenseignement de la chimie, de la physique et d‚Äôautres domaines, ce qui rend les connaissances scientifiques, difficiles √† comprendre dans les livres, claires et simples pour les enfants.¬†¬ª¬†?
> ==C‚Äôest Thomas Edison, en 1913, dans une interview au *New York Dramatic Mirror*==. Il r√©pondait √† la question ¬´¬†Quel est votre avis sur la valeur p√©dagogique du cin√©ma¬†?¬†¬ª Cette citation donne le vertige¬†:¬†et si le num√©rique nous refaisait le coup du cin√©ma¬†? Quand Thomas Edison disait cela, il √©tait parfaitement honn√™te et raisonnable. Il n‚Äôimaginait peut-√™tre pas √† quel point le cin√©ma allait bouleverser le xxe¬†si√®cle, notre rapport √† la culture, il n‚Äôimaginait peut-√™tre pas qu‚Äôun art majeur √©tait en train de na√Ætre. Mais il n‚Äôimaginait pas non plus que le cin√©ma allait rester en dehors des salles de classe. La valeur p√©dagogique potentielle du cin√©ma est sans doute immense. Sa valeur p√©dagogique r√©elle est tr√®s limit√©e.

‚ûù [Books Will Soon Be Obsolete in the Schools](https://quoteinvestigator.com/2012/02/15/books-obsolete/):

> ‚ÄúBooks,‚Äù declared the inventor with decision, ‚Äúwill soon be obsolete in the public schools. Scholars will be instructed through the eye. It is possible to teach every branch of human knowledge with the motion picture. Our school system will be completely changed inside of ten years.
> ‚ÄúWe have been working for some time on the school pictures. We have been studying and reproducing the life of the fly, mosquito, silk weaving moth, brown moth, gypsy moth, butterflies, scale and various other insects, as well as chemical chrystallization. It proves conclusively the worth of motion pictures in chemistry, physics and other branches of study, making the scientific truths, difficult to understand from text books, plain and clear to children.

## Edward L. Thorndike and John Dewey

_Edward L. Thorndike won and John Dewey lost._

> This lecture-based pedagogical approach goes back millennia. To a first approximation, there are ==only two primary approaches to teaching and learning==. As Plutarch wrote in ‚ÄúOn Listening‚Äù in the first century CE, ‚ÄúEducation is not the filling of a pail, but the lighting of a fire.‚Äù Of course, theories of learning and instruction can be infinitely more complex than this simple dichotomy, but these two perspectives of pail filling and fire lighting appear in various guises throughout the history of schooling and learning. Summarizing these two ideas in the American context, historian Ellen Lagemann argued, ==‚ÄúOne cannot understand the history of education in the United States during the twentieth century, unless one realizes that Edward L. Thorndike won and John Dewey lost.‚Äù==
> In twentieth-century America, philosopher John Dewey became the patron saint of the fire-lighters. Dewey famously argued, ‚ÄúI believe that education, therefore, is a process of living and not a preparation for future living,‚Äù and he advocated for an approach to education that emphasized apprenticeship, interdisciplinary learning, and connections to the world beyond schools. ==Social constructivism‚Äîthe idea that individuals construct new understandings from prior understandings in the context of learning communities‚Äîis one term used by education researchers to capture this family of pedagogies.==
> Edward Thorndike is less well known than Dewey, but his approach to education will be recognizable readily. ==Thorndike believed that education could be organized as a science, in the positivist traditions that shaped sociology, political science, economics, and other social sciences. Thorndike believed that learning could be precisely measured, and he was an early developer and advocate of standardized tests and intelligence testing.== With these measures of learning, best practices in the direct transfer from experts to novices could be standardized and scientifically evaluated. No single term captures all of the pail-filling intellectual decedents of Thorndike‚Äôs thinking, but ==instructionism is a useful label for these ideas.== MOOC developers have been overwhelmingly instructionists.
> New learning technologies rarely innovate on these fundamental pedagogical ideas. Instead, they reenact them. [...] MOOC advocates placed their big bets on innovation in distribution rather than innovations in teaching and pedagogy.

## Adoption de la technologie 
> Even when teachers have adequate support for technology integration, research has shown that adoption of new technologies is a process that usually begins with using new technologies in old ways. (II DILEMMAS IN LEARNING AT SCALE, The Curse of the Familiar)

## Data
### Chapter 8 The Toxic Power of Data and Experiments
List of all the data schools collect about students that first comes to mind:
- name
- date of birth
- transcript data (courses, grades)
- placement test scores,
- address,
- social security number
- residency

But schools and their private subcontractors have data beyond that:

> Schools collect data from individualized education plans, which have detailed information about student disabilities and accommodation plans. School health systems have personal data about medical visits, diagnoses, medications, and vaccinations. Learning-management systems maintain records of learning activities, assignments, and grades for those assignments. School computers log browser histories and website cookies. School email systems and shared workspaces such as Google Docs track student communications. Identity cards, building entry cards, and Wi-Fi connection points can track a student‚Äôs movement throughout a campus. As schools provide more digitally mediated services for students and families ‚Äî such as letting parents log on to portals to see grades or sending notification texts to students when a dryer finishes a run in the college laundry room ‚Äî schools are choosing to collect ever-growing amounts of data about students.

Two immediate conclusions:

> students who are compelled to provide their data cannot provide a truly voluntary, informed consent to subsequent research. 

> For critics, forcing students to participate in widespread data collection is training them for docile acceptance of participation in the surveillance capitalism of advertising technology networks and the growing surveillance state.

Redonner aux √©l√®ves le contr√¥le de leurs donn√©es en leur offrant, comme le sugg√®re Audrey Watters, un h√©bergement en ligne ?

> Today the content we create ‚Äì we all create, but particularly learners create ‚Äì is important, even critical I‚Äôd suggest to the development of our identities, the protection of our well-being. It is not secure in the hands of startups or big corporations ‚Äì these companies go away. It is not secure in the hands of schools. ==Schools are not in the business of long term data storage==, and they increasingly outsource their IT to those very startups and big corporations. We must become the holders of our own data, but not so that we bury all of it away from view. We will want to share it with others on our own terms.
> [...]
> We can reclaim the Web and more broadly ed-tech for teaching and learning. But we must reclaim control of the data, content, and knowledge we create. We are not resources to be mined. ==Learners do not enter our schools and in our libraries to become products for the textbook industry and the testing industry and the technology industry and the ed-tech industry to profit from==. Ed-tech must be not become an extraction effort, and it increasingly is. (*The Monsters of Education Technology*)

C'est en fait la traduction de :
> new technologies do not disrupt existing educational systems. Rather, existing educational systems domesticate new technologies, and in most cases, they use such technologies in the service of the well-established goals and structures of schools. (*Failure to disrupt*, Conclusion)
