What is innovation? 5 questions for 1 definition

## 1. In What year has the following text been written?
The author explain how students benefit from working with teaching machines. I have highlighted some sentences who demonstrate what computers bring to the classroom, to the learning experience.

>  As soon as the student has written his response, ==he operates the machine and learns immediately whether he is right or wrong==. This is a great improvement over the system in which papers are corrected by a teacher where the student must wait perhaps still another day to learn whether or not what he has written is right. Such immediate knowledge has two principal effects. It aids most rapidly to the formation of correct behaviour. The student quickly learns to be right.
>  [...]
>  ==Another important advantage is that the student is free to move at his own pace==. With techniques in which a whole class is forced to move forward together, the bright student wastes time by waiting for others to catch up. And the slow student may not be in theory or in any other respect forced to go too fast.

Traduction en français :

>  Dès que l'élève a écrit sa réponse, ==il actionne la machine et apprend immédiatement s'il a raison ou tort==. C'est une grande amélioration par rapport au système dans lequel les copies sont corrigées par un professeur et où l'élève doit attendre peut-être un jour de plus pour savoir si ce qu'il a écrit est correct ou non. Cette connaissance immédiate a deux effets principaux. Elle contribue très rapidement à la formation d'un comportement correct. L'élève apprend rapidement à avoir raison.
> [...]
> ==Un autre avantage important est que l'élève est libre d'avancer à son propre rythme==. Avec les techniques dans lesquelles toute une classe est forcée d'avancer ensemble, l'élève brillant perd du temps en attendant que les autres le rattrapent. Et l'élève lent ne sera peut-être pas, en théorie ou à tout autre égard, obligé d'aller trop vite.

### Answer
This is the transcript of a video which was shot in in the mid 1950s.

The author explains what are the benefits from using his teaching machine: this "a new way" of studying, it improves how students study, students get immediate feedback, they learn at their own pace.

These are trendy words you can still read on many edtech websites.

Borrowing Audrey Watters' words, I would say that B.F. Skinner’s teaching machine might look like terribly out-of-date but this is the history that still shapes so much of what we say today: self-paced learning, an emphasis on real-time corrections. Edtech today draws heavily on Skinner’s ideas.

Is this really what we want? Behaviorism in our classrooms? Shape our students behaviour? Like Skinner did with pigeons and dogs? Can't we envision something a little more exciting than students seated in front of their computers?

But let's stick with that idea that what we call innovation is sometimes quite old as we just saw. In that case, if nothing is new, what is innovation?

To help you reflect on that, here's a quote (Emmanuel Davidenkoff, *Le Tsunami Numérique*) that tells us that everything has already been done when it comes to pedagogy.

> Hérodote et Érasme pratiquaient la learning expedition ; un directeur de conscience n’a pas grand-chose à envier à un coach ; le serio ludere du Quattrocento italien préfigure les serious games du XXIe siècle ; Célestin Freinet n’avait pas besoin de Twitter pour faire correspondre les élèves ; la flipped classroom (classe inversée) avec son « professeur-précepteur » n’est pas très éloignée du fonctionnement du lycée du XIXe siècle

> Herodotus and Erasmus practised the learning expedition; a director of conscience has little to envy to a coach; the serio ludere of the Italian Quattrocento prefigures the serious games of the 21st century; Célestin Freinet did not need Twitter to make pupils correspond; the flipped classroom with its "teacher-preceptor" is not very far from the functioning of the high school of the 19th century.

One can see the ability of educational innovation to make old ideas seem new. In that regard, I would say that teachers need knowledge of the history of pedagogy.

## 2. If nothing is new, what is innovation?
So we tried everything. But who's we? Humankind? But what about us? What about our school?

I would say that innovation is about bringing something new (*novation*) into something that already exists (*in*). This is not invention. You don't bring something that didn't exist.

I can innovate if I'm doing something that I wasn't doing before. Maybe my fellow teachers were already doing it but not me. Maybe it that something we don't do in my country but that other countries do or other schools do or other parts of the school. For sure, there's something to be learn from primary teachers, from the English track/stream and so on and so forth.

In fact, I would say that innovation is a relative process (not absolute).

But it's important to emphasize that you don't need to invent something to be an innovator. Apple is well known to be an innovative company but they never invented a thing. They didn't invent the phone, nor the watch nor the phone. However, they brought something new in every of the afordementioned devices.

So, we should ask ourselves what could we bring to our school so we are innovating?

List 3 things.

I'll start. I really like this quote from George Couros:

> Effective leadership in education is not about moving everyone from one standardized point to the next but moving individuals from their point “A” to their point ”B.”

> Un "leadership" (direction) efficace dans l'éducation ne consiste pas à faire passer tout le monde d'un point standardisé à un autre, mais à faire passer les individus de leur point "A" à leur point "B".

So my goal is to empower teachers so they get new skills. I will offer training on a weekly basis so, for instance, they become as proficient as possible, say, with Google Workspace for education. They need to take advantage of everything we already have so they can more communicate with students, design the best teaching and learning experience.

But there is a risk and it's called the curse of the familiar (Justin Reich).

To help you reflect on that, a cartoon: one of the women is using a new device, a vacuum cleaner, the way she used to things before the appliance was devised. This is the curse of the familiar (easily adopted technology will be those that replicate existing classroom practices).

> "And even in schools that have the latest technology, teachers and administrators use that advanced equipment to do the same things they did before. A tool that could change education for the better—a laptop, tablet, or interactive white board—too often ends up becoming the equivalent of a thousand-dollar pencil." (George Couros, The Innovator’s Mindset)

> Et même dans les écoles qui disposent des dernières technologies, les enseignants et les administrateurs utilisent ces équipements de pointe pour faire les mêmes choses qu'avant. Un outil qui pourrait changer l'éducation pour le mieux - un ordinateur portable, une tablette ou un tableau blanc interactif - finit trop souvent par devenir l'équivalent d'un crayon à mille dollars.

## 3. What do these next two slides have in common?
Next up, I would like to observe these two slides and the question is What do these next two slides have in common?

In the first one, we have some nice drawings with sketch notes.

The second one is an introduction of a blog post about innovation in education.

> Innovation is a central topic in education today. Innovation is about bringing something new into something existing. It's not invention, which creates from scratch, but the transformation of an existing object or process for better use or efficiency. The word innovation comes from the Latin word "innovatio" and was first used as an insult in Middle Age - meaning a transgression against what was considered to be immutable order (and we can say that its current meaning also denotes upheaval). From Enlightenment onwards, innovation gains a positive meaning. It is an improvement in living conditions. Nowadays, innovation is seen as a cornerstone in education and it is said that schools must innovate. Educators are called to innovating their pedagogy in order to produce young people who are prepared for the contemporary world and be able to create or make the innovations they will need. 

> L'innovation est un sujet central dans l'éducation aujourd'hui. L'innovation consiste à apporter quelque chose de nouveau à quelque chose d'existant. Il ne s'agit pas d'une invention, qui crée à partir de rien, mais de la transformation d'un objet ou d'un processus existant pour une meilleure utilisation ou efficacité. Le mot "innovation" vient du latin "innovatio" et a été utilisé pour la première fois comme une insulte au Moyen Âge - signifiant une transgression de ce qui était considéré comme un ordre immuable (et nous pouvons dire que son sens actuel dénote également un bouleversement). À partir du siècle des Lumières, l'innovation acquiert une signification positive. Elle correspond à une amélioration des conditions de vie. De nos jours, l'innovation est considérée comme une pierre angulaire de l'éducation et il est dit que les écoles doivent innover. Les éducateurs sont appelés à innover dans leur pédagogie afin de former des jeunes qui soient préparés au monde contemporain et capables de créer ou de réaliser les innovations dont ils auront besoin. 

The answer to that question is that none of them have been created by a human person. Midjourney, GPT-3… Machines are doing human jobs.

Is AI a threat?

Yes and no.

Think about Kasparov loosing against Deep BLue. Was is still worth it to play chess since the machines were more powerful than human beings (and truly one can see now thirty years after that no one has given up on chess. On the contrary).

Kasparov's idea was that it's no use to compete with machines. Instead, we should learn to work with machines (Centaur's metaphor). Indeed, I see great opportunity using OpenAI and for instance it's last product (Whisper). One can easily a time where a journalist speaking only german will be able to have a conversation with a chinese one. Machines will do the real time translation (and for that matter, you'll get a full transcript with important passages underlined). And to be fair, it's really not SF (think of Otter for instance).

So I guess our good old Four Cs are still relevant today. We need to learn to collaborate for instance. And we desperatly need digital skills. The EU reminds us that 42% who are currently unemployed don't have digital competences.

But one can easily see that AI is going to destroy the jobs that can be automated (See Yuval Noah Harari about that). But what we said remains true: our students need skills that we'll spare them from being easily replaced.

## 4. What is left to human beings?
This quote makes me laugh.

> "When I read about autowriters and autograders, I like to imagine students downloading and running computer programs that automatically write essays while instructors use computers to automatically grade those essays. While the computers instantaneously pass these essays and grades back and forth, students and instructors can retire to a grassy quad, sitting together in the warm sun, holding forth on grand ideas and helping each other learn." (Justin Reich, Failure to Disrupt)

> Lorsque je lis des articles sur les rédacteurs et les correcteurs automatiques, j'aime imaginer que les étudiants téléchargent et exécutent des programmes informatiques qui rédigent automatiquement des dissertations, tandis que les instructeurs utilisent des ordinateurs pour noter automatiquement ces dissertations. Pendant que les ordinateurs transmettent instantanément ces dissertations et ces notes, les étudiants et les enseignants peuvent se retirer sur une pelouse, s'asseoir ensemble au soleil, discuter de grandes idées et s'aider mutuellement à apprendre.

First, it brings back to our first point. We have something more interesting that putting every students on a computers with an adaptative tutor or an AI software. Secondly, it reminds us that machines are there to do the tedious work.

But let's answer to that question What is left to human beings?

In fact, we alredy answered this but I do believe that powerful machines are going not to kill creativity but to spark it. That's really one can see when loggin on a Discord channel and see what you can do with Midjourney, people creating new drawings even comics.

Finally, I would argue that machines would be our new gods. According to Bidar, by conceiving deity, we have a model to compete with.

> Le coup de génie est là : en concevant quelque chose comme le divin, c’est-à-dire l’être supérieur en tout et supérieur à tout, au temps, à l’espace, à la vie, à la mort, l’être humain se donne à lui-même le défi suprême d’entrer en dialogue avec cet interlocuteur sublime, d’exister par soi-même face à cet adversaire tout-puissant, de s’élancer sans fin vers cet horizon irrattrapable. (Abdennour Bidar, Histoire De l'Humanisme en Occident)

> The stroke of genius is there: by conceiving something like the divine, that is to say the being superior in everything and superior to everything, to time, to space, to life, to death, the human being gives himself the supreme challenge of entering into dialogue with this sublime interlocutor, of existing by himself in the face of this all-powerful adversary, of rushing endlessly towards this irrecoverable horizon.

Of course, that's a joke. But isn't something great that you can train yourself to better at chess using a computer or to learn a foreign language?

What about you? What would you say. List three things that machines can’t perform or tell how AI will transform education (note that I’m not saying disrupting).

## 5. Why do we need to innovate?
This is the final question.
We saw what is innovation and how we could innovate. We also gave one reason to innovate, to bring technology into the classroom so our students gain new skills. But there's is more than that.

So why should schools innovate? Why this word became so trendy? Why is it absolutely necessary? Or not if you think so.

There's a lot to be said about that (and particurlaly why this word became trendy) but I would focus on one thing. The world is on fire. We desperatly need to educate people not to destroy the earth, not to saw off the branch on which they are sitting.

In 1934, the great Swiss psychologist Jean Piaget said, “Only education is capable of saving our societies from possible collapse”.

Well, isn't it more true than ever? A war, a pandemic, global warming...

So how would you modify the curriculum so it fits these new urgent needs? Can you list three things?

## Conclusion
Our initial question was What is innovation?

Let's sum up.

 Innovation is about bringing something new into something that already exists. This is not invention. You don't bring something that didn't exist. But we also saw the ability of educational innovation to make old ideas seem new.

Innovation a relative process. You may doing something new that your fellow teachers were already doing but you were not. So, we need to invite teachers to try new things. It can be a lot of things (a new pedagogical approch, a new app, a new way of collaborating...).

We need to forster that willingness to try new things by creating opportunities (teacher are able to meet each other, to work together, to collaborate...). Having an Innovation Day or a Passion Day would be meaningful. People would share their passion. We would need a place where students could build things (fablabs)...
I would add that more than every teachers have to team up with computers. They are not a the center of the stage anymore. They are more the guide on the side (using AI among other things).

But why do we want to innovate?
Like any startup in Silicon Valley, we could say we want to make the world a better place. We wan't students to work better and to be happy. So innovation is a positive word.

We need to innovate so the education we provide is helping students to overcome challenges. Let's remember that, according to the EU, 42% of people currently unemployed have no digital skills whatsoever.
Also, we need to innovate because it is now urgent. War, pandemic, global warming are wreaking havoc. We desperatly need to educate students. "Only education is capable of saving our societies from possible collapse", said Jean Piaget.
