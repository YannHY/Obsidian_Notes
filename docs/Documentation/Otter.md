First mentioned in [[One way to improve your studentsâ€™ oral skills & Otter, a lovely app]] (the goal was to help students by providing a transcription of the Zoom meeting) but it occurred to us that this could be handy for HOD when interviewing candidates.

Just fire up Zoom in one side, Otter on the other side and press record (it will only work on a computer not on an iPad because of the OS limitations).

It's a collaborative tool so you can create groups (and much more: tags, comments, highlights...).

Can be used to get a transcript of a podcast.
