Just sharing some interesting resources for the PSHE curriculum I found for my year 9 students. Of course, resources for other year groups can be found by clicking these links.

Basically, I have selected five websites:

1. Be Internet Citizen
2. Common Sense
3. Applied Digital Skills
4. Pix
5. Anti-Bullying Week 2021

I hope you'll find this useful.

## Be Internet Citizen
-> ['Be Internet Citizens' lessons, KS3-4](https://www.pshe-association.org.uk/curriculum-and-resources/resources/be-internet-citizens-lessons-ks3-4)

The lessons explore:
-   how to identify online disinformation and misinformation
-   how filter bubbles and echo chambers affect the information we see
-   the impact of bias in writing and how bias is used online
-   the consequences of stereotyping, for individuals and society
-   freedom of speech and how to challenge online bullying or hate speech

### Chatting and Red Flags
[Chatting and Red Flags - How can you tell when an online relationship is risky?](https://www.commonsense.org/education/digital-citizenship/lesson/chatting-and-red-flags)

Having conversations online, without nonverbal cues or being able to see people, can be awkward and sometimes even risky -- with drawbacks from simple misunderstandings to manipulation or inappropriate messages. Help students navigate and avoid these situations before they go too far.
