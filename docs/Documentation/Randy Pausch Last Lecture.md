## No footballs
During a training, the coach didn't bring any footballs.

> How are we going to have practice without any footballs? And one of the other kids said, "Excuse me, coach, but there's no football." And coach Graham said, "Right, how many men are on a football field at a time?" "11 on a team, 22." And coach Graham said, "All right, and how many people are touching the football at any given time?" "One of them" and he said, "Right, so we're going to work on what those other 21 guys are doing."

##  Your critics or your one's telling you they still love you and care
> He just rode me all practice, just, "You're doing this wrong. you're doing this wrong, go back and do it again. You owe me, you're doing pushups after practice". And when it was all over, one of the other assistant coaches came over and said, "Yeah, Coach Graham, rode you pretty hard, didn't he?" and he said, "Yeah", he said, "That's a good thing". He said, "When you're screwing up, and nobody's saying anything to you anymore, That means they gave up".
> And that's a lesson that stuck with me. My whole life is that when you see when you see yourself doing something badly and nobody's bothering to tell you anymore, That's a very bad place to be your critics or your one's telling you they still love you and care. 

## Just Give Them Time
Randy Pausch quoting Jon Snoddy:
> "Wait long enough, and people will surprise and impress you" He said, "When you're pissed off at somebody and you're angry at them, you just haven't given them enough time. Just give them a little more time, and they'll almost always impress you".
