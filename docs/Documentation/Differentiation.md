Of course, you’ve heard about differentiation! You may have read a lot about it in fact. And you certainly known that differentiate is necessary even sometimes mandatory, but what is it exactly and how do we do that? What this means in practice?

Well, as a start, I love to quote this sentence from Ken Robison in *Creative schools*:

> One of the perils of standardized education is the idea that one size fits all. (chapter 9, Bring it all back home)

This is quite self-explanatory and I don’t want to state the obvious but this means that, most of the time, teachers need to tailor their lesson to fit the learning need of students.

You probably saw this picture:

So it’s all about giving students of all capabilities the best chance of learning. And to do that, at Lycée International de Londres Winston-Churchill, we have a large range of possibilities. We can show you concrete and working examples of truly amazing differentiated activities.

## French
In French, we have this particular exercice we call “dictée”. It’s a spelling exercice. Basically, the teacher dictates a text and students try their best to write it down. Traditionally, everyone is writing the same text, at the same moment, at the same pace.

![](Dict%C3%A9es.png)

But, in our school, we do things differently.

1. We don’t provide one exercise for the all class but up to four. Each exercise represents one level of difficulty: the first one is the easiest. We call it the “green track”. The second one is a little bit more difficult. This is the “blue track”. The third becomes quite complex. This is the “red track”. And the last one, the “black track”, is very challenging.
2. The teacher records these spelling exercices in an mp3 format. These records are embedded [in a book](https://www.ralentirtravaux.com/manuels/dictees.php) (an ePub made with [Pages](https://www.apple.com/uk/pages/)). Students can listen to them at their own pace and even redo them if they failed. All they need is their iPad, headphones, a pen and a piece of paper.
3. When it comes to assessing, we have a flexible method: students can repeat the assessment as many times as necessary.

We teach grammar the same way we teach spelling. We are making different groups of different levels. [In a book](https://books.apple.com/gb/book/manuel-de-grammaire/id971835630), students have the entire curriculum of the year and even more! According to the group in which they are, they will have to do specific exercises. It is a kind of menu. 

![](Grammar.jpeg)

All students have a spreadsheet in which they tell the teacher where they are in the process of learning grammar. They can say: “Everything’s OK. I’m working”, “I’m struggling. Please help me” or “I’m done. I want to do the test”. 

Thanks to Google Classroom and a formula called `IMPORT RANGE` in Google Spreadsheet, all these information is gathered in the teacher’s spreadsheet. As students work in an autonomous way (of course they can help each other), if they did not pass the test, they can ask for another one.

## Physic
The Physic teacher send a [Google form](https://docs.google.com/forms/) to his students. For instance, an exercice with questions about gravitation (simple questions like True or False). By going to `Settings` then `Quizzes` and choosing `Make this a quiz`, he is able to grade students automatically.

He then exports results in a spreadsheet where he inserted a column labelled “Score final”. It simply fetches the grade with a formula which basically says if the grade is higher than this, it is OK (and it is green). If not, this is not OK and it is red. Something like this `=if(A1>=10, “ok”, “no”)`.

In the spreadsheet, he also added two columns. The first one is a link leading to the correction. The second one indicates the next step: redo the quiz or go to the next stage of the lesson.

Finally, using the add-on [form Mule](https://gsuite.google.com/marketplace/app/form_mule_email_merge_utility/968670674230), he sends automatically to all students their results and the instructions: everything’s ok? So read the correction, follow the next step. The student failed? Read some extra explanations, take the quiz one more time, etc.

## Math
Render unto Caesar the things which are Caesar's. The math teacher is the inventor of a well-known metaphor in our school. The black piste for instance is a pretty steep and difficult one. This is for experts. A red piste is moderately difficult. The green track exercises are consolidation or remedial exercises. Thus one or more exercises are available to help students acquire and master the concept.

In these exercices, students can follow several paths but all of them have to achieve mandatory exercices. But differentiation is also about helping students to work at their own pace. If this one works really fast, this other student may need a little bit of extra-time.

## English
Let’s stay in the sport’s field.

During English lessons, at the beginning of the year, students have a test, the same test for everyone, say in year 8. After this test, students may be put in a different group: Bronze, Silver or Gold.

![](EnglishTest.png)

As you can see on the above screenshot, students are given different exercices according to their level.

- Bronze level: Match the pictures with the text on Classroom.
- Silver level: Write down what the name of each activity is.
- Gold level: Write the name of each activity and then a sentence about three, saying how much you enjoy it.

As for the exercises of the red and black courses, they allow students who are the most comfortable with a notion to go deeper, to go further, to challenge themselves. These exercises go off the beaten track. They are generally research exercises, open-ended problems. They can introduce a concept that will be developed in a subsequent year.

## German
![](GermanThinglink.png)

I love this use of [Thinglink](https://www.thinglink.com/scene/1005524436880719874) as it offers a very nice and understandable view of the work that must be accomplished by students. As you can see on the above screenshot, we have an image of mountains to climb. There are three paths which correspond to three levels of difficulty.

## Art
This is a nice project: students have to build arcade games using [Microsoft MakeCode](https://arcade.makecode.com/#) (if you don’t know what it is, just have a look at this page: [What is Microsoft MakeCode?](https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/makecode/about)). To sum things up: 

> Microsoft MakeCode is a free, open source platform for creating engaging computer science learning experiences that support a progression path into real-world programming.

In this project, students are all doing the same activity. The lesson plan is displayed on the board. Everyone follow the instructions and work autonomously. By doing that way, the teacher is free to grant some time to the students who need the most of her help while the more able are working alone (they have all they need, all the resources: tutorials, videos and so on). Some of these students are the “pillars” of the class and students who seek help can rely on them if they have any questions.

In addition to that, the grading has also been adapted. The more you invest yourself on the project, the more you are rewarded. For instance, if you were involved but didn’t really succeed, you got a 4 out fo 4. Nevertheless, if you are very gifted but not involved, you don’t end up with more than a 2 out of 4.

Have a look on this great game made by a student: [Do not catch Corona!](https://arcade.makecode.com/17781-65144-88007-84099) That is awesome!

![](ArcadeGame.png)

For the IBDP class, in Art, the differentiation that takes place is that we must look at all of the students individually to see which artists they are inspired by, and ensure that their own ideas incorporate the ideas of their artists. In these slides, you can see that each individual student has their own slides dedicated to them, which explains what they must do for their homework.

## NSI
In the French curriculum, NSI stands for “Numérique et Sciences Informatiques” (which can be translated by something like “Digital and Computer sciences”). Students learn Python, among other things.

The teacher gives an activity divided in two parts: a quiz (this is the first part) and exercices (this is the second part). Depending on which result they get in the quiz, students receive only certain exercices in the second part.

The quiz is made with Google Forms so students get immediate results. The code is written in [Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).

If you don’t know Colab, have a look at the [FAQ](https://research.google.com/colaboratory/faq.html):

> Colaboratory, or “Colab” for short, is a product from Google Research. Colab allows anybody to write and execute arbitrary python code through the browser, and is especially well suited to machine learning, data analysis and education.
