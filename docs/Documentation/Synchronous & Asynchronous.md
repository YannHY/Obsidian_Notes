## Asynchronous vs. Synchronous: How to Design for Each Type of Learning
ðŸ”— [Link](https://catlintucker.com/2020/08/asynchronous-vs-synchronous/)

### Asynchronous Learning
Asynchronous learning is ==the type of learning you do alone==, on your account, and ==at your own pace==. Asynchronous learning most frequently refers to teacher and student ==interactions that occur at different times and different locations==.

Great examples of asynchronous e-learning can be found in online courses (Moocs like Udemy or Coursera, YouTube, email exchanges...).

- Occurring at ==different times and in different places== (e.g., students working at home).
- Students can ==access content, resources, activities at any time, and from anywhere==.
- ==Students can control the time, place, and pace== of their learning.
- Students work ==independently== to complete assignments and tasks.

### Synchronous Learning
- ==Occurring at the same time and in the same place== (e.g., students working in the classroom or meeting online for a video conference session.
- Students can ==access content, resources, and activities at a specific time and location==.
- Students may have some control over the pace of their learning, but ==they do not control the time or the place==.
- Students have ==access to teacher and peer support while completing assignments and tasks==.

### Asynchronous learning activities
Asynchronous learning provides students with ==a high degree of flexibility and autonomy==. They can control the pace of their learning, which lends itself to the following activities.

Teachers who are seeing students for synchronous face-to-face sessions in a classroom or virtual conferencing sessions online may find it useful to ==think of the asynchronous learning as pre-work and post-work for the synchronous sessions==.

[...]

If students engage in meaningful pre-work prior to class, the teacher can maximize their limited synchronous time with students in a blended learning or online learning course. They can focus their time and energy on high-value learning activities when working directly with students. Instead of feeling pressure to cover the curriculum or present information, the teacher can use their precious synchronous time to do the following.
