## What Is Hybrid Learning?
Hybrid or Blended learning is understood as ==a mixed approach that combines learning in school with online learning==.

There are **different combinations**. As a response to the pandemic, the most common hybrid model groups students and **alternate days on-site and off-site**.

### Combining Online & On-site Learning

### Synchronous & Asynchronous learning
**Synchronicity means everyone is doing something at the same time, in the same room, learning the same thing**. That's what synchronous learning is. **Asynchronous is the opposite: students and the teacher are not engaged in the process at the same time, there is no real-time interaction**. And no-one is in the same space. But we can take advantage of that: using breakout rooms for instance. Teachers are not dealing with 20 to 30 students in the same space at the same time. It's an opportunity to make everyone work at his/her own pace, on specific and differentiated topics. Teachers can deal with them as individuals with no one interfering. ([Everything you need to know about remote teaching](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vu1UeVclfi4eVGSI-mHrMGe59l3VgdpSOjAzS-uGQb0/edit#heading=h.8pkijye7ilft))

Hybrid schedules often use a combination of both. **Students who are off-site work asynchronously and students who physically present engage in a synchronous way**.

### Teaching synchronously to both in-person and remote students
At the time of this writing, ==this is how we are doing hybrid learning==. But, in fact, we have very few students attending from home. It’s a completely different story if you have to deal with a lot of students whether they are working from home and working at school.

<table>
<tr>
	<th><strong>Monday</strong></th>
	<th><strong>Tuesday</strong></th>
	<th><strong>Wednesday</strong></th>
	<th><strong>Thursday</strong></th>
	<th><strong>Friday</strong></th>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>On Site & Remote</td>
	<td>On Site & Remote</td>
	<td>On Site & Remote</td>

	<td>On Site & Remote</td>
</tr>
</table>

==The workload for the teachers should be acceptable **if students learning from home work asynchronously while students physically present have to work synchronously**==. Indeed, being attentive to both remote and in-person students can be very challenging.

### Appointment Slots in Google Calendar
Students online must be able to talk to their teacher when they need to:

1. in **Google Calendar** > Appointment slots (very convenient to book an appointment)
2. in **Google Groups** (a group class discussion fostering collaboration and peer support)

![[appointment-slots.png | 700]]
### Provide your Zoom link
Head to [zoom.us](https://zoom.us/) > Meetings > Personal Room and get `Invite Link`.

### Adapting the curriculum? (to complete)
Separate curriculum for PE
Use Edpuzzle with videos and exercises
Register to a club

### Work at your own pace
Google Classroom must be full of **activities for independent students**.

![[Séquence 3 A l'aventure.png | 700]]
Use Applied Digital Skills

### Attendance
#### Pronote
Roll call

#### Zoom
Forgot or didn't have time to check who was attending? Check `Reports > Usage > Select the date`.

![[Documentation/Images/Hybrid learning/zoom.png | 700]]
You’ll see a detailed list of your attendees including the exact time they logged on and off.

#### Google Classroom
Just ask a simple question (scheduled it).

## How to help students with remote learning?
While teachers are teaching to students physically presents, we may imagine two different scenarios:

1.  Teachers answer students whether they attend online or in-person. The course is live-streamed and everyone can participate in real-time. In addition, students at home can collaborate with students in the classroom.
2.  Teachers can not answer to students attending online. They are too busy. But we can provide coaches (the teachers who are not teaching but are covering any potential absent teachers and are ready to replace him or her).

We could have an online CTL helping students working from home.

In fact, a student working from home has a coach. A student working from school has a teacher.

Of course, all lessons are created by the classroom teacher and posted on Google Classroom. Instructions too. Assignments are graded by this teacher. But it is the coach that helps online students (only it’s not feasible by the teacher him/herself during class. It depends).

## Who wants hybrid learning?
-   Students having extracurricular activities (athletic careers, music)
-   Students with special needs experimenting anxiety
-   Students having medical conditions
-   Students that have been homeschooled

Any absence, snowdays should be addressed thanks to online classes.

## How to inform students and parents about hybrid learning?
Induction day (both for parents and students)
Welcome students attending online (Zoom meeting)

## Parents
[Declaration of Learning Models 2021-2022](https://www.tvdsb.ca/en/our-board/declaration-of-learning-models.aspx#) (At Thames Valley, parents are being asked to indicate which type of learning they're interested in putting their children in for the coming school year):

> Please note that the learning model you choose is for the full 2021-22 school year. Large movements of students between In-Person Learning and Full-Remote Learning can cause considerable disruptions to many students, including those who are not changing learning model themselves. Therefore, your choice of In-Person Learning or Full-Remote Learning will represent a full-year commitment.

Make a document to explain parents the difference between in-person and online learning so they can make a choice.

## Students
Students need to be informed as they would be if they were attending in person and the teacher would be available to answer any questions.

➝ Student’s guide (ePub, website?)
-   How to log in to your Google Account?
-   What are the apps we use (Zoom, Pronote, Google apps)?
-   ...
    
➝ Google Groups for remote learners (?)

## How to provide students with a device?
1. APLIL is offering its help to deliver the iPads.
2. Mail delivery(?)
3. One induction day at the beginning of the year

## What should every teacher know about hybrid learning?
Making this new type of learning work well can be challenging. Teachers must be able to keep both in-person and online students engaged.

### Key points:
-   Prioritise community building
-   Alternate synchronous and asynchronous learning -> Catlin Tucker
-   A student working from home is a fast learner (“Research shows that online learning requires 40-60 percent less time to learn than in a traditional classroom setting” in 3 hybrid learning strategies to consider)
-   Find which types of activities are best suited for online vs in-person learning (content delivery can be done online but teachers need to focus on skills when students are in class)
-   Help students individualising their learning, becoming self-directed learners (a Google Classroom should contains many, many activities)
-   Involve students in the classroom community (use Google Groups so they can answer a question one has)
-   “Blended learning is a way to move towards a competency-based approach” (in Blended learning in school education) (important when it comes to assess)
-   Students (whether attending in-person or online) should interact with each other
-   Design your lesson plan (-> Diane Laurillard)

### Whiteboards
Read [[Discover the power of whiteboards apps]]

## What apps to buy?
-   We have a LMS (learning management system) such as Google Classroom.
-   Primary relies on Paddlet
-   Teachers may need tools such as Nearpod or Quizzlet to question and track student’s work?
-   Enhance the Zoom experience (which was not primarily designed for teaching and learning). Read this [Wired article](https://www.wired.com/story/class-engageli-online-learning-platforms/) about [Class](https://www.class.com/) (some kind of add-on for Zoom).

## How to engage students?
### Daily life
Online students must take part to regular assemblies
Participate in a club (book club, chess club, debate club…)
Socialise students with peer counseling (it can be seen as volunteering)

### In class
Project based learning
Flipped classroom
Autonomy (see what I do with students: grammar & dictées)
One group practising in class, the other half learning independently from home

Accompagner les élèves pour qu’ils deviennent des apprenants autonomes et indépendants
