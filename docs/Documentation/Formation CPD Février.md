Hi everyone,

I hope everyone’s OK and that you enjoyed the all experience of remote learning before you enjoy a well-deserved break.

We have only half an hour to talk about a lot of things -(I’m not going to complain (those of you who presented their favorite apps or something had only 5 minutes)- So let’s get started.

You can find this presentation on my Google Classroom. I’ll put the link on the chat as well.  [Google Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/13Cw3oaDDSj8PhOOju7gtwu3miOfNzLuzASguFhSYY78/edit#slide=id.gbb12567bcf_0_90)

By the way, I like this cartoon Camie shared. It really shows how different the remote learning experience can be whether you are in secondary or in elementary. We all must have experienced things differently actually.

OK. So, you can react, comment, ask a question in this presentation. Don’t hesitate.

To give you a quick glance of the content of this presentation, please refer to this slide.

1. Survey
2. Tutorials
3. Zoom
4. Setup
5. Remote learning
6. Learning design
7. The four Cs
8. Pix

And let’s start with a quick survey: how are you? Tell me if you’ve been happy with your remote teaching or not. Just drag and drop the happy or sad emojis on the table. If you don’t really know, you have a column in the middle of this table (down below, you’ll find the appropriate emoji). Therefore, we’ll have a quick view of your feelings about remote learning.

So, now is the time to explain, to tell me a little bit more about what you think. I made a Google form. Take a moment to have a look. -You can answer later or right now if you want while I speak-. The link will be in the chat as well. [Google Forms](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeydFRHxpqLeNVLWduNPA4DwPbL5nrQRo4iGzQauiLLEFHKTg/viewform)

In the meantime, please remember that I made this Classroom for you and you can find some tutorials like these ones. I hope this is useful.

OK. Let’s start with Zoom.

I want to be sure that everyone has the latest version of the Zoom client. It’s very important. Every update brings new features and security patches as well. So this is important. Just to check, could someone please fill these two boxes and tell me what is the latest version of Zoom on a computer or an iPad?

Speaking of security, we do want to avoid Zoom bombing, do we? So make sure that you visit the zoom.us website, head to the settings section and enable these features.

- Enable the waiting room and only accept people you can identify.
- Require a passcode for any meetings.
- If you have any problem with the chat, disable it (In Meeting (Basic) > Chat)
- Toggle on “Only authenticated users can join meetings” (but do not forget to turn it off when parent conferences occur).

Last but not least, in the settings again, go to Background & Filters to add a beautiful virtual background. You can upload your own photos. Since very recently, we have the blur option I really like (we add it in Microsoft Teams and Google Meet but until now not in Zoom)
And keep in mind you can touch up your appearance too. This is a nice feature. But maybe you will say that I’m vain.

To finish this part dedicated to Zoom, I just want to quickly speak about the setup. It occurred to me that if I had to spend so much time on Zoom, I would need to invest a little bit and after some reading, I end up buying a brand new mic and a stand for my phone which I use as a way better camera than the one on my computer.

I probably won’t stop here and will buy new toys but you know… But I really think it improves the Zoom experience. If one day, we are going to offer full online classes, we will have to reflect on that.

In addition, listen to the tips provided by this guy. If you play the video, it will start with one I find very useful: look at the people you are talking to. When we speak on Zoom, we are staring at our computer or maybe ourselves but if you want to make this like a live experience, look at the camera. If you want to talk to people, you have to look at the camera. Makes sense? It’s a little awkward. I can’t get used to it but I wanted to share that with you.

Now, I’d like to talk more specifically about remote learning. This week I read this article in Medium. The title is *Online Learning Is Not The Problem, Bad Design Is* and one can read “Before Claiming That Online Learning Sucks, Remember That Poor *Design* Leads to Poor Outcomes”.  And the word I find very interesting is “design”. If we want to be successful in online teaching, we have to /design/ our learning. That’s something I’ve already said in the past but let me insist.

Someone who would only talk to the camera, well, it would be like some kind of “premium […] YouTube version of education”, which is quite appalling, and that’s not what we want. That’s why we need to design our lessons so that they are more engaging, more efficient.

And to do that, well, we’ve got something. We have got the learning designer.

Very often, we compare teaching to art and this is pretty relevant for a lot of things. But teachers are, like Diana Laurillard said, more like engineers.

“Teachers are […] more like engineers – who try to make the world a better place. Like engineers, they use science, where it improves what they do. And like engineers, they use feedback, redesigning their teaching in the light of what happens in practice. “Design engineers” – the term suits what teachers actually do.”

Indeed, we do make the world a better place. Just have a look at our values.  And we use science, we read what the research says.  We use feedback from our colleagues, from our students, from parents.

So this is true, teachers are like engineers. And according to Diana Laurillard, a well-designed lesson is based on the *six learning types*.

1. Read/Write/Listen (or Acquisition), 
2. Inquiry,
3. Practice,
4. Production,
5. Discussion,
6. Collaboration.

In principle, a good learning design will contain a mix of all of these types of learning. And to do that, we have a tool. It’s called the learning designer.

> It’s a tool that helps you plan your teaching. It does this by asking you to think about the learning experiences you’re planning for your learners […].  

You choose an activity & plan a lesson to teach.

> You put in some context at the beginning including a title, topic, description, aims and outcomes, how many learners involved. I can link the learning outcomes to Bloom’s taxonomy […]. I can specify the length of the learning time I am designing for and the tool will automatically calculate how much time I have used. This helps me check I am not planning too much or too little for my learners [...].  
> So the next thing to do is to start building the details. So I click this button which will add […] a TLA […] a set of teaching and learning activities.   

If you want to know more about the learning designer, you can have a look at this video. Or visit my Classroom, I shared some notes about it. And of course, if you need help, drop me a line, I’ll be happy to assist you in creating your first design.

Anyway, what I want you to understand today is that you design your lesson and you end up with nice charts showing you the proportions of your design and then you decide what adjustments you want to make.

It’s also a great opportunity to ask yourself if you are promoting a teacher centred model or on the contrary a more constructivist approach. You can also reflect on what is more appropriate: synchronous or asynchronous. I think this is a well-known thing so I won’t develop it and I think we are running out of time.

Finally, I want to mention “*ABC Learning design on a spreadsheet*. It has been made by two friends of mine and this is really a great tool. The learning designer is great but it’s not very convenient to share. You can’t really collaborate on one of your design. Well, with this Spreadsheet it is.

This presentation comes to an end. I just want to say before finishing that online learning is a great opportunity to work on the 4 Cs.

I was reading /21 lessons for the 21st century/ from Yuval Noah Harari, the author of /Sapiens/. It’s really impressive. In one chapter, he’s talking about education and says that in a world “flooded by enormous amounts of information”, “the last thing a teacher needs to give her pupils is more information”.

> So what should we be teaching? Many pedagogical experts argue that schools should switch to teaching ‘the four Cs’  […].  

The four Cs are:

1. critical thinking,
2. communication,
3. collaboration,
4. creativity

And when we read our values, we clearly see that they are made to foster these skills. And it’s a great pleasure to see our students making big creative projects, communicating, collaborating especially when you know that for the first time in history we teach to people who are not in the same room, at the same time, doing the same thing as the rest of the class.

So this is quite challenging and fascinating.

All right, now I’d like to say a quick word about Pix. As it is intended to French teachers, if you are not and want to leave, feel free to go.

## Slide 7

Now let’s talk about remote learning.
This week, I read this article in Medium saying:

> *Online Learning Is Not The Problem, Bad Design Is*  
> Before Claiming That Online Learning Sucks, Remember That Poor Design Leads to Poor Outcomes  

https://link.medium.com/VJsqxdOEydb

![](bad-design.jpg)

It says nothing more that I have already told but it is said in a pretty punchy way. For instance, I like this sentence:

> no one wants to pay a premium for a youtube version of education.  

-> Importance of the design

## Slide 8
Learning designer

> “Teachers are [...] more like engineers – who try to make the world a better place. Like engineers, they use science, where it improves what they do. And like engineers, they use feedback, redesigning their teaching in the light of what happens in practice. “Design engineers” – the term suits what teachers actually do.”  

Diana Laurillard

According to Diana Laurillard, a good learning design contain a mix of six types of learning:

* ==Read/Write/Listen (or Acquisition)==, 
* ==Inquiry==,
* ==Practice==,
* ==Production==,
* ==Discussion==,
* ==Collaboration==. 

And a tool, a website has been made so you can design your learning using all these types of learning.

It’s a simple but very effective way of designing your learning. To start designing your, visit the UCL website.

![](learning-design.jpg)

The tool provides feedback on your design by showing you the *amount of learning time* you have designed, a *pie chart of the proportion of each of the six learning types*. You decide what adjustments to make. It shows you the *proportions of time learners spend online*, with the *teacher present*, and as a class, *group or individual*.

![](charts.png)


Two friends of mine designed an even more powerful tool. It’s a spreadsheet you can easily share with your colleague to design your teaching. 

## Slide 9
The four Cs

Often referred as [21st century skills](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/21st_century_skills#The_Four_Cs)

"So what should we be teaching? Many pedagogical experts argue that schools should switch to teaching ‘the four Cs’ – critical thinking, communication, collaboration and creativity." (/21 lessons for the 21st century/, Part V: Resilience, EDUCATION)

What are the four Cs?
* critical thinking,
* communication,
* collaboration
* creativity

These are the skills every student needs to deal with a world constantly changing.

### Values of the school

> Through a rigorous, bilingual programme and innovative methods, we educate pupils to become responsible, *creative*, and principled global citizens. We teach them to *think critically* and act ethically, to form and express their own opinions and respect those of others, to define their own life goals, and to make sense of and *embrace change*.  

I think that remote learning was a great opportunity to develop these skills.

> The highest level of learning according to Bloom’s Taxonomy is the ability for learners to create. Instead of thinking that the end of a course needs a final exam, we should seek instead to allow opportunities for learners to create something new with the knowledge that was given.  (article ci-dessus)
