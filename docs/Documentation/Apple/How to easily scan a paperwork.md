A lot of students are going to send photos of their paper work. But make sure your students, if they want to write by hand and then send you their work by mail or via Classroom, take properly the photo they intend you to assess.

As a matter of fact, to do that, you can download really great apps on the App Store (like [Scanner Pro](https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/scanner-pro-pdf-scanner-app/id333710667)), but unfortunately they are not free. Even [Scanner mini](https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/scanner-mini-scan-pdf-fax/id581365763) is not worth it. Without paying an in-app purchase, the app is almost useless.

So here are my solution and here are some of the recommandations I make.

1. Remind your students to take a picture (in a well-lit room).
2. Tell them to try the very simple built-in iOS scanner to use.
3. Or use Shortcut.

Well, for the first part. The advice is quite obvious but a lot of students tend to forget it. You need light to take a good picture. As you will soon see, needless to ask them to crop the photo. And speaking of the camera, don‚Äôt fire it! Instead, use the built-in OS scanner.

## Scan documents using the Files app

It‚Äôs not an easy one to spot but you can find it in the Files app. Open it. Just press anywhere (preferably in an empty space). A menu appears. Select ‚ÄúScan Documents‚Äù.

Alternatively, you can tap on the three dots on the top left-hand side.

Then place your document in view of the camera.

It automatically locates the edges.

You can scan multiple pages at one time (press `Keep Scan` on the bottom right-hand side). When you save your photos, you are able to store them in a unique file (this is huge!!!). And, of course, don‚Äôt forget to change the title (the auto title is ‚Äúscanned document‚Äù).

The problem is: you are going to get a big file. The quality of the photos are great but the file, consequently, is too heavy. [I love PDF](https://www.ilovepdf.com/) may be the solution.

Choose `Compress PDF`. Select the PDF you want to shrink and follow the steps. Every time, you end up with a file 90% smaller!

## Shortcuts

I love [Shortcuts](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/shortcuts/id915249334).

With this app, you can automate things. [Apple](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/shortcuts/welcome/ios) defines it like this:

> A shortcut is a quick way to get one or more tasks done with your apps. The Shortcuts app lets you create your own shortcuts with multiple steps. For example, build a ‚ÄúSurf Time‚Äù shortcut that grabs the surf report, gives an ETA to the beach and launches your surf music playlist.

We are going to create a shortcut with very few steps. If you don‚Äôt want to build it but only use it, you can [download this one](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/92c6ba91cffb43a8a18fe2d39dd0d405). The purpose of our shortcuts it to 

1. Launch the camera and take photos
2. Make a PDF of these photos
3. Set a name
4. Save the PDF

First, press the + button to create a new shortcut.

On the left column, type ‚ÄúTake photo‚Äù and drag and drop the action (have a look on the next screenshot).

If you have two photos, pick the appropriate number.

Choose `Make PDF`.

Set name and don‚Äôt forget to add `Ask Each Time`.

Choose `Save`. Students will be able to save their documents wherever they want. Even if the shortcut displays iCloud Drive, it will open up Files and one can choose whatever service we want: iCloud, Google Drive, Dropbox and so forth.

You can rename your brand new shortcut. You can change the glyph as well.

If you want to use it, just press Play. Or press the shortcut.

By doing this way, you shouldn‚Äôt have any more dark photos which would need to be cropped. You won‚Äôt have two or three photos but a single file with a proper name. All you have to do is put a grade on it! üòÉ
