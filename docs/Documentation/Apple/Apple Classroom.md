**Apple Classroom** is different from **Google Classroom**. The former is an app that helps you manage student devices; the latter is an LMS (that is to say a [Learning Management System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning_management_system)). If you are not familiar with Google Classroom, I suggest you read the introduction guides.

To give you an example, with Google Classroom, you are going to assign an activity or send a document to your students. While this is possible with Apple Classroom, you‚Äôll want to use it to monitor a student‚Äôs iPad: is the student working? Is he or she playing a game or doing something else?

## Let‚Äôs get started
You don‚Äôt need to create a class. The IT department already did it. So all you have to do is to select your class. You‚Äôll find all your students.

‚ö†Ô∏è In order to work properly, it is required that Bluetooth‚Äôs is on.

While we are at it, I always ask my students that their iPad is on **silent mode**, that **Do not disturb** is on and of course that the **Bluetooth** is on. Thanks to [Shortcuts](https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/shortcuts/id1462947752) all of this can be automated. More on that later.

So you have your classes. Select one of them and you‚Äôll see that you have seven options.

1. Open
2. Navigate 
3. Hide
4. Lock
5. Mute
6. Screens
7. Group

## 1. Open
When selected, you can open an app (say [Books](https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/apple-books/id364709193)) on all the iPads of your class at the same time.

You have one option: `Lock in app after opening`, which means students can‚Äôt do anything else. This aims to help them keep focused.

‚ö†Ô∏è Be careful! Students know a way around this restriction. All they have to do is to restart their iPad. So go check once in a while.

## 2. Navigate 
You can launch a specific webpage. So there is no need to share a URL or display a QR Code. However, to do that, you need to bookmark the page on your own browser.

As above, you can `Lock in app after opening`.

## 3. Hide
The `Hide` button simply does what it says. It hides the app or the website you launched.

## 4. Lock
If you see that a student is not paying attention or is doing something else, you can lock the student‚Äôs iPad.

Don‚Äôt forget to select the locked student iPad and to unlock it when needed. Anyway, the student will remind you or will restart the device.

üí° When you want students to listen, ask them to put their iPad upside down.

## 5. Mute
You can mute an iPad. Of course, this is not necessary because the student would already have done it. üòÉ

## 6. Screens
This is probably my favourite feature of Apple Classroom. It feels a bit like being CCTV but it‚Äôs very convenient. In every class, you know that there are always students who need extra help to keep focused on what we are doing.

‚ö†Ô∏è As you watch, the status bar on the student's iPad will turn blue so he or she knows you're watching.

## 7. Group
Classroom lets you create custom groups within your class. It‚Äôs pretty handy if you want to differentiate and give a specific task to a specific group of students.

Just tap the Group button, select a group of students, then name the group.

## There‚Äôs more
Even if you don‚Äôt see it when you open up Apple Classroom, you still have some interesting features.

### Be notified if students exchange docs
The first I‚Äôd like to mention is that when a student send something to another student using AirDrop, you are notified and you can see which document has been unduly sent. I can assure you that it may be funny.

### Share document
This is not a hidden feature properly speaking. It‚Äôs rather an invisible one because it relies on drag & drop. So here‚Äôs the thing: you can share files with your students (spreadsheets, presentations, videos, anything you want).

1. Swipe up from the bottom of your screen to bring up the dock. Touch and hold the Files app to see recent documents. Then drag one of them to one or several students.
2. Or, if you prefer, use [split view](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT207582) and then drag and drop your doc from one app to another.
4. Tell your students to accept the document you are sharing.

###  Share student work
Thanks to a projector and an Apple TV, it can be very useful to display a student‚Äôs screen.

1. Select your student.
2. Select AirPlay to project a student‚Äôs screen.
3. Select the appropriate Apple TV from the list.

### Summary
The last feature is the report you end up with when the class is over. It‚Äôs a summary of everything that has been done during your student‚Äôs activities.
