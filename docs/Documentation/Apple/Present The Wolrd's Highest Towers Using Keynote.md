## Create your presentation
Open up Keynote and choose a theme.

![[0F29B943-5552-441E-889F-079DDF404B7E.png | 500]]

Pick a basic one ("Basic White" for instance).

![[7A440004-A083-460F-B0CB-840047EADEAF.png | 500]]

Get rid of the text or delete the slide and create an empty one.

![[1F3E400A-8B92-46F3-8B56-A6E59168B643.png | 500]]

## Create your planet
On the little brush on the top right corner, select `Background` and change it to blue.

![[60B4C8EE-7E6F-4753-B214-DF58F32C93ED.png | 500]]

![[FDEE1724-EB65-43A9-9F65-CA9A614EBDFF.png | 500]]

Tap on the + button, add a shape (`Basic`). Pick a square. Make it black.

![[D117198C-BFA8-4E66-84B5-868CECE8DA21.png | 500]]

Fill the slide with this square so it covers the entire blue slide. Center it.

![[D9AEDF60-DBE1-42FF-B2C7-FBDAA7EF14D1.png | 500]]

Add a new shape but a circle this time.

Make it white so you can see it (tap on the brush and change the colour).

![[5820468F-4044-422D-8C2B-DECF632CDC94.png | 500]]

Set the size (around 400 to 500pt) and center it.

Now select both the black square and the white circle (first select the circle, without removing your finger, keep holding, select the black square). Go to `Arrange` and combine the two shapes by selecting the last icon (or the one before for that matter).

![[42C11B82-2B0F-4920-A504-FA008970BB7F.png | 500]]

![[DB794BEC-2A05-48D6-A2D5-EF95B42DACDC.png | 500]]

Now decrease the size of your slide and get rid of the formatting option
Move your square which now has a hole.

![[682502E8-BD0C-4C8D-8D78-FE2B4BFB0628.png | 500]]

## Add a map
Create the map using Shapes (tap the + button) and choose `Places`.

![[A4C768D4-3C61-40F9-BCC7-A01ABCCF855C.png | 500]]

Increase its size, change the colour to green (select your shape, go to `Style` in the "brush").

![[278EAF92-2A81-4958-8B21-8A719DB3DA10.png | 500]]

Tap the shape. A menu appears. Make a copy. Place it next to the first one, side by side.

![[558B86AC-B3CB-4439-84EF-AF721AB38441.png | 500]]

Select both. In the menu, select `Group`. You now have one only shape.

![[200140E9-748A-450B-8083-DB273C34F30E.png | 500]]

Move it to the left.

![[BD37DA8F-2719-42BB-8478-444C9DE7C5ED.png | 500]]

Put back the black shape with the hole.

Go to `Arrange` > Move it to the front.

## Animate it
Select your slide. A menu appears. Tap `Transition`.

![[B9A98A22-33A7-495B-8535-D544C4FE24B8.png | 500]]

Add a transition. Pick `Magic Move`. Wait a little bit.

![[C042806E-02FC-4E35-9AA9-02B83E4FB2D2.png | 500]]

Tap Done and duplicate the slide.

![[797030E3-2685-48A5-BBE5-BFF2E8E0229A.png | 500]]

On the second slide, move your map to the right.

![[394038EE-884D-491C-B808-FDA631323B07.png | 500]]

![[B8ABB5A7-35E4-4B54-8F98-7DB14474DB62.png | 500]]

Go back to the first slide, make the menu appears by tapping it.

Tap on `Magic Move` and set the duration to 10/15s approximatively.

![[8C534845-ADD3-4F68-9CBF-B9B0B200063C.png | 500]]

Now, when the animation is played, you will have the illusion that the hearth is spinning (but in fact, it's just Magic Move! The maps just move from the left to the right behind the black shape with the hole). Nice, isn't it?

## Title & Menu
Insert a title by tapping the + button. Go to `Shapes` > `Basic` > `Text`.

![[61B7D7E1-5119-41B2-8528-9CD96C747584.png | 500]]

Style the text. Make it fit on one line.

![[53A5441E-3216-4E27-AF29-B0A33E372D19.png | 500]]

Create a green rectangle.
Insert text, style it (bold, 43 pt).
Group the rectangle and the text (remember how to do that?).
Duplicate five time on one side, five time on the other.

![[88BD9AF8-9A28-4FA1-AB23-2AE70640B44B.png | 500]]

![[C18F2BDE-1D7B-403C-80CB-2C036DDB6EB3.png | 500]]

Use the yellow lines to adjust the position.

Change the names.

![[2B27C786-1861-4BB4-AFDF-131957C9D0A0.png | 500]]

Select all the names and green rectangles at once and copy and paste them in the second slide.

Copy the title too.

![[C9494BF4-E22F-4F86-813F-2E9215581E27.png | 500]]

## Slides & Towers
Now duplicate the first slide (it becomes the third slide).

![[68C59118-B01D-4DD6-96DD-2D3F265B5ACA.png | 500]]

Delete the transition (just tap the slide, select `Transition` and delete it).

Place the map where you want your first tower to appear (let's say United States for the Empire State Building).

Place the tower.

Insert a text box for location, height and opening.

![[6E4F4B9A-2CB7-4338-92BA-1EBE13D7002B.png | 500]]

## Animate your objects
Now we are going to animate our tower, our text, the map and even our button.

First, animate the map. Select it. In the menu, choose `Animate` and pick `Move In`.

![[AAF17410-B6E5-4109-86FA-C3F0CA8ADF28.png | 500]]

![[BB39837D-DC03-48C2-B57F-EBC0490F68E1.png | 500]]

Close the menu. Tap on the name of the animation, remove the effect `Bounce on`, set the duration to 5s.

![[E0345F04-722A-413D-B859-685E699BB042.png | 500]]

Animate the tower (select it and chose `Pop`).

![[894ECD61-70BA-46CA-8419-70A5EEA0D7BB.png | 500]]

Do the same with the text down below.

Now, let's take care of our buttons.

To indicate the state of a button, change the colour to red. It means that it has been clicked. It becomes the active button.

![[1D3D2013-E588-4C6D-9835-5AA9D62B90B9.png | 500]]

Now, simply tell Keynote how we want all of these animations to appear. We are going to choose `After transition` (so the tower pop up after the animated map).

![[A110D503-64EC-45B0-8AF4-BB446777ED1C.png | 500]]

To do that, just select the first item (say the map). In the menu, pick `Animation`. In the upper right corner, tap on the three lines next to `Done`.
Choose `After Transition` so the animation starts automatically after the transition.

Select the second item (the tower). Set it to `After Build 1`.

![[12A4D5EA-5EE7-4EA7-8A2A-0E77C81AB2B6.png | 500]]

Do the same for the location, height, etc.

Tap Done.

By the way, let's animate the title on the first slide (`Pop`) and make it play automatically.

![[C5C55859-41B4-411B-92F8-760A7B6D665C.png | 500]]

Do the same with the transition.

Repeat for all the towers (be brave)! Do remember it will involve now a lot of copy and paste.

## Links
To make it a little bit more interactive, we are going make our buttons clickable. So when you click on Empire State Building, for instance, it leads us to the slide with this tower (ie the third slide).

Simply tap on the green rectangle. In the menu, pick `Link` and link the rectangle to the third slide.

![[3460D370-AADD-4C55-8163-24263562FE5C.png | 500]]

![[C981C4B1-9F28-4A64-ACA3-D52CD775ADBD.png | 500]]

## The last slide
To finish, just create a slide and insert a table so everyone can find where you downloaded the images and found the information about the towers.

You will have to change the background to black.

Insert a table by taping the + button and choose the table you want.

I just removed the header and the footer but it's completely up to you.

No table outline, etc.

![[7665AFF3-85C8-4BF2-8C81-B2087C7EBE59.png | 500]]

Copy and paste the tower's names and the link.
