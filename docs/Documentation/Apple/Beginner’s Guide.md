## 1Ô∏è. Unboxing

You may start [a YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=ipad+unboxing) if you want to. üòÑ 

If this is the first time you get an iPad, take some time to explore it. You can also read or watch these guides:

- [Beginner's Guide: How to set up and get started with your new iPad, iPad mini, iPad Air, or iPad Pro](https://www.imore.com/beginners-guide-how-set-and-get-started-your-new-ipad-or-ipad-pro)

‚úâÔ∏è If you need help, feel free to ask. I‚Äôll be more than happy to help.

## 2Ô∏è. Google Account

First things first, let‚Äôs connect to your Google Account on your iPad. From there, you will be able to use the G Suite but also Zoom.

If this is the first time you connect to your Google Account, the process will be slightly different but if not you‚Äôll need to grant access to your iPad with a second device (that is called [two step authentication](https://www.google.com/landing/2step/)).

## 3Ô∏è. Apple ID

While this is not mandatory, I suggest you create an Apple ID. You will be able to download some apps, you‚Äôll be able to locate remotely your iPad if you lost it, etc.

As you will see from here, the two-step authentication is already enabled.

## 4Ô∏è. Self Service

Since our iPads are managed devices through a MDM, we can deploy automatically some apps. You may also download them in an app called Self Service.
