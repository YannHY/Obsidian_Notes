## iPad OS 15
[You can place multiple copies of the same app on your home screen with iOS 15](https://9to5mac.com/2021/06/08/you-can-place-multiple-copies-of-the-same-app-on-your-home-screen-with-ios-15/)
 
> To make a copy of an app, you need to use drag and drop. 
> One way to do this is with the App Library. With an app already placed on your home screens, go to the App Library, locate the same application and long-press to drag it. You can then place it onto a home screen and your existing icon will not be removed. 
> iOS 15 also enables drag-and-drop for apps in Spotlight search. So you can skip the App Library and directly search for your app, then drag it out of Spotlight and place it where you want it.

### Focus
The Do not disturb settings are now called Focus.

In Control Center, 3 options (3 Focus modes):
- Do not disturb
- Personal
- Work

You can create your own Focus mode (press the + button)

> Here’s how you should think about Focus: it’s both a revamp of the standard Do Not Disturb and Do Not Disturb-like modes of iOS and iPadOS with more consistent settings, and it’s also a way to create a custom Do Not Disturb mode that fits your needs at different times of the day. At a high level, the core idea behind Focus is the same as Do Not Disturb, but more fleshed out: when you want to, well, _focus_ on particular aspects of your work or personal life, you can enable a Focus to silence notifications from specific apps or people, trigger automations in Shortcuts, and even rearrange your Home Screens. Focus is Do Not Disturb on steroids, and I believe its flexibility and customizable design will appeal to all kinds of users later this year.
