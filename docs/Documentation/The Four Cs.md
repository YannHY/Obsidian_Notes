## 21 lessons for the 21st century
I was reading *21 lessons for the 21st century* from Yuval Noah Harari, the author of *Sapiens*. In one chapter, he’s talking about education and says that in a world “==flooded by enormous amounts of information==”, “the last thing a teacher needs to give her pupils is more information”.

> So what should we be teaching? Many pedagogical experts argue that schools should switch to teaching ‘the four Cs’  […].  

The four Cs are:
1. *critical thinking*,
2. *communication*,
3. *collaboration*,
4. *creativity*

## An Educator’s Guide to the Four Cs

Franklin D. Roosevelt once said, “==We cannot build the future for our youth—but we can build our youth for the future==.”

> [...] teaching the core content subjects—math, social studies, the arts must be enhanced by incorporating critical thinking, communication, collaboration, and creativity.

America’s system of education was built for an economy and a society that no longer exists. In the manufacturing and agrarian economies that existed 50 years ago, it was enough to master the “==Three Rs==” (*reading*, *writing*, and *arithmetic*). In the modern “flat world,” the “==Three Rs” simply aren’t enough==. If today’s students want to compete in this global society, however, they must also be proficient communicators, creators, critical thinkers, and collaborators (the “Four Cs”).

Students need to master additional subject areas, including foreign languages, the arts, geography, science, and social studies. Educators must complement all of those subjects with the “Four Cs” to prepare young people for citizenship and the global workforce.

Life today is exponentially more complicated and complex than it was 50 years ago. [...] In the 21st century, citizenship requires levels of information and technological literacy that go far beyond the basic knowledge that was sufficient in the past.

==Global warming, immigration reform, pandemic diseases, and financial meltdowns are just a few of the issues today’s students will be called upon to address. Today’s students must be prepared to solve these challenges.== (➝ Étonnant. Ces lignes ont été écrites en 2011 ou 2021 ?)

Additionally, 80 percent of executives believe ==fusing the “Three Rs” and “Four Cs”== would ensure that students are better prepared to enter the workforce.

While critical thinking and problem solving used to be the domain of gifted students, now it’s a critical domain for every student.

[...] the most desirable jobs—the ones least likely to be automated or outsourced—are those that require expert thinking and complex communication.

Many educators have come to realize that they must engage in more problem- and project-based learning if they are to embed the “Four Cs” into their classroom practices.

Consider creating a book club or literature study group around 21st Century Skills reading.

### Frequently Asked Questions
*How will the “Four Cs” impact curriculum and instruction?*
➝ Educators must reflect on what changes are required as the Common Core standards and the AP exams ==deemphasize memorization and more strongly emphasize critical thinking and problem solving==.

*You want us to focus on the “Four Cs,” but what about topics like global competence, financial literacy, and environmental literacy?*
➝ These additional topics are very important. In fact, some schools and districts have adopted them in addition to the “Four Cs.” ==Educators must also contemplate teaching the “Four Cs” in the context of these subjects.==

*How can technology help support the “Four Cs”?*
➝ Technology has a crucial role to play in mastering the “Four Cs.” ==While critical thinking, collaboration, communication, and creativity can all be taught in a low-tech environment, 21st century students need to harness technology to be effective problem solvers, collaborators, communicators, and creators. They must use technology to collaborate with others in communities beyond their own.==

## Critical thinking
- Use various types of reasoning (*inductive*, *deductive*, etc.) as appropriate to the situation.
- *Analyze* how parts of a whole interact with each other to produce overall outcomes in complex systems
- Effectively *analyze and evaluate* evidence, arguments, claims, and beliefs
- Analyze and evaluate major alternative points of view
- *Synthesize* and *make connections* between information and arguments
- *Interpret information* and *draw conclusions* based on the best analysis
- *Reflect critically* on learning experiences and processes
- *Solve* different kinds of unfamiliar problems in both conventional and innovative ways
- *Identify* and ask significant questions that *clarify* various points of view and *lead to better solutions*

## Communication
- *Articulate thoughts and ideas effectively* using oral, written, and nonverbal communication skills in a variety of forms and contexts
- *Listen effectively to decipher meaning*, including knowledge, values, attitudes, and intentions
- *Use communication for a range of purposes* (e.g. to inform, instruct, motivate, and persuade)
- *Use multiple media and technologies*, and know how to assess impact and their effectiveness a priori
- Communicate effectively *in diverse environments* (including multilingual and multicultural)

## collaboration
- Demonstrate ability to *work effectively and respectfully with diverse teams*
- Exercise *flexibility* and *willingness* to be *helpful* in making necessary *compromises* to accomplish a common goal
- *Assume shared responsibility* for collaborative work, and *value the individual contributions* made by each team member

## Creativity
> In a world enriched by abundance but disrupted by the automation and outsourcing of white-collar work, everyone must cultivate an artistic sensibility. We may not all be Dali or Degas. But today we must all be designers. (Daniel Pink)  

- Use a *wide range of idea creation techniques* (such as brainstorming)
- Create new and worthwhile ideas (both incremental and radical concepts)
- Elaborate, refine, analyze, and evaluate original ideas to improve and maximize creative efforts
- Develop, implement, and communicate new ideas to others effectively
- *Be open and responsive* to new and diverse perspectives; incorporate group input and feedback into the work
- Demonstrate originality and inventiveness in work and understand the real world limits to adopting new ideas
- *View failure as an opportunity to learn*; understand that creativity and innovation are part of a long-term, cyclical process of small successes and frequent mistakes
- Act on creative ideas to make a tangible and useful contribution to the field in which the innovation will occur
