## SAMR Model: A Practical Guide for EdTech Integration
The  [SAMR Model](http://www.emergingedtech.com/2015/04/examples-of-transforming-lessons-through-samr/)  is a framework created by Dr. Ruben Puentedura that categorizes ==four different degrees of classroom technology integration==. The letters "SAMR" stand for ==Substitution, Augmentation, Modification, and Redefinition==.

### Substitution
At this stage, technology is directly substituted for a more traditional one. It is a simple, bare-bones, direct replacement. For example, if you are teaching a government lesson on the Constitution, *you might use an electronic or web-based version of the document instead of a hard copy*. Students might also answer questions about the Constitution using a Microsoft Word instead of filling out a worksheet.

Substitution *might also include a student using Keynote, PowerPoint, Prezi, Slides*, or a similar program to present information about an article or amendment to the class.

In this step, you ask yourself  what we stand to gain by replacing traditional tools with technology. Invariably, some situations will be better served with pen and paper.

### Augmentation
The technology is again directly substituted for a traditional one, but with significant enhancements to the student experience. In other words, you ask yourself if the technology increases or augments a student's productivity and potential in some way.

Returning to the Constitution example, a student might *augment a presentation on, say, the 14th Amendment with a video clip* of how equal protection under the law was enforced during school desegregation. *It could also include interactive links* to relevant supreme court decisions, such as Plessy v. Ferguson or Brown v. Topeka Board of Education.

### Modification
In this stage, you are beginning to move from enhancement to transformation on the model. Instead of replacement or enhancement, this is an actual change to the design of the lesson and its learning outcome. The key question here—does the technology significantly alter the task?

A student presenting research on the 14th Amendment, to continue our example, might *create his or her own unique graphic organizer* for the class that not only includes the usual multimedia resources but represents a new product or synthesis of existing material. As another example, a group of students might *collaborate in a cloud-based workspace* to propose a modern definition of equal protection under the law and solicit feedback on their proposals from classmates.

### Redefinition
The last stage of the SAMR model is Redefinition and *represents the pinnacle of how technology can transform a student’s experience*. In this case, you ask yourself if the technology tools allow educators to redefine a traditional task in a way that would not be possible without the tech, creating a novel experience.

For example, after completing their group work and soliciting feedback from classmates (both tasks that could be completed "offline" although arguably not with the same experience as in the modified format), students could *utilize technology to network with students several states away* to see how regional differences impact how others think about the Constitution.

Taking it a step further, *students could even interact in real time with citizens in another country* to examine key differences in constitutional philosophy and law. This can bridge the gap between K-12 and higher education as it did in  [this digital citizenship project](https://www.schoology.com/blog/using-digital-citizenship-bridge-gap-between-higher-ed-and-k-12) .

## SAMR and Bloom’s Taxonomy
[[Bloom’s Taxonomy]]

Many educators use the SAMR model and  [Bloom’s Taxonomy](https://cft.vanderbilt.edu/guides-sub-pages/blooms-taxonomy/)  in tandem to make their technology integration more purposeful. *It’s a common mistake*, however, to conflate the two models and think that deeper technology integration (the M and R in SAMR) lead to higher order thinking skills defined by Bloom. This is simply not the case.

So while it may be useful to use SAMR and Bloom’s Taxonomy to better flesh out your instructional strategy, keep in mind that they were designed for very different purposes.

Le modèle SAMR est l’occasion de se demander pourquoi on utilise la technologie. Dans le cas d’une simple substitution, ce n’est peut-être tout simplement pas utile.
