As a school principal in Spain said:

> We are using digital technologies for many years, but we have not had a proper evaluation of how we are doing, our weaknesses, and what the students think about technology use at our school. Through SELFIE, we know that we can improve things like data protection, safer use of the internet, and social networks. We also need to boost the confidence of teachers with more training and support in using technology.

If you would like to know how it works, please have a look at [How SELFIE works](https://ec.europa.eu/education/schools-go-digital/how-selfie-works_en).

![](selfie-for-teachers.png)

It uses questionnaires to collect the views of school leaders, teachers and students, on an anonymous and voluntary basis, and compiles the results in an interactive report that can identify strengths and weaknesses. SELFIE can be taken every year to enable a school to monitor its progress over time and can be taken up to three times during any one academic year.

There are three questionnaires, one for each of the three user groups: school leaders, teachers and students.

<hr />

Each school can set up the questions to suit its needs, choosing from optional statements and adding its own questions. Once students, teachers and school leaders have replied, the school receives a custom report with data and insights. These findings can help a school see what is working well and less well, and identify areas where action is needed (for instance whether teachers are satisfied with the training they receive; what part of the infrastructure students would want to improve; whether the school has a vision for how it wants to use technology and, if so, whether this has been communicated to staff and students).

All responses to SELFIE are anonymous, and no personal data is collected. The data will not be used to rank schools or education systems.

It helps teachers and students discuss how best to use new technologies in teaching and learning, and boost their digital skills. Schools can take stock of where they are at on their digital journey and set their future course.

<hr />

Participation should be on a voluntary basis and will be anonymous.

Users do not need to login to SELFIE and do not require a username or password. The links can be copied and distributed by email or by being published, for example, on the school‚Äôs shared drive.

It is recommended that younger students complete the questionnaires as a whole class activity with a teacher.

Once the survey has been submitted, a Get Participation Certificate link will appear. Clicking on this will open a printable certificate signed by European Commission, which the user can personalise, if he or she wishes to do so, by adding his or her name.

The name entered is NOT stored as participation in SELFIE is anonymous. Please remind staff and students that certificates cannot be generated at a later date as no data on individual users is stored.

### Premier mail
Good afternoon everyone,

I will invite you soon to take part in a survey which involves the whole school (primary, lower secondary, upper secondary, teachers, students, school leaders...).

This survey is called [SELFIE](https://ec.europa.eu/education/schools-go-digital).

SELFIE is the European Commission's free online tool that helps schools assess and improve the ways they use technology for teaching and learning. It stands for *Self-reflection on Effective Learning by Fostering Innovation through Educational technology*.

SELFIE anonymously gathers the views of students, teachers and school leaders on how technology is used in their school. Almost all questions are answered on a five-point scale with 1 the lowest rating and 5 the highest. Based on this input, the tool generates a report, a snapshot (a "SELFIE" ) of a school‚Äòs strengths and weaknesses in their use of technology.

It can help a school see what is working well and less well, and identify areas where action is needed (for instance whether teachers are satisfied with the training they receive; what part of the infrastructure students would want to improve; whether the school has a vision for how it wants to use technology).

I will keep you inform and will provide you with some more details as soon as possible, but I want to thank you for your participation.

### Deuxi√®me mail
The survey is almost ready. So let me explain a little bit more about SELFIE. 

As you may know, SELFIE is a tool to help schools realise where they stand in their use of digital technologies. It offers a way of taking a ‚Äúselfie‚Äù of our school by looking at different areas: school strategies, teaching, infrastructure, curriculum and experience of students.

To do that, a survey must be completed. Whether you are a teacher, a student or a school leader, you are expected to answer a series of questions. While participation is on a voluntary basis and will be anonymous, you understand that the more answers we get, the more accurate the report will be.

Regarding students participation, it is recommended that they complete the questionnaires as a whole class activity with a teacher. So, I would like CTL to take a little bit of time to take this survey with their students. By doing so, the teacher can explain to students what is SELFIE, why they are answering these questions and help them if necessary.

It takes around 20 minutes for students and 40 for teachers and school leaders.

You will have three weeks. Participants will no longer be able to answer or access the questions after the closing date.

### Troisi√®me mail
The surveys are now ready to be filled. There are three questionnaires, one for each of the three user groups: school leaders, teachers and students. 

üîó Please find the *links*:

- Lower secondary:
- Upper secondary:
- Primary:

‚ö†Ô∏è The questionnaire is available from ‚Ä¶ to the ‚Ä¶.

Remember that most of the SELFIE questions are answered on a five-point scale (including any questions you create for your school):

1. Strongly disagree
2. Disagree
3. Slightly agree
4. Agree
5. Strongly agree

### There are six areas:
1. Leadership
2. Infrastructure and Equipment
3. Continuing Professional Development
4. Teaching and Learning
5. Assessment Practices
6. Student‚Äôs Digital Competences

### Examples of questions you will have to answer:
1. In our school, the digital *infrastructure* supports teaching and learning with digital technologies
2. In our school, there are *digital devices for me to use for teaching*
3. In our school, there is *access to the internet* for teaching and learning
4. In our school,*technical support* is available in case of problems with digital technologies
5. In our school, there are *data protection* systems in place
6. In our school, there are school-owned/managed *digital devices for students to use* when they need them

Users do not need to login to SELFIE and do not require a username or password.

Once the survey has been submitted, a *Get Participation Certificate* link will appear. Clicking on this will open a printable certificate signed by European Commission, which the user can personalise, if he or she wishes to do so, by adding his or her name.

The name entered is NOT stored as participation in SELFIE is anonymous. Please bear in mind that certificates cannot be generated at a later date as no data on individual users is stored.

<hr />

Any school that has participated in SELFIE has the opportunity to obtain an open digital badge. Open badges are tokens of recognition or accomplishment issued online by organisations usually to reward an individual‚Äôs achievements. The SELFIE open badge however is a badge for schools; it is school specific and can be used on the school‚Äôs blog, websites, and social media applications or within the school email signature. It will display the school name or the short form of the school name if it has been entered in the school profile.
