> ## Personal data processing  
> The legal entity behind Exam.net is Teachiq AB, a limited company registered in Sweden. Sweden is a member of the European Union (EU), and therefore the General Data Protection Regulation, GDPR, has applied to Swedish companies since May 2018. The GDPR regulates personal data processing and applies to all legal or personal entities, public authorities, agencies or other bodies that process personal data in the EU. The Exam.net team works continuously on structure, clarity and safety to ensure that we collect and process personal data in a way that is compliant with the data protection regulation.

> ## Personal data on Exam.net  
> An entity is either a data controller or a data processor. A data controller determines the purposes and means of the processing and a data processor is any entity that processes personal data on behalf of a data controller. Exam.net is a data processor when teachers use the tool in their profession and when students are invited to use the tool by their teacher.  
> We collect and process personal data in order to deliver a safe and secure service, and to fulfil our duties towards our users according to agreement. Examples on personal data we process are name, e-mail and IP address, school, subject, class and student ID along with answers and comments made in tests and exams. Exam.net does not collect sensitive personal data such as data on health, sexual orientation or religious beliefs.  
> Exam.net is a modern product with privacy by design. The platform is built to ensure that our systems are safe and well protected, so that we can safeguard the personal data that we process. We continuously work to improve our processes, routines and our documentation.  
> Should you have any questions about how Exam.net works with GDPR, please feel free to contact us on privacy@exam.net.
