At some point, Kahn explains that thanks to videos teachers are kind of obsolete.
 
 "They (his cousin) told me that they preferred me on YouTube than in person" -> laughter
 
 "they can cause and repeat their cousin without feeling like tey're wasting my time"
 
 "they can watch at their own time and pace"
 
 "Probably the least-appreciated aspect of this is the notion that the very first time that you're trying to get your brain around a new concept, the very last thing you need is another human being saying "Do you understand this?""
 
 Boasting about the variety of the audience (a boy with autism, young people enjoying math for the very first time)...
 
 Teachers want to use videos to flip the classroom.
 
 "What I do is assign the lectures for homework, and what used to be homework, I know have the students doing in the classroom."
 
 "this is the unintuitive thing when you talk about technology in the classroom. By removing the one-size-fits-all lecture from the classroom and letting students have a self-paced lecture at home, and then we you go to the classroom, letting them to work, having the teacher walk around, having the peers actually be able to interact with each other, these teachers have used technology to humanize the classroom. They took a fundamentally dehumanizing experience — a bunch of 30 kids with their fingers on their lips, not allowed to interact with each other"
 
 Explains what is the Kahn Academy...
 
 "our goal is to use technology to humanize, not just in Los Altos, but on a global scale, what's happening in education"
 
 "what you'll see emerging is this notion of a global one-world classroom"
 
 Bill Gates' conclusion: "Well, it's amazing. I think you just got a glimpse of the future of education"

## Extrait de *Failure to Disrupt*

> Millions of people have watched Khan’s two TED talks, but I suspect that far fewer have read his 2019 interview with District Administration, a trade magazine for school superintendents and central office staff. “Now that I run a school,” he told the interviewer, “I see that some of the stuff is not as easy to accomplish compared to how it sounds theoretically.” ==Khan’s recommendations in 2019 focused less on disruptive transformations of math education and more on using Khan Academy as a modest supplement to traditional classroom instruction==: “More recently, we’re seeing that if students put 30 minutes to an hour per week—or one class period per week—toward software-based, self-paced learning, schools will see a 20 to 30 percent greater-than-expected gain on state assessments. That’s exciting because that’s a dosage that’s very doable in mainstream classrooms. We tell schools to give students 30 to 60 minutes of Khan Academy per week, with teachers doing traditional curriculum four days per week.” ==When Khan’s soaring vision met the complex reality of schools, disruption and transformation gave way to accommodation.==
> The blended model that Khan espoused in District Administration is actually at least twenty-five years old. In 1997, Ken Koedinger and colleagues published “Intelligent Tutoring Goes to the Big City,” a report describing the use of adaptive, self-paced algebra tutoring software in the Pittsburgh public schools. Students learned in traditional settings for most of their class time and then spent about one day a week using math tutoring software, which led to improvements on math tests similar to what Khan would find decades later. ==Much of what Khan Academy discovered by 2019 about computer-assisted math instruction, after more than $100 million in philanthropic investment, could have been found in academic papers published in the 1990s.==

## Extrait de Teaching Machine
> There’s at least one problem with the way Khan tells it: the history is all wrong.

> Despite Khan’s claim in his TED Talk that to “use video to reinvent education” is a novel idea, classrooms have been using film for over one hundred years.

## The Oneworld Schoolhouse: Education reimagined
### Art & science
> I passionately believe that the Khan Academy is a tool that can empower at least an approximate model of what the future of education should look like—a way of ==combining the art of teaching with the science of presenting information and analyzing data==, of delivering the clearest, most comprehensive, and most relevant curriculum at the lowest possible cost.

> I believed, and still believe, that ==teaching is a separate skill—in fact, an art== that is creative, intuitive, and highly personal. But it isn’t only an art. ==It has, or should have, some of the rigor of science as well==. I felt that I could experiment with different techniques to see what worked and what didn’t [...]

### Méthode 
> I wanted to be a tutor who genuinely shared his thinking and expressed it in ==a conversational style==, as if I was speaking to an equal who was fundamentally smart but just didn’t fully understand the material at hand.

> Unfortunately, however, the idea that smaller classes alone will magically solve the problem of students being left behind is a fallacy.
> It ignores several basic facts about how people actually learn. ==People learn at different rates==. Some people seem to catch on to things in quick bursts of intuition; others grunt and grind their way toward comprehension.

> ==From the teacher’s perspective, what’s going on is a helping relationship; but from the student’s point of view, it’s difficult if not impossible to avoid an element of confrontation==. A question is asked; an answer is expected immediately; that brings pressure. The student doesn’t want to disappoint the teacher. She fears she will be judged. And all these factors interfere with the student’s ability to fully concentrate on the matter at hand. Even more, students are embarrassed to communicate what they do and do not understand.

About the use of the blackboard:

> What better way, graphically, to suggest this than by showing problems and solutions seeming to emerge from the void? ==Knowledge brought light out of darkness==.

> If attention lasted ten or ==fifteen minutes==, why did it remain a given that class periods were an hour?

> It was partly for this reason — and not because of some preexisting theory — that I decided that I would never be pictured in the lessons. I didn’t at the time own a suitable video camera, and I didn’t want to buy one. It seemed like a slippery slope. If I had a camera, I would have to worry about the lighting. If I had good lighting, I would have to give thought to what I was wearing and whether I had spinach in my teeth. ==The danger was that the whole process would become more like making movies than tutoring students==. ==Tutoring is intimate==. You talk with someone, not at someone. I wanted students to feel like they were sitting next to me at the kitchen table, elbow to elbow, working out problems together. I didn’t want to appear as a talking head at a blackboard, lecturing from across the room. So it was determined that students would never see me but only hear my voice, while the visuals would be nothing except my scrawls (and occasional historic images) on the black electronic chalkboard.

> So if faces are so important to human beings, why exclude them from videos? Because they are a powerful distraction from the concepts being discussed. [...] ==Put a face in the same frame as an equation, and the eye will bounce back and forth between the two==.

In a traditional classroom, expectations of teachers are far too low. A student could pass with 70 percent (which meant there was almost one-third of the material that you didn't know).
Ten right answers in a row are expected:

> My reasoning was that if students could correctly solve ten consecutive problems on a given subject, it was ==a good indication== that they truly understood the underlying concept.

active versus passive learning

The expression "work at his or her own pace" (or "self-paced learning") is often use. Find some examples.

### The Prussian Model
Pour Kahn, notre modèle éducatif a été inventé dans la Prusse du 18e siècle.

> To those not in the field, it may come as a surprise to learn that all these then-radical innovations in what we now call K-12 education were first put in place in eighteenth-century Prussia. Prussia—with its stiff whiskers, stiff hats, and stiff way of marching in lockstep—is where our basic classroom model was invented. Compulsory, tax-supported public education was seen as a political at least as much as a pedagogical tool, and no apology was made for this. The idea was not to produce independent thinkers, but to churn out loyal and tractable citizens who would learn the value of submitting to the authority of parents, teachers, church, and, ultimately, king.

Philosophe prussien à l'origine de ce modèle : Johann Gottlieb Fichte,

En lisant Kahn, on n'est pas loin de la théorie du complot :

> It was not by accident that whole ideas were broken up into fragmented “subjects.” Subjects could be learned by rote memorization, whereas mastering larger ideas called for free and unbridled thinking. Similarly, according to Gatto, our sacred notion of the “class period” was put in place “so that self-motivation to learn would be muted by ceaseless interruptions.”

Mais Kahn ajoute :

> Now, I don’t personally believe that the Prussian system was designed purely as a tool for subjugation to the will of a ruling class.

Et conclut plus loin :

> Today’s world needs a workforce of creative, curious, and self-directed lifelong learners who are capable of conceiving and implementing novel ideas. Unfortunately, this is the type of student that the Prussian model actively suppresses.

L'ensemble reste cependant intéressant et conclut à l'injustice du système : 

> If you didn’t look too closely — if you factored out things like family wealth and political connections and the wherewithal to hire private tutors—the system could pass for a meritocracy.

Il y revient dans un autre chapitre :

> Could people actually learn twice as much as was generally expected of them? It seemed ambitious… but why not? As we saw in the discussion of the Prussian roots of our school system, the original aim of educators was not necessarily to produce the smartest students possible, but to turn out tractable and standardized citizens, workers who knew enough. To this end, attention was given not to what students could learn, but to the bare minimum of what they had to learn. Now, I am not imputing such Machiavellian motives to contemporary educators; but I am suggesting that some of the habits and assumptions that have come down from the eighteenth-century model still steer and limit what students learn. Conventional curricula don’t only tell students where to start; they tell students where to stop. A series of lessons ends; that subject is over. Why aren’t students encouraged to go farther and deeper—to learn twice as much? Probably for the same reason we consider 70 percent a passing grade. Our standards are too low. We’re so squeamish and embarrassed about the very notion of “failure” that we end up diluting and devaluing the idea of success. We limit what students believe they can do by selling short what we expect them to do.
