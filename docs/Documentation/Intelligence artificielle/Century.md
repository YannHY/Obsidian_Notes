[Six ways to use CENTURY in the classroom](https://www.century.tech/news/six-ways-to-use-century-in-the-classroom/)

1. To put learning into practice
2. To immediately address misconceptions
3. As part of a blended learning approach
4. To consolidate prior learning
5. To introduce a new topic
6. To target support 

In a nutshell, students can practice while Century is assessing their understanding and provide instant data to the teacher. If a student need to review the material, content is available at the click of the button. Or you can introduce a new topic. It also help with teacher workload. Century allows you to differentiate and offer personalised pathways that will always be at the right level for each child. It also immediately address misconceptions (through the use of live data). Finally, you can use Century to consolidate prior learning (interesting for spaced repetition or recap).

[How do international schools use CENTURY to support non-native English speakers?](https://www.century.tech/news/how-do-international-schools-use-century-to-support-non-native-english-speakers/)

- To support students transitioning away from ESL lessons
	- assign these learners videos & activities with usual benefits ("students who do not feel comfortable speaking up in class if they struggle with the subject-specific vocabulary")
	- work on language skills independently
- As a pre-learning tool 
	- flipped learning strategy (students are pre-taught certain things before teacher teach a topic. This helps to provide students with the baseline knowledge they need to be successful in lessons)
- To differentiate discreetly 
	- If you know that a child struggled with a particular concept covered in the class, you could ====assign them a nugget on this topic== while other students ==work through their personalised pathway==.
