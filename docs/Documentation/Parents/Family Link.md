If your child is under 13 [^1] and has an Android phone or a Chromebook, you can still monitor your child's device and set different rules thanks to [Family Link](https://families.google.com/familylink/).

Family Link is a service from Google that offers several parental controls.

It doesn't matter if, as a parent, you have an [iPhone](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/google-family-link/id1150085200) or an [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.kids.familylink&referrer=utm_source%3Dfamilylink%26utm_medium%3Dwebsite%26utm_campaign%3Dgetapp). You can download an app available both on the App Store and Google Play and supervise your child usage of an Android device. All you need is a Google Account.

In this tutorial, we won't cover the whole process but you need to know that you can create a Google account for your child using Family Link and manage it. Be aware that you can't use the email provided by the school. The address must be a Gmail account (ending in @gmail.com). 

## What can you do with Family Link?
You can do many things with the Family Link app. For instance, you can control what your child can or cannot download on Google Play depending on your child's age. You can use filters on Google Chrome and block certain websites. You can restrict content on YouTube, etc.

But the features I use the most are the ones down below.

### Screen time
You can check screen time and see how much time your child has spent on his/her device.

![[family-link-apps.png]]
You'll see what apps the child has been using and for how long.

Pick an app to display more details. You can then forbid the use of the app or modify the app permissions (access to the camera, to contacts or to storage, etc.). You can also tap on the little timer to display more options.

Of course, you can exclude apps from time limits you have set.

### Location
Unless the device is offline, you can check the location of the device (it also appears in Google Maps on your device) and find your child when she or he is on the go.

You can also use Family Link to play a sound on a phone you lost so you can find it (scroll down, locate your child's device, press `Settings` or `Play sound`). Note that if the device is lost or has been stolen, you can remotely delete data (in `Device details`, press `Reset device and delete data`).

### Lock or Unlock
You can lock or unlock the device. If you decide that too much time has been spent on the phone, you can simply lock the device. Or you can simply add a bonus time of a few minutes. After that, the device is automatically locked.

### Set limits
You can set a daily limit (say two hours per day) and even schedule bedtime (your child won't be able to use the device after 8 p.m. for instance).
