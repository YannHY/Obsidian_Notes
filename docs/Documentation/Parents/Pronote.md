## Introduction
On Pronote, all usefull information related to your child's school life is available: timetables, notes, reports, communication, absences and more.

## Log in
To access Pronote, you need the credentials [Mr Gamain](dhscoordination@lyceeinternational.london), our DHS coordinator, send to every parent at the beginning of the year.

When you have received your credentials, please click on this link: [https://e044000b.index-education.net/pronote/parent.html](https://e044000b.index-education.net/pronote/parent.html) if your child is in lower or higer school and log in. If your child is in primary, please click there: 1320018c.index-education.net

The very first time, you log in, you are prompted to change the password you have been provided with.

1. Make sure to pick a strong password
2. Ask your browser to store it.

### ðŸ’¡ Tip 1
If you have different account because you have several children, it may be confusing. I suggest you store all your passwords in a password manager app or even a password protected notes on your phone.
If you need help with you login details, please send an email to Mr Gamain.
If you need help with anything related to the browser or your device, please contact the IT department

## The User Interface
### The Home page
The home page is divided in three parts.

1. The first one displays the **timetable**. Click on the little green arrows to change the day.
2. The second one shows the **next assignments**. If your child mark them as `completed`, you can see what is left to be done.
3. The third one provides a list of **useful links**. For instance, you can find the planning of the "Accompagnements personnalisÃ©s" or the "Opening Minds".

As you can see, the first two elements have a little arrow on the upper right corner. These are shortcuts to display the full timetable or the homework notebooks.

### ðŸ’¡ Tip 2
Use the little calendar icon to pick a specific day and find quicker the information you need.

### Contact
Should you want to contact a teacher or anyone working at the school such as the "vie scolaire", the nurse or the head of secondary, click on the envelop located on the upper right corner.

From there, you can either choose to start a new discussion or send an email.

The first option allows you to converse with the person you choose within the application. Whereas picking the email option will automatically launch your default email client app.

Alternatively, you may simply prefer cliking the Communication tab which lead to a page where are gathered every communication maded using Pronote or the discussions held between teachers and you.

## Personal information
When you click on the Personal information tab, you now have four nested options:

1. Account
2. Child's account
3. Parameters
4. Documents to download

There's a lot to say about all this, but keep in mind that:

- You can reset your own password in `Account` or you can even reset your child's password in `Child's account`.
- You can download the reports in `Documents to download`, even the one of the previous years.

## Homework notebooks
As we saw when we explained the disposition of the Home page, you can see what is the work your child has to do.

You can browse by subjects or opt for a `Weekly view`.
