This is a brief introduction to the way students and teachers work at the [Lycée International de Londres](https://www.lyceeinternational.london/).

Both teachers and students have an iPad. And, to make things done, we rely on two main things: G Suite and Pronote.

# iPad

We give our students an iPad. In fact, the iPad belongs to the school and is a pedagogical tool only. This is why games are not accepted. As a matter of fact, iPads are monitored by the IT department and we know what is installed on the device. To do that, we use [Jamf](https://www.jamf.com/), a software for the Apple platform simplifying IT management. For instance, we can buy apps in bulk and push them up on all devices at the same time. Or we can restrict access to some websites or even apps. We may forbid changing this or that settings and so forth.

I will cover security settings in the next session.

For now, I would like to remind you that it is wise to subscribe insurance. It cost £30 a year.

To subscribe to an [insurance](https://lycee.parentportal.biz), you will need to know where to find the serial number of the device. To do that, go to `Settings` > `General` > `About`.

I would also like to highlight the fact that the iPad is a powerful device but it takes time to master it, especially since iOS became iPad OS 13. Moreover, the iPad has a multiplicity of input systems. It is a hybrid machine that can adapt to the context you’re using it: you may use your finger, you may add a Bluetooth keyboard or you may choose the stylus. There is great flexibility which serves different purposes: browse or multitask swiftly, take note, scribble something or even draw, edit a long text document... 

If you need help with any of this, I would be more than happy to help.

# G Suite for Education

This is [a free suite](https://gsuite.google.co.uk/intl/en_uk/) of many software and products developed by Google. You probably know most these applications: Gmail, Docs, Sheets, Slides, and so on.

But you may wondering what is the difference between G Suite for Education and Google's free apps.

First, with G Suite, you'll receive a number of additional services which are not included with Google's free consumer apps.

Secondly, Google states that it “does not collect, scan or use data in G Suite Core Services for advertising purposes” ([Google Cloud Security and Compliance](https://gsuite.google.com/learn-more/security/security-whitepaper/page-6.html)).

Thirdly, data are encrypted. Moreover, it is maybe worth noticing, thanks to G Suite, that we may host our Google accounts in a domain (*@lyceeinternational.london* for instance). In principle, anyone outside this domain is not allowed to view or edit a document.

We may also take into account that students are provided with an unlimited cloud storage space. 

And, last but not least, G Suite is GDPR compliant ([Common questions when considering G Suite](https://gsuite.google.co.uk/intl/en_uk/faq/)).

In the next session, we’ll say a little bit more about the apps we use the most such as Classroom.

# Pronote

The core of our work is done with G Suite. However, when we want you to know what is homework, the grades or the reports, we use Pronote.

If you need help with Pronote, you may send an email to Mr Gamain: dhscoordination@lyceeinternational.london.
