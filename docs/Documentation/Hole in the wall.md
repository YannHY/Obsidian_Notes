## Beyond the Hole in the Wall
[Beyond the Hole in the Wall: Discover the Power of Self-Organized Learning](https://www.amazon.com/Beyond-Hole-Wall-Discover-Self-Organized-ebook/dp/B0070YZSFQ)

### Hétérogénéité & mixité
Idée qu’il faudrait mixer les élèves :

> The most universal and blatantly false of them is that age segregation is a good idea. (propos de Nicholas Negroponte, préface)

On retrouve cette idée chez [[Sal Kahn]] (retrouver référence). Avec cette idée que l’hétérogénéité est source de richesse.

### Usage de la technologie
Réflexion intéressante sur l’usage de la technologie :

> Are LCD projectors, laptops and PowerPoint slides education technology? They weren’t designed as such. Laptops were created for rich company executives, Microsoft wrote PowerPoint for corporate presentations, and LCD projectors were invented for corporate boardrooms. Teachers were convinced to adopt this technology at atrocious prices by salespeople from the corporate world who had discovered a new market in schools.

### Minimally Invasive Education
J’aime bien l’idée “A new idea: ==Minimally Invasive Education==” :

> We had proof of self-regulated learning, and this time we knew that it could happen anywhere in the world, to any child and in any climate. I decided to call the method of instruction we had developed Minimally Invasive Education (MIE). The rest of the world continues to call it the Hole in the Wall.

Lire le chapitre “How Minimally Invasive Education works” pour voir comment le MIE (Minimally Invasive Education) fonctionne. Par exemple :

> Children should use the computer in heterogeneous groups. Since the MIE process depends on exploration and discovery, working in groups is essential. ==Collaborative constructivism is the main paradigm of MIE==. Children teach one another very effectively, and they also are highly capable of self-regulating the process. This is the main reason 100 children can use one computer. 

Et conclusion du chapitre :

> Minimally Invasive Education for children through kid-friendly public Internet kiosks should form an integral part of primary education in the 21st century. It has the potential not only to rapidly close the digital divide but also to unlock the sort of creative potential for children’s self-development that eminent educationists (those who study the theory of education) have sought to inspire for more than a century.

### SOLE
> Emma and I created a ==Self-Organized Learning Environment== (SOLE) in a regular classroom. The children worked in groups of three, four or five, and each group had a computer connected to the Internet. They were allowed to talk with one another and to move around and see what other groups were doing. (Remember, we saw in the Hole in the Wall experiment that clustering around a computer is an effective learning strategy for children.) The children were given selected GCSE questions to work on, and they answered most of them correctly. We then waited two months and tested them again, this time without a computer and with each student taking the test alone — just like a regular examination.

### Learning as emergent phenomena
Chapitre intéressant : ==Learning as emergent phenomena==.

Sugata Mitra tend à expliquer l'**émergence** du savoir comme un phénomène naturel qui se produit dans des conditions particulières :

> When gusts of wind move about, they sometimes come together into a swirling vortex of air. A storm is born. No one coordinated the wind, it just happened.
> A flock of birds will take flight in no particular order. In moments, they form a perfect V as they fly away. No single bird was chosen leader, and no single bird said to make a V. It just happened.
> A beehive of perfect hexagons is made by thousands of bees working together. Bees don’t know anything about geometry or hexagons, and they don’t have a master architect guiding them. They just deposit their wax. The hexagons happen.

Plus loin :

> Self-organization in human networks has been less studied, but collaborative environments, relay chats and digital communities on the Internet seem to indicate that simple rules of connectivity can lead to larger patterns of human behavior.

Relire le dernier chapitre expliquant comment mettre en place la méthode ==ELSE (Emergent Learning Systems in Education)==.

## The Future of Learning
Sur l’insertion d’un ordinateur dans le mur :

> The first question that people will ask you is where to put it. It will get stolen. So I followed the example of the banks. The banks were the only people in those days and even today—one amongst few people—that put computers into public spaces. ATMs.

Voir passages sur la dématérialisation et sur la **comparaison entre la voiture et l'éducation** :

> I want to give you an example of transportation. The horse-drawn cart. This was the main mode of transportation for about a couple thousand years. How did it work? You had the coach, you had the horses, you had the coach man, who generally wore some kind of a hat; and then you had the passengers. You went to the coach man and asked him to take you somewhere. You got into the coach and it went and reached wherever you wanted to go.
> About one hundred years ago, the internal combustion engine got invented and made the horses redundant. We said, “We can now get rid of the horses because we have the internal combustion engine.” Everybody was happy. You can put away the horses, they don’t have to work so hard anymore. We’ll use a combustion engine to do the work instead. But something else happened which we didn´t quite expect: the coach man disappeared. Nobody expected that. While the horses were replaced by engines the coach man disappeared and something really strange happened. The passengers became the drivers. This had not happened before. When that happened all sorts of things started to change, because when passengers became drivers they started to invent some really interesting new developments. All of you know these developments; for example, drunken driving, hitting other people, driving on the wrong side of the road, etcetera, etcetera. The entire legal structure, the infrastructure of roads, traffic lights, policemen, licensing authorities, number plates. The coach man went when all those things came in. Automation, to help the passenger drive.
> [...] The story doesn’t end there. It ends in an even more weird place, because what is happening to the automobile next is something very strange. This year, the first of the actual road trials will begin in the United Kingdom and in the United States. It has been tried for years now: the car that drives itself. The driverless car. You’ll probably see them in two or three years’ time. They’ll probably be quite common.

Et plus loin :

> Now, apply that to education and you are in deep trouble. First of all, you have the teacher leads system—the coach man—where books are the horses. The teacher is the coach man with the passengers in the back. Off we go. Then change to the automobile. The books go away, because they all get interconnected with each other, replaced with the internet. The coach man goes away, because what can the coach man do with the internet? Only the passengers can drive.
> And then take it to the next step. What if it drove itself? What would that mean? In the case of the car it meant that the idea of driving went away. In the case of education, I am left with no choice but to say the idea of learning has to go away. And you’d say, “That’s ridiculous, what do you mean? How can learning go away?” I would go one step further. What about knowing? Could we think of a world where knowing is obsolete? Will there one day be grandchildren who will ask their grandfathers “What does it mean to know something?” The grandfather will say, “In order to know something from a very young age you have to go into large rooms, sit in rows, put your finger on your lips, and listen to a person talking for the next twelve years. Then you’ll know.” That grandchild will say, “Don’t be silly.” So not just things, even concepts, can dematerialize.

Que pensez-vous de cette comparaison entre la voiture et l'éducation ? Avant, un cocher conduisait une voiture à cheval. Puis les chevaux ont disparu avec le moteur à combustion. Puis le cocher. Les passagers sont devenus les conducteurs. Et puis il n'y a plus de conducteur.
