## What Is Bloom’s Taxonomy? A Definition For Teachers
Bloom’s Taxonomy is a *hierarchical ordering of cognitive skills* that can help teachers teach and students learn.

Bloom’s Taxonomy was created by Benjamin Bloom in *1956*.

The *original sequence* of cognitive skills was
- Knowledge,
- Comprehension,
- Application,
- Analysis,
- Synthesis,
- Evaluation

The framework was revised in *2001* by Lorin Anderson and David Krathwohl. The most significant change was the *removal of ‘Synthesis’* and the addition of *‘Creation’*.

There are six levels in Bloom’s Taxonomy. The initialism *RUA2EC* may be useful to recall the levels:

## The 6 Levels of Bloom’s Taxonomy
1. The first level of Bloom’s Taxonomy is to *Remember*.
Example activities at the Remembering level: ==memorize a poem==, ==recall state capitals==, ==remember math formulas==
2. The second level of Bloom’s Taxonomy is to *Understand*.
Example activities at the Understanding level: ==organize the animal kingdom based on a given framework==, ==illustrate the difference between a rectangle and square==, ==summarize the plot of a simple story==
3. The third level of Bloom’s Taxonomy is to *Apply*.
Example activities at the Application level: ==use a formula to solve a problem==, ==select a design to meet a purpose==, ==reconstruct the passage of a new law through a given government/system==
4. The fourth level of Bloom’s Taxonomy is to *Analyze*.
Example activities at the Analysis level: ==identify the ‘parts of’ democracy==, ==explain how the steps of the scientific process work together==, ==identify why a machine isn’t working==
5. The fifth level of Bloom’s Taxonomy is to *Evaluate*.
Example activities at the Evaluation level: ==make a judgment regarding an ethical dilemma==, ==interpret the significance of a given law of physics==, ==illustrate the relative value of a technological innovation in a specific setting—a tool that helps recover topsoil farming==, for example.
6. The sixth and final level of Bloom’s taxonomy is to *Create*.
Example activities at the Creation level: ==design a new solution to an ‘old’ problem that honors/acknowledges the previous failures==, ==delete the least useful arguments in a persuasive essay==, ==write a poem based on a given theme and tone==

## Bloom’s Taxonomy

In 1956, Benjamin Bloom with collaborators Max Englehart, Edward Furst, Walter Hill, and David Krathwohl published *a framework for categorizing educational goals*: Taxonomy of Educational Objectives. Familiarly known as  [Bloom’s Taxonomy](http://teaching.uncc.edu/sites/teaching.uncc.edu/files/media/files/file/GoalsAndObjectives/Bloom.pdf) , this framework has been applied by generations of K-12 teachers and college instructors in their teaching.

The framework consisted of six major categories: Knowledge, Comprehension, Application, Analysis, Synthesis, and Evaluation. The categories after Knowledge were presented as “*skills and abilities*,” with the understanding that *knowledge was the necessary precondition for putting these skills and abilities into practice*.

Each category contained subcategories, all lying along a continuum from simple to complex and concrete to abstract.

## The Original Taxonomy (1956)
Authors’ brief explanations of these main categories from the appendix of /Taxonomy of Educational Objectives/ (/Handbook One/).

- *Knowledge* “involves the recall of specifics and universals, the recall of methods and processes, or the recall of a pattern, structure, or setting.
- *Comprehension* “refers to a type of understanding or apprehension such that the individual knows what is being communicated and can make use of the material or idea being communicated without necessarily relating it to other material or seeing its fullest implications.”
- *Application* refers to the “use of abstractions in particular and concrete situations.”
- *Analysis* represents the “breakdown of a communication into its constituent elements or parts such that the relative hierarchy of ideas is made clear and/or the relations between ideas expressed are made explicit.”
- *Synthesis* involves the “putting together of elements and parts so as to form a whole.”
- *Evaluation* engenders “judgments about the value of material and methods for given purposes.”

## The Revised Taxonomy (2001)
Revision of Bloom’s Taxonomy:  [A Taxonomy for Teaching, Learning, and Assessment](http://acorn.library.vanderbilt.edu/cgi-bin/isbn-search/0321084055) .

The authors of the revised taxonomy underscore this dynamism, *using verbs and gerunds to label their categories and subcategories* (rather than the nouns of the original taxonomy). These “action words” describe *the cognitive processes* by which thinkers encounter and work with knowledge.

- Remember
	- Recognizing
	- Recalling
- Understand
	- Interpreting
	- Exemplifying
	- Classifying
	- Summarizing
	- Inferring
	- Comparing
	- Explaining
- Apply
	- Executing
	- Implementing
- Analyze
	- Differentiating
	- Organizing
	- Attributing
- Evaluate
	- Checking
	- Critiquing
- Create
	- Generating
	- Planning
	- Producing

In the revised taxonomy, *knowledge is at the basis of these six cognitive processes*, but its authors created a separate taxonomy of the types of knowledge used in cognition:

- Factual Knowledge
	- Knowledge of terminology
	- Knowledge of specific details and elements
- Conceptual Knowledge
	- Knowledge of classifications and categories
	- Knowledge of principles and generalizations
	- Knowledge of theories, models, and structures
- Procedural Knowledge
	- Knowledge of subject-specific skills and algorithms
	- Knowledge of subject-specific techniques and methods
	- Knowledge of criteria for determining when to use appropriate procedures
- Metacognitive Knowledge
	- Strategic Knowledge
	- Knowledge about cognitive tasks, including appropriate contextual and conditional knowledge
	- Self-knowledge

## Using Bloom’s Taxonomy to Write Effective Learning Objectives
## What is Bloom’s Taxonomy
1. *Remembering*: Retrieving, recognizing, and recalling relevant knowledge from long‐term memory.
2. *Understanding*: Constructing meaning from oral, written, and graphic messages through interpreting, exemplifying, classifying, summarizing, inferring, comparing, and explaining.
3. *Applying*: Carrying out or using a procedure for executing, or implementing.
4. *Analyzing*: Breaking material into constituent parts, determining how the parts relate to one another and to an overall structure or purpose through differentiating, organizing, and attributing.
5. *Evaluating*: Making judgments based on criteria and standards through checking and critiquing.
6. *Creating*: Putting elements together to form a coherent or functional whole; reorganizing elements into a new pattern or structure through generating, planning, or producing.

We have updated this pyramid into a “cake-style” hierarchy to emphasize that *each level is built on a foundation of the previous levels*.

## How Bloom’s can aid in course design
Bloom’s taxonomy is a powerful tool to help develop learning objectives because it explains the process of learning:

- Before you can understand a concept, you must remember it.
- To apply a concept you must first understand it.
- In order to evaluate a process, you must have analyzed it.
- To create an accurate conclusion, you must have completed a thorough evaluation.

However, we don’t always start with lower order skills and step all the way through the entire taxonomy for each concept:

1. Are lots of your students freshman? Is this an “Introduction to…” course? If so, many your learning objectives may *target the lower order Bloom’s skills*, because your students are building foundational knowledge. However, even in this situation we would strive to *move a few of your objectives into the applying and analyzing level*, but *getting too far up in the taxonomy could create frustration and unachievable goals*.
2. Are most of your students juniors and seniors? Graduate students? Do your students have a solid foundation in much of the terminology and processes you will be working on your course? If so, then *you should not have many remembering and understanding level objectives*. You may need a few, for any radically new concepts specific to your course. However, these advanced students should be able to master higher-order learning objectives. Too many lower level objectives might cause boredom or apathy.

## How Bloom’s works with learning objectives
These verbs on the table are associated with multiple Bloom’s Taxonomy levels.

For example, you could have an objective that states “At the end of this lesson, students will be able to *explain* the difference between H2O and OH-.” This would be an *understanding* level objective. However, if you wanted the students to be able to “…*explain* the shift in the chemical structure of water throughout its various phases.” This would be an *analyzing* level verb.

## 6 Strategies For Teaching With Bloom’s Taxonomy
By design, Bloom’s Taxonomy focuses attention *away from content* and instruction, and instead emphasizes the ‘cognitive events’ in the mind of a child. 

For decades, education reform has been focused on curriculum, assessment, instruction, and more recently standards, and data, with these efforts only bleeding over into /how students think/ briefly, and by chance. This means that the focus of finite teacher and school resources are not on promoting thinking and understanding, but rather what kinds of things students are going to be thinking about and how they’ll prove they understand them.

## Critique
### Criticism of the taxonomy
Some critiques of the taxonomy's cognitive domain admit the existence of these six categories but *question the existence of a sequential, hierarchical link*. Often, educators view the taxonomy as a hierarchy and *may mistakenly dismiss the lowest levels as unworthy* of teaching. The learning of the lower levels enables the building of skills in the higher levels of the taxonomy, and *in some fields, the most important skills are in the lower levels* (such as identification of species of plants and animals in the field of  [natural history](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_history) ). [Instructional scaffolding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instructional_scaffolding)  of higher-level skills from lower-level skills is an application of  [Vygotskian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vygotskian)   [constructivism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructivism_(philosophy_of_education)) .

*Some consider the three lowest levels as hierarchically ordered, but the three higher levels as parallel*. *Others say that it is sometimes better to move to application before introducing concepts*,[ [citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed) ] the goal being to create a  [problem-based learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Problem-based_learning)  environment where the real world context comes first and the theory second, to promote the student's grasp of the phenomenon, concept, or event.

*The distinction between the categories can be seen as artificial* since any given cognitive task may entail a number of processes. It could even be argued that any attempt to nicely categorize cognitive processes into clean, cut-and-dried classifications undermines the holistic, highly connective and interrelated nature of cognition. This is a criticism that can be directed at taxonomies of mental processes in general.

### Why It May Be Time to Dump Bloom's Taxonom
[Why It May Be Time to Dump Bloom's Taxonomy • TechNotes Blog](https://blog.tcea.org/why-it-may-be-time-to-dump-blooms-taxonomy/)

#### The History of Bloom’s
> The taxonomy was created in 1956 by Benjamin Bloom and some of his colleagues as a way to leave behind behaviorist theories of learning that were being used at the time (memorization, rote learning) and embrace higher-order thinking skills. They incorporated aspects of cognitive, affective, and psycho-motor domains into the taxonomy to make it more all-encompassing. It was a radical change in how educators were taught to teach.

#### Why Bloom’s May Not Be the Best Approach
![[Bloom-6.jpeg]]
> The first reason to reconsider using Bloom’s Taxonomy in the classroom has to do with how the brain works. Thinking does not operate within hierarchies (as outlined in the taxonomy). All of these “levels” happen simultaneously in a variety of places in the brain.

> At more than 60 years old, the taxonomy is simply not supported by any empirical research on learning. […] But there is no clear research on its basic assumption that there are lower- and higher-order thinking skills. The brain doesn’t look at a problem to be solved and decide that it only needs a lower-order process.

> In short, Bloom’s Taxonomy focuses on abstract cognitive domains and not on the individual learner. It is teacher-centered and not student-centered.

#### Conclusion
> Make time to examine what the latest and best research says about effective teaching and learning. TCEA has a **[series of blogs](https://blog.tcea.org/category/edresearch/)** on instructional strategies that have been proven to work, as well as several **[online, self-paced courses](https://tcea.org/learn/courses/#teaching-learning)** that will help you dive into how to apply the best approaches in your classroom.

Voir livre de Sal Kahn à propos de la taxonomie de Bloom:

"In any case, the concept of mastery learning seems to have been smothered under the vast weight of educational orthodoxy, and it languished until the next progressive era—the 1960s—when it was revived, in slightly different form, by a developmental psychologist named Benjamin Bloom and his leading protégé, James Block.3 Bloom and Block suggested refinements in testing methods and the delivery of feedback, but their basic principles came straight out of the Winnetka Plan. Students learned at their own pace, advancing to the next concept only after reaching a prescribed degree of mastery over the previous concept. Teachers served primarily as guides and mentors rather than lecturers. Peer interaction was encouraged; peers helping peers was of benefit not only academically, but in character-building as well. Some students might struggle, but none were given up on." (Khan, Salman, *The One World Schoolhouse*)
