The user interface (UI) is very simple but keep in mind two things:

1. Every UI’s Google products is very simple. Nevertheless, they conceal many hidden features.
2. Google loves to tweak the interface once in while. So if you wake up one morning and don’t find this or that. Don’t be surprised. You’re not crazy. Google made some change. 🤪

That being said, you’ll find three tabs: `Stream`, `Classwork` & `People` (at least, in the iOS app).

For the sake of simplicity and clarity, we will focus on the second tab (Classwork). And to be honest, most of the times, this is where you are going to spend most of your time in Classroom. Just to sum things up, the Stream tab allows you to have a quick view over what has been posted whether it is by you or a student.

I do prefer the second tab where things can be organised (more about that down below 👇).

The third one is a place where you can find all your students. Say you want to find a particular work of one of them or check if it has been duly submitted on time, the People tab is the right place. Among other things.

💡 **Tip**

We found out that Google Classroom was the perfect place to work collaboratively between teachers when elaborating a mock exam. Simply create a new class and add a teacher. When everything’s ready, share your class with your students.

## The Classwork tab

### Create topics

What I appreciate in this middle tab is the possibility to add sections called ”Topics”.

![](Topics.png | 600)

See the + button (it’s probably the only thing to locate)? Click on it and choose `Topic`. By creating topics, you will create different sections so that your stream is organised (remember the first tab?). 

You can even filter your topics in order to find the post you are looking for (and after six months of teaching it can be really difficult).

To filter your topics, press the icon on the right up corner.

💡 **Tip**

Want to move something? Just drag and drop it!

### Create an assignment

By pressing the + button, you have several options. The probably most used one is `Assignment`.

While `Question` and `Materials` possess interesting possibilities, I prefer to create an assignment even if it’s not one, even if I don’t plan to grade anything. Why that? It allows you to have a private conversation with students. 

Now there are two things to consider when you create an assignment.

#### Options to select when adding a doc to your assignment

When you insert a Google Docs (on which your students will find the questions or the work they have to do), you have three choices:

1. Students can edit file
2. Students can view file
3. Make a copy for each student

Whatever you choose, if you want your students to fill something up on the doc you provided, don’t forget to select `Students can edit file` (and quite frankly, one out of two, I forget that option).

#### Select students

You don’t necessarily have to send an assignment to the entire class. If you want to differentiate, you can simply select the students to whom you want to send your assignment. Say you have three of them: an easy one, a medium one and a very difficult one. Select the students to whom you want to send the easy one and so forth.

💡 **Tip**

If students send you some PDF, you can grade your student’s work right on your iPad with Google Classroom. It’s worth noticing it because usually, the browser version has more possibilities. In this case, it’s the opposite. Moreover, if you have a stylus, you’ll be able to grade those assignments exactly if it were paper.

### Question & Materials

#### Question

Insert a question in your classroom to ask something to your students: you may check if they understood your last lesson, you may want to know when they will feel ready for the next assessment or you can ask to vote. Last year, students had to debate and vote for the best debate, the most convincing idea and so on.

In the last screenshot, you can see the results of the vote.

#### Materials

It’s the perfect place to put your textbook, your documents, a link often visited, a YouTube video, etc.

### Reuse post

Classroom offers you a great way to recycle your old posts and save a huge amount of time. Again, press the + button and choose `Reuse post`. Very convenient when you have two classes of the same year group.
