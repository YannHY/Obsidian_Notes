You may ask yourself: “What else do I need to know regarding Google Classroom?”

Well, in the two previous documents we just covered the very basic of Classroom. And you know what? We are going to keep that way because there is a lot to say again. We are going to talk about four awesome features.

Let’s start with notifications.

## 1. Notifications

When you start using Classroom, you will soon notice a tremendous amount of notifications.

Notifications on your iPad (you know how this works):

And notifications by mail! 😱

You may think this is too much. So get rid of the double warning. To do that, in Google Classroom, click on the three lines menu in the upper right, go to the bottom, choose `Settings` and then `Notifications`.

And turn off whatever suits you.

## 2. Invite Guardians

This a possibility you only have in the web browser version.

So you can invite guardians (that is to say the parents) just by writing their email address. They will not have access to Google Classroom but they will receive a summary of the activities posted on Google Classroom. Email summaries do not include grades.

The summary includes:

1. Missing work
2. Upcoming work
3. Class activity (Assignments, questions...)

Guardians can get emails daily or weekly.

## 3. Schedule Assignments

This is an awesome feature for at least three reasons:

1. You prepared some fancy stuff late at night for tomorrow but you don’t want to wake up the all student’s household with unwanted notifications.
2. The following day, you know you won’t have time to send the work to your students. Or worse! You could forget. 😱
3. You want to avoid distracting your students who are with another teacher.

Every time, the answer is: schedule it!

When you create an assignment, tap on the upper three dots and select `Schedule`.

You can now start class video meetings in Classroom.

💡 **Tip**

“If internet speed is slow (🤔), turning off your camera can improve video meeting quality. If audio quality is poor, you can use a phone for audio.” ([Google says it](https://support.google.com/edu/classroom/answer/9776888?co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop&hl=en))
