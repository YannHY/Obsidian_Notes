I discovered smart chips like this: insert a URL (say a YouTube video) and Google Docs will nicely format the link (some kind of grey bubble displaying the video's title instead of an inelegant URL). But that's not it. By doing so, you can preview its content. Even better, you can watch the video without ads and without leaving the tab.

This is the so-called smart chip.

Smart chips are "interactive building blocks" you can insert in a doc and that are linked to other parts of Google’s office suite. Basically, it refers to essentially embedding other apps into Google Docs.

To insert a chip, just type a @ symbol. It’ll pop up a menu that will list a bunch of elements. You can type to narrow it down to the thing you want to include. Hit enter and it will make a smart chip.

Here are a few examples.

Type `@today` to insert the date (or `@tomorrow"` or `@yesterday` and so on and so forth). The date becomes clickable and you can create an event in Calendar. Read [Insert smart chips to get information on people, files, dates & events](https://support.google.com/docs/answer/10710316?hl=en-GB) to learn more.

Type `@name` to insert someone's name (instead of "name", type your contact name). it’ll pop up a menu in which you'll be able to send an email, chat, start a video call, schedule an event...

Type `@document` to link to a document (anything: a presentation, a sheet...). Instead of "document", just type the first letters of your document's title.

There are many possibilities offered by smart chips. For instance, I really like to insert a draft of a mail (you can work collaboratively on this draft, then click on a button to open and send it in Gmail). I also like the dropdown menu option (see the screenshot down below) [^1].

[Google Docs adds customizable dropdown menus and table templates](https://9to5google.com/2022/05/02/google-docs-table-template-dropdown/)

> Meanwhile, Google Docs is also adding table templates to “quickly insert building blocks for common workflows” like a Launch content tracker, Project asset, Review tracker, and Product roadmap. Going hand-in-hand with the new dropdowns, these templates can be added from the Insert > Table menu.

### Videos About Smart Chips
> At Google I/O the Smart Chips for Google docs were announced and they have finally arrived. You can now use the @-mention trick to add people, files, and events from your calendar. Even more functionality such as templates and checklists is rolling out!

> Providing your contact smart chip at the top or even as part of the header in your Hyperdocs gives students easy access to contact you in a variety of ways as they are working. This is so great for distance learning, although super beneficial even when you are hybrid or face-to-face.

#### About Smart Canvas
[GOOGLE WORKSPACE TURNS TO ‘SMART CHIPS’ TO WEAVE DOCS, TASKS, AND MEET TOGETHER](https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/18/22440226/google-workspace-smart-canvas-features-docs-updates)

> The idea behind the smart canvas is similar to workplace productivity suite dreams that reach as [far back as OpenDoc in the ’90s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenDoc): having smaller bits of information like charts, text, and images become more modular and interconnected. It’s not dissimilar to [Microsoft’s Fluid Office document project](https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/19/21260005/microsoft-office-fluid-web-document-features-build), which launched last year.
> [...]
> LastLast week, [Google put up a blog post](https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2021/05/Google-Docs-Canvas-Based-Rendering-Update.html) announcing that “Google Docs will now use canvas based rendering: this may impact some Chrome extensions.” That “canvas” is different from the smart canvas we’ve been discussing. I regret to inform you that we must now briefly discuss web standards, but it’s relevant.
> At a [very high level](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canvas_element), canvas is an element you can put into any HTML page, and as the name suggests, it is an empty space you can use to display more complex things — like stuff built with scripts. Essentially, it sits on top of web technology, but — depending on who you ask — it isn’t _made_ _of_ web technology. It’s a technique for putting code on a webpage that doesn’t necessarily use the stuff you might think of as the code that makes up most of the web like HTML, CSS, and so on.

## Updates
[The Google Docs API is here: you can soon embed other apps into your documents](https://www.theverge.com/2022/10/11/23398294/google-docs-app-embeds-api-chips-canvas) (11-10-2022)

> it’s also opening Docs up to third-party developers in a big way. Going forward, all you’ll need to type is “@” and the name of a file or app you’re looking for, and you’ll be able to see and edit it from within Google Docs.

> The underlying shift here is a huge one, and ==Google’s actually late to it==. Notion, Coda, and other apps have grown popular by evolving digital documents into low-code website builders. You can embed YouTube videos and PDF files, work with your spreadsheets, and manage a kanban board, all within a single “document.” ==Google Docs, meanwhile, has long been stuck emulating an 8.5 x 11 piece of paper==.
