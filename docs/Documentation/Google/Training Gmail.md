## Filters & Labels
![[show-search-options.png | 600]]

### Create a filter
1. In the search box, click `Show search options`.
2. Enter your search criteria.
3. At the bottom of the search window, click `Create filter`.
4. Choose what you’d like the filter to do.
5. Click `Create filter`.

### Label it
For instance, we are going to create a new **label**: `Apply the label` (`Choose label` or `New label`).

You can tick as many boxes as you like. Say `Mark as read` or `Star it` for every message coming from `yhoury@lyceeinternational.london`.

### More interesting stuff
In addition, you can do some quite interesting things.

For instance, apply a label to email from anyone inside your organisation: `*@lyceeinternational.london`

You can say you want any email with an attachment to be labelled say "Has Any Attachment".

Or apply a label to email notifications when someone shares a Drive file with you: `drive-shares-dm-noreply@google.com`

## Chat
While this is not a Gmail feature, the Chat app is nicely integrated to Gmail and it would be lovely to use it more frequently. 

If all you need is a quick and informal answer, there's no need to send an email for that. Using chat not only would be handier, it would declutter our emails too.

In Chat, you can forward to Gmail a whole conversation. You will soon be able to [assign tasks](https://9to5google.com/2022/05/23/google-chat-add-tasks/) and you can install awesome apps!
