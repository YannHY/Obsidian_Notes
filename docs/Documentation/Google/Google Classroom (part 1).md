You have two options if you want to use Google Classroom on your iPad. You can [download the app](https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/google-classroom/id924620788) or simply type this URL `https://classroom.google.com/` in Safari.

In fact, I suggest you do both as you will get some features only available in the app or your web browser.

## 1. What is Classroom?

To make it short, Google Classroom is a free service that aims to help teachers creating, distributing, and grading assignments. It is also designed to ease the process of sharing files between teachers and students. It is what one calls a LMS, which stands for [Learning Management System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning_management_system).

Some teachers prefer to use Google Site and therefore make a website to deliver their courses. You have to choose what better suits you! But do not forget, to quote [Alice Keeler](https://alicekeeler.com/google-classroom/), that ‚ÄúBy design, Google Classroom fosters interactions and collaboration‚Äù. And indeed you will have a lot of opportunities to communicate with your students with Classroom you may not have through a website.

## 2. How to use Classroom?

### Create a class

First of all, you need to create a class by pressing the big + on the right-left corner.

You‚Äôll notice that you have two options: you can either create a class or join a class. For now, we just want to create a class but your students will join the class you created by pressing exactly the same button.

Once you have created your class, you may want some students in it. So you have to invite them by providing a code you will find in the little cog icon located on the upright corner.

Then, you‚Äôll find the code (or a URL if you prefer).

üí° **Tip**

If you use Classroom in your web browser, you will be able to display the code in a way that even your furthest student will be able to see. Of course, you can still zoom in with your fingers on the screen of your iPad or with the remote of the projector.

### Delete or archive your class

At the end of the year, you have the choice to delete or archive your class (or you can do nothing which, in this particular case, can be an option to consider). But if you want to delete a class, first, you have to make an archive. To do that, go to your classes (by pressing the three little lines on the up left corner), choose your class and then press the three dots on the right corner of a class).

If you want to delete a class, go to the Archives, choose your class, press the three dots and choose `Delete`.

## 3. Classroom and Drive

Be aware that when you create a class in Google Classroom, a folder in your Google Drive will be automatically created. Moreover, when you create an assignment, another folder will populate the main Classroom folder. In it, you will find the works of your students with their names automatically attached. It is very convenient and very useful in many cases. But we will tell more about that later.

‚ö†Ô∏è It is highly recommended to not move these folders to another one.
