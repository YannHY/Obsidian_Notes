## Markdown
Did you know that you can format text in your comments?

Of course, there is no menu to select bold or italic but using Markdown, you can now do that easily in Google docs.

Just watch the video ðŸ‘‡.

In a nutshell, writing
- **text** will produce bold text (like this: text),
- _text_ will be in italics (like this: text),
- -text- will produce strikethrough text.

## Hide The Notifications From The Stream
Did you know that, in Google Classroom, you can hide the notifications and therefore declutter your stream?

In Google Classroom, click the cog wheel located on the top right corner.
Go to General > Classwork on the stream > Hide notifications. Then click Save.

By doing so, you keep the stream as the communication area and students will only find their work in the Classwork tab.
The stream will be the place for announcements, discussion or reminders whereas, in Classwork, assignments will be organized (students will be able to filter by topics).

## Create documents super fast
First, create a new tab (cmd + t on a Mac, ctrl + t on a PC).
Then, type [doc.new](https://doc.new/) in the search bar (or click that link. You can even bookmark it).

It works with every Google docs (with or without an "s"):

- [doc.new](https://doc.new/)  
- [docs.new](https://docs.new/)  
- [sheet.new](https://sheet.new/)  
- [sheets.new](https://sheets.new/)  
- [spreadsheet.new](https://spreadsheet.new/)  
- [form.new](https://form.new/)  
- [forms.new](https://forms.new/)  
- [slides.new](https://slides.new/)  
- [slide.new](https://slide.new/)  
- [site.new](https://site.new/)  
- [sites.new](https://sites.new/)

## Drop-down menus
Do you know you can now insert drop-down menus (Insert > Drop-down)?

Alternatively, you can use smart chips (head to our last training session).

Anyway, Drop-down lists are very handy for many reasons, but it's a great way to create interactive exercices right within Google Docs.

Here's an example.

https://docs.google.com/document/d/16R7ZxH5E0UvIhpUBq63gOL4-YYVwonjYg72eWzxuh80/edit?usp=sharing

## Substitution

## Insert a Signature

## Log in faster
If you want to log in to your Google Account, you can click on this URL: [https://accounts.google.com/](https://accounts.google.com/). Then you have to enter your full address.

Want to avoid (to yourself or someone else) writing the all domain name while logging in? Use this URL:

> [https://accounts.google.com/signin/v2/identifier?continue=https%3A%2F%2Fclassroom.google.com%2F&hd=lyceeinternational.london&sacu=1&flowName=GlifWebSignIn&flowEntry=AddSession](https://accounts.google.com/signin/v2/identifier?continue=https%3A%2F%2Fclassroom.google.com%2F&hd=lyceeinternational.london&sacu=1&flowName=GlifWebSignIn&flowEntry=AddSession)  

It will populate the text box with `@lyceeinternational.london`.

## Make a copy
Change the end of an URL by adding `copy`

here is how to share a link with "make a copy" as the default prompt:
 
Go to the sharing dialogue, select "get shareable link", select "anyone with link can view", then select "copy link".
You should have a link that looks like this: `https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/<spreadsheetID>/edit?usp=sharing`

Then change the last part to `copy` (instead of `edit?usp=sharing`), it should look like this:
`https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/<spreadsheetID>/copy`
 
Use that link when sharing and the person you are sharing with will get a prompt to "make a copy" when they click it. You can also bookmark that link so that you get the "make a copy" prompt if you are using it for a template.

## Chat
You can chat with others while working on a Google Docs or a spreadsheet.
To do that, you need to open a document on a computer (not with the iPad app). Or you can open the document in Safari (it wonâ€™t work on Chrome). At the top right corner, where you can see all participants, there is a little icon (an individual with a bubble and three little dots).

This feature wonâ€™t be available if youâ€™re the only one in the file or if people arenâ€™t signed into their Google account.

When you close the doc, the chat isnâ€™t saved.

## Resize an image in Google Docs (on an iPad)
Did you know that you can resize an image in Google Docs. Well Thatâ€™s not an obvious option to find out but if you tap on an image then tap on the capital letter A on the right up corner and choose Text wrap > Inline then you will be able to redimension your photo.

But the easy way is to tap on the three dots on the right up corner and select Print layout then you can resize your image
