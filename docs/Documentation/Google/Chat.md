[Google Chat](https://mail.google.com/chat/u/0/#chat/welcome)

## Question asked in Classroom
Who's using Google Chat?

It seems to me that it is not used that much in our school. However, it could come handy:

-   You can send **direct messages** or have **group discussions** as well.
-   You can use Chat **right in Gmail** or as a **standalone app**.
-   It's **fully integrated** to Google Docs, Sheets, and Slides.
-   it would **declutter our mails** separating... well... chats from real emails.

What do you think?
