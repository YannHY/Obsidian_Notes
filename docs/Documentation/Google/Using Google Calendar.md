Préparer une formation sur Calendar avec au départ un questionnaire pour jauger le niveau, un peu comme ici : [Welcome to the Google Calendar Skills Checklist](https://usingtechbetter.surveysparrow.com/s/Google-Calendar/tt-6ef264057e?)

## Tutoriel créé pour partager un lien Zoom

Wouldn't it be great if students could find in one place all the information they need: their timetable with the Zoom links? What if, on top of that, they could get a reminder saying: "Hey! You have class in 5 minutes?"

With Google Calendar you can do that. Here's how.

This tutorial is divided in two parts:

1. How to create and share a Google Calendar.
2. How to create recurrent events

## How to create and share a Google Calendar

First step, visit the [Google Calendar web page](https://calendar.google.com/).

Scroll down a little bit, click `Add other calendars` (+) and find `Create new calendar`.

When you do, you end up on this page. Provide a name and a description. Click on `Create calendar`.

So we created a new calendar. Ours is labelled "6e1 online".

Now, press the three little dots, select and click the `Settings and sharing` options.

Tick the different boxes that best suits your needs.

For instance, we are going to make the calendar public so the parents outside our organisation can subscribe to this calendar.

Of course, you can invite people. For instance, if you are a CTL and want to invite the teachers of your class to participate, this is the right place to do that.

Or you can, among other things, create an address in iCal format so that one can use any application of their choice to display the calendar.

Now, you are good to go. Your calendar is created, ready to be shared. You only have to populate it. Of course, you are not going to do this by yourself. It would be too long. Ask your team to do it so that every teacher has only a few events to create.

## How to create recurrent events

To create an event, just press the big colourful button located on the top left corner.

![](12.png)

And click on `More options`.

Populate the event with all the information needed (subject, time, Zoom link...). Don't forget to repeat the event every week or every two weeks. So you create one event repeated throughout the year.

If you have a particular class more than once in a week, just duplicate your event and change day and time.

Of course, you can customise everything.

And that's it!
