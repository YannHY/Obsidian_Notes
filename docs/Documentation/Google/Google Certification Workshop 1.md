Reminds me of Pix. You can training your students to get the necessary digital skills a 21st-century citizen need.

[The website](https://applieddigitalskills.withgoogle.com/s/en/home) is awesome. I use it with my students. You can connect your Google Classroom to Applied Digital Skills.

## Webassessor

Can’t tell you what the questions are. When you pass an exam, you sign an NDA. Besides, Google pulls from a question bank. So you may have different questions.

Questions about pedagogy.
You get a specific Google account to take the exam and you are prompted to realise certain tasks

## What’s next?
Most of you don’t need any training. As you are educators using Google tools every day, you probably already know everything.

Keep in mind that the exams are quite easy, a lot easy than the training.

It says each exam takes approximately 3 hours. This is not true. In less than one hour, it’s done.

However, the training is interesting. I learned a lot. And it gives you a glimpse of what you can do, what would be interesting to master.

Finally, while I think most of you know a lot, some of you may need a little bit of training about Google Calendar, Google Groups, or Google Form (and probably Google Site, Task, Blogger…).  So we are going to to have several workshops. Pick the one you want.
