We blocked YouTube for Sixième, Cinquième and EIP 7 & 8. This means that they can’t download the YouTube app nor visit the YouTube website on a browser anymore.

## Sharing YouTube Videos with 6e/5e/EIP 7 & 8

Nonetheless, you may want to share YouTube videos with your students. To do that, you can try one of these five websites. Only Safeyoutube is free.

- [Viewpure](http://www.viewpure.com) (up to 10 videos)
- [Safeshare](https://safeshare.tv/) (up to 20 videos)
- [Edpuzzle](https://edpuzzle.com/) (up to 20 videos)

Edpuzzle and Playposit allow you to make your video interactive. You can, for instance, insert a quiz on your video to make sure pupils understood what they saw before going to the next step.

## Sharing YouTube Videos with older students

If you want to share a YouTube video with older students who can still download the app but if you want to avoid any kind of distractions such as ads, comments or suggested videos, you may use:

- [VLC](https://www.videolan.org/vlc/index.en-GB.html) (unfortunately it doesn’t seem to work on an iPad. On a PC: `Media` > `Open Network Stream`)
- Google Forms
- Google Sites
- Google Slides (insert a video, choose when to start or to end it; you may add a description or questions as well)

Note that to use this Google Slides function, you need to open it up in Safari if you want to do it on your iPad.
