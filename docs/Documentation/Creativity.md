Ken Robinson, *Out of our minds*

## The creative process

> I define creativity as the process of having original ideas that have value. There are three key terms here: *process*, *original* and *value*.

### Generating ideas
> In the early stages, being creative may involve playing with an idea, doodling or improvising around the theme. It may begin with a thought that is literally half-formed: with a sketch, a first plan or a design; the first notes of a melody or the intimation of a solution to a problem.

> Creativity does not always require freedom from constraints or a blank page. A lot of creative work has to work to specific briefs or conventions and great work often comes from working within formal constraints. ➝ exemple de la poésie (songer à Ronsard ou Baudelaire)
> [...]
> These do not inhibit the writer’s creativity; they set a framework for it. The creative achievement and the aesthetic pleasure lie in using standard forms to achieve unique effects and original insights.

Doing something:

> As I mentioned earlier, being creative always involves doing something, so it will always involve using some form of media. These may be physical media, such as steel, wood, clay, fabric or food; they may be sensory media, like sound, light, the voice or the body; they may be cognitive media, including words, numbers, or notation. 
> [...]
> Creativity is a dialogue between the ideas and the media in which they are being formed.

### Making judgments
> Creativity is not only about generating ideas; it involves making judgments about them. The process includes elaborating on the initial ideas, testing and refining them and even rejecting them, in favor of others that emerge during the process. Sometimes creative works arrive in the world more or less fully formed and need no further work.
> [...]
> You can see examples of the iterative nature of the creative process in the successive drafts of poems and novels, of scholarly papers or in designs for inventions and so on.

Trial and error:
> He [Terrance Tao] says that discovery in mathematics is a constant process of trial and error: “You come up with a wrong idea,” he says, “work on it for a month and realize it doesn’t work and then you come up with the next wrong idea and then finally by process of elimination you come up with something that does work.” I asked the renowned chemist, Sir Harry Kroto, how many of his experiments fail. He said about 95 percent of them. Of course failure is not the right word, he said: “You’re just finding out what doesn’t work.”[...] I don’t mean to say that being wrong is the same thing as being creative but if you’re not prepared to be wrong, it’s unlikely that you’ll ever come up with anything original.
> Evaluating which ideas work and which don’t, involves judgment and critical thinking.
> [...]
> At the right time and in the right way, critical appraisal is essential. At the wrong point, it can kill an emerging idea.

## Judging value
Histoire intéressante de Michael Faraday

> In the mid-1830s, Michael Faraday gave the first demonstration of electromagnetism at the Royal Institution in London. He stood in a gaslit lecture theatre before a distinguished audience of scientists and showed bright blue sparks leaping between two copper spheres. The audience was impressed but many of them were at a loss to know what to make of it all. “This is all very interesting, Mr Faraday,” said one of them. “But what use is it?” “I don’t know,” Faraday is purported to have said, “What use is a newborn baby?” A world without electricity is now unthinkable. Our lives depend on it in almost every way, from food supplies to transport to heating, lighting and telecommunications. The nineteenth century saw few of the uses of electricity that we now take for granted. It was not as if people’s homes were cluttered with dishwashers and televisions, simply waiting for Faraday to complete his experiments. The applications of electricity only followed the harnessing of electricity itself. Faraday’s discoveries helped to create circumstances in which these applications were developed.

### Being original
What is something new?

> Creativity is about coming up with new ideas. But what do we mean by new? Do we have to come up with something that has never been thought of before? Common sense suggests not

## Making connections
> Creative insights often occur by making unusual connections: seeing analogies between ideas that have not previously been related. All of our existing ideas have creative possibilities. Creative insights occur when they are combined in unexpected ways or applied to questions or issues with which they are not normally associated.

 Un peu plus loin dans le livre, Robinson explique :
 
> Discovering the right medium is often a tidal moment in the creative life of the individual.

La créativité naîtrait de la relation au matériel utilisé comme le musicien aimant le son produit ou l'écrivain par le pouvoir évocateur des mots.
