Introduction to Learning Design What Is Bloom\u2019s Taxonomy? A Definition For Teachers \u29eb Bloom\u2019s Taxonomy is a hierarchical ordering of cognitive skills that can help teachers teach and students learn. Bloom\u2019s Taxonomy was created by Benjamin Bloom in 1956 . The original sequence of cognitive skills was Knowledge, Comprehension, Application, Analysis, Synthesis, Evaluation The framework was revised in 2001 by Lorin Anderson and David Krathwohl. The most significant change was the removal of \u2018Synthesis\u2019 and the addition of \u2018Creation\u2019 . There are six levels in Bloom\u2019s Taxonomy. The initialism RUA2EC may be useful to recall the levels: The 6 Levels of Bloom\u2019s Taxonomy \u29eb The first level of Bloom\u2019s Taxonomy is to Remember . Example activities at the Remembering level: memorize a poem , recall state capitals , remember math formulas The second level of Bloom\u2019s Taxonomy is to Understand . Example activities at the Understanding level: organize the animal kingdom based on a given framework , illustrate the difference between a rectangle and square , summarize the plot of a simple story The third level of Bloom\u2019s Taxonomy is to Apply . Example activities at the Application level: use a formula to solve a problem , select a design to meet a purpose , reconstruct the passage of a new law through a given government/system The fourth level of Bloom\u2019s Taxonomy is to Analyze .

Attribute to the Vanderbilt University Center for Teaching) In 1956, Benjamin Bloom with collaborators Max Englehart, Edward Furst, Walter Hill, and David Krathwohl published a framework for categorizing educational goals : Taxonomy of Educational Objectives. Familiarly known as Bloom\u2019s Taxonomy , this framework has been applied by generations of K-12 teachers and college instructors in their teaching. The framework consisted of six major categories: Knowledge, Comprehension, Application, Analysis, Synthesis, and Evaluation. The categories after Knowledge were presented as \u201c skills and abilities ,\u201d with the understanding that knowledge was the necessary precondition for putting these skills and abilities into practice . Each category contained subcategories, all lying along a continuum from simple to complex and concrete to abstract. The Original Taxonomy (1956) \u29eb Authors\u2019 brief explanations of these main categories from the appendix of /Taxonomy of Educational Objectives/ (/Handbook One/). Knowledge \u201cinvolves the recall of specifics and universals, the recall of methods and processes, or the recall of a pattern, structure, or setting. Comprehension \u201crefers to a type of understanding or apprehension such that the individual knows what is being communicated and can make use of the material or idea being communicated without necessarily relating it to other material or seeing its fullest implications.\u201d Application refers to the \u201cuse of abstractions in particular and concrete situations.\u201d Analysis represents the \u201cbreakdown of a communication into its constituent elements or parts such that the relative hierarchy of ideas is made clear and/or the relations between ideas expressed are made explicit.\u201d Synthesis involves the \u201cputting together of elements and parts so as to form a whole.\u201d Evaluation engenders \u201cjudgments about the value of material and methods for given purposes.\u201d The Revised Taxonomy (2001) \u29eb Revision of Bloom\u2019s Taxonomy: A Taxonomy for Teaching, Learning, and Assessment . The authors of the revised taxonomy underscore this dynamism, using verbs and gerunds to label their categories and subcategories (rather than the nouns of the original taxonomy). These \u201caction words\u201d describe the cognitive processes by which thinkers encounter and work with knowledge. Remember Recognizing Recalling Understand Interpreting Exemplifying Classifying Summarizing Inferring Comparing Explaining Apply Executing Implementing Analyze Differentiating Organizing Attributing Evaluate Checking Critiquing Create Generating Planning Producing In the revised taxonomy, knowledge is at the basis of these six cognitive processes , but its authors created a separate taxonomy of the types of knowledge used in cognition: Factual Knowledge Knowledge of terminology Knowledge of specific details and elements Conceptual Knowledge Knowledge of classifications and categories Knowledge of principles and generalizations Knowledge of theories, models, and structures Procedural Knowledge Knowledge of subject-specific skills and algorithms Knowledge of subject-specific techniques and methods Knowledge of criteria for determining when to use appropriate procedures Metacognitive Knowledge Strategic Knowledge Knowledge about cognitive tasks, including appropriate contextual and conditional knowledge Self-knowledge ( Link ) Using Bloom\u2019s Taxonomy to Write Effective Learning Objectives \u29eb What is Bloom\u2019s Taxonomy \u29eb Remembering : Retrieving, recognizing, and recalling relevant knowledge from long\u2010term memory. Understanding : Constructing meaning from oral, written, and graphic messages through interpreting, exemplifying, classifying, summarizing, inferring, comparing, and explaining. Applying : Carrying out or using a procedure for executing, or implementing. Analyzing : Breaking material into constituent parts, determining how the parts relate to one another and to an overall structure or purpose through differentiating, organizing, and attributing. Evaluating : Making judgments based on criteria and standards through checking and critiquing. Creating : Putting elements together to form a coherent or functional whole; reorganizing elements into a new pattern or structure through generating, planning, or producing. We have updated this pyramid into a \u201ccake-style\u201d hierarchy to emphasize that each level is built on a foundation of the previous levels . (You may use this graphic for educational or non-profit use if you include a credit for Jessica Shabatura and citation back to this website.) How Bloom\u2019s can aid in course design \u29eb Bloom\u2019s taxonomy is a powerful tool to help develop learning objectives because it explains the process of learning: Before you can understand a concept, you must remember it. To apply a concept you must first understand it. In order to evaluate a process, you must have analyzed it. To create an accurate conclusion, you must have completed a thorough evaluation. However, we don\u2019t always start with lower order skills and step all the way through the entire taxonomy for each concept: Are lots of your students freshman? Is this an \u201cIntroduction to\u2026\u201d course? If so, many your learning objectives may target the lower order Bloom\u2019s skills , because your students are building foundational knowledge. However, even in this situation we would strive to move a few of your objectives into the applying and analyzing level , but getting too far up in the taxonomy could create frustration and unachievable goals . Are most of your students juniors and seniors? Graduate students? Do your students have a solid foundation in much of the terminology and processes you will be working on your course? If so, then you should not have many remembering and understanding level objectives . You may need a few, for any radically new concepts specific to your course. However, these advanced students should be able to master higher-order learning objectives. Too many lower level objectives might cause boredom or apathy. How Bloom\u2019s works with learning objectives \u29eb These verbs on the table are associated with multiple Bloom\u2019s Taxonomy levels. For example, you could have an objective that states \u201cAt the end of this lesson, students will be able to explain the difference between H2O and OH-.\u201d This would be an understanding level objective. However, if you wanted the students to be able to \u201c\u2026 explain the shift in the chemical structure of water throughout its various phases.\u201d This would be an analyzing level verb.

For decades, education reform has been focused on curriculum, assessment, instruction, and more recently standards, and data, with these efforts only bleeding over into /how students think/ briefly, and by chance. This means that the focus of finite teacher and school resources are not on promoting thinking and understanding, but rather what kinds of things students are going to be thinking about and how they\u2019ll prove they understand them. ( Link ) Critique \u29eb Criticism of the taxonomy \u29eb Some critiques of the taxonomy's cognitive domain admit the existence of these six categories but question the existence of a sequential, hierarchical link . Often, educators view the taxonomy as a hierarchy and may mistakenly dismiss the lowest levels as unworthy of teaching. The learning of the lower levels enables the building of skills in the higher levels of the taxonomy, and in some fields, the most important skills are in the lower levels (such as identification of species of plants and animals in the field of natural history ). Instructional scaffolding of higher-level skills from lower-level skills is an application of Vygotskian constructivism . Some consider the three lowest levels as hierarchically ordered, but the three higher levels as parallel . Others say that it is sometimes better to move to application before introducing concepts ,[ citation needed ] the goal being to create a problem-based learning environment where the real world context comes first and the theory second, to promote the student's grasp of the phenomenon, concept, or event. The distinction between the categories can be seen as artificial since any given cognitive task may entail a number of processes. It could even be argued that any attempt to nicely categorize cognitive processes into clean, cut-and-dried classifications undermines the holistic, highly connective and interrelated nature of cognition. This is a criticism that can be directed at taxonomies of mental processes in general. Link Why It May Be Time to Dump Bloom's Taxonom \u29eb Why It May Be Time to Dump Bloom's Taxonomy \u2022 TechNotes Blog The History of Bloom\u2019s \u29eb The taxonomy was created in 1956 by Benjamin Bloom and some of his colleagues as a way to leave behind behaviorist theories of learning that were being used at the time (memorization, rote learning) and embrace higher-order thinking skills. They incorporated aspects of cognitive, affective, and psycho-motor domains into the taxonomy to make it more all-encompassing. It was a radical change in how educators were taught to teach. Why Bloom\u2019s May Not Be the Best Approach \u29eb The first reason to reconsider using Bloom\u2019s Taxonomy in the classroom has to do with how the brain works. Thinking does not operate within hierarchies (as outlined in the taxonomy). All of these \u201clevels\u201d happen simultaneously in a variety of places in the brain. At more than 60 years old, the taxonomy is simply not supported by any empirical research on learning. [\u2026] But there is no clear research on its basic assumption that there are lower- and higher-order thinking skills. The brain doesn\u2019t look at a problem to be solved and decide that it only needs a lower-order process. In short, Bloom\u2019s Taxonomy focuses on abstract cognitive domains and not on the individual learner. It is teacher-centered and not student-centered. Conclusion \u29eb Make time to examine what the latest and best research says about effective teaching and learning. TCEA has a series of blogs on instructional strategies that have been proven to work, as well as several online, self-paced courses that will help you dive into how to apply the best approaches in your classroom.

There are three key terms here: process , original and value . Generating ideas \u29eb In the early stages, being creative may involve playing with an idea, doodling or improvising around the theme. It may begin with a thought that is literally half-formed: with a sketch, a first plan or a design; the first notes of a melody or the intimation of a solution to a problem. Creativity does not always require freedom from constraints or a blank page. A lot of creative work has to work to specific briefs or conventions and great work often comes from working within formal constraints. \u279d exemple de la po\u00e9sie (songer \u00e0 Ronsard ou Baudelaire) [...] These do not inhibit the writer\u2019s creativity; they set a framework for it. The creative achievement and the aesthetic pleasure lie in using standard forms to achieve unique effects and original insights. Doing something: As I mentioned earlier, being creative always involves doing something, so it will always involve using some form of media. These may be physical media, such as steel, wood, clay, fabric or food; they may be sensory media, like sound, light, the voice or the body; they may be cognitive media, including words, numbers, or notation. [...] Creativity is a dialogue between the ideas and the media in which they are being formed. Making judgments \u29eb Creativity is not only about generating ideas; it involves making judgments about them. The process includes elaborating on the initial ideas, testing and refining them and even rejecting them, in favor of others that emerge during the process. Sometimes creative works arrive in the world more or less fully formed and need no further work. [...] You can see examples of the iterative nature of the creative process in the successive drafts of poems and novels, of scholarly papers or in designs for inventions and so on. Trial and error: He [Terrance Tao] says that discovery in mathematics is a constant process of trial and error: \u201cYou come up with a wrong idea,\u201d he says, \u201cwork on it for a month and realize it doesn\u2019t work and then you come up with the next wrong idea and then finally by process of elimination you come up with something that does work.\u201d I asked the renowned chemist, Sir Harry Kroto, how many of his experiments fail. He said about 95 percent of them. Of course failure is not the right word, he said: \u201cYou\u2019re just finding out what doesn\u2019t work.\u201d[...] I don\u2019t mean to say that being wrong is the same thing as being creative but if you\u2019re not prepared to be wrong, it\u2019s unlikely that you\u2019ll ever come up with anything original. Evaluating which ideas work and which don\u2019t, involves judgment and critical thinking. [...] At the right time and in the right way, critical appraisal is essential. At the wrong point, it can kill an emerging idea. Judging value \u29eb Histoire int\u00e9ressante de Michael Faraday In the mid-1830s, Michael Faraday gave the first demonstration of electromagnetism at the Royal Institution in London. He stood in a gaslit lecture theatre before a distinguished audience of scientists and showed bright blue sparks leaping between two copper spheres. The audience was impressed but many of them were at a loss to know what to make of it all. \u201cThis is all very interesting, Mr Faraday,\u201d said one of them. \u201cBut what use is it?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Faraday is purported to have said, \u201cWhat use is a newborn baby?\u201d A world without electricity is now unthinkable. Our lives depend on it in almost every way, from food supplies to transport to heating, lighting and telecommunications. The nineteenth century saw few of the uses of electricity that we now take for granted. It was not as if people\u2019s homes were cluttered with dishwashers and televisions, simply waiting for Faraday to complete his experiments. The applications of electricity only followed the harnessing of electricity itself. Faraday\u2019s discoveries helped to create circumstances in which these applications were developed. Being original \u29eb What is something new? Creativity is about coming up with new ideas. But what do we mean by new? Do we have to come up with something that has never been thought of before? Common sense suggests not Making connections \u29eb Creative insights often occur by making unusual connections: seeing analogies between ideas that have not previously been related.

You may have read a lot about it in fact. And you certainly known that differentiate is necessary even sometimes mandatory, but what is it exactly and how do we do that? What this means in practice? Well, as a start, I love to quote this sentence from Ken Robison in Creative schools : One of the perils of standardized education is the idea that one size fits all. (chapter 9, Bring it all back home) This is quite self-explanatory and I don\u2019t want to state the obvious but this means that, most of the time, teachers need to tailor their lesson to fit the learning need of students. You probably saw this picture: So it\u2019s all about giving students of all capabilities the best chance of learning. And to do that, at Lyc\u00e9e International de Londres Winston-Churchill, we have a large range of possibilities. We can show you concrete and working examples of truly amazing differentiated activities. French \u29eb In French, we have this particular exercice we call \u201cdict\u00e9e\u201d. It\u2019s a spelling exercice. Basically, the teacher dictates a text and students try their best to write it down. Traditionally, everyone is writing the same text, at the same moment, at the same pace. But, in our school, we do things differently. We don\u2019t provide one exercise for the all class but up to four. Each exercise represents one level of difficulty: the first one is the easiest. We call it the \u201cgreen track\u201d. The second one is a little bit more difficult. This is the \u201cblue track\u201d. The third becomes quite complex. This is the \u201cred track\u201d. And the last one, the \u201cblack track\u201d, is very challenging. The teacher records these spelling exercices in an mp3 format. These records are embedded in a book (an ePub made with Pages ). Students can listen to them at their own pace and even redo them if they failed. All they need is their iPad, headphones, a pen and a piece of paper. When it comes to assessing, we have a flexible method: students can repeat the assessment as many times as necessary. We teach grammar the same way we teach spelling. We are making different groups of different levels. In a book , students have the entire curriculum of the year and even more! According to the group in which they are, they will have to do specific exercises. It is a kind of menu. All students have a spreadsheet in which they tell the teacher where they are in the process of learning grammar. They can say: \u201cEverything\u2019s OK. I\u2019m working\u201d, \u201cI\u2019m struggling. Please help me\u201d or \u201cI\u2019m done. I want to do the test\u201d. Thanks to Google Classroom and a formula called IMPORT RANGE in Google Spreadsheet, all these information is gathered in the teacher\u2019s spreadsheet. As students work in an autonomous way (of course they can help each other), if they did not pass the test, they can ask for another one. Physic \u29eb The Physic teacher send a Google form to his students. For instance, an exercice with questions about gravitation (simple questions like True or False). By going to Settings then Quizzes and choosing Make this a quiz , he is able to grade students automatically. He then exports results in a spreadsheet where he inserted a column labelled \u201cScore final\u201d. It simply fetches the grade with a formula which basically says if the grade is higher than this, it is OK (and it is green). If not, this is not OK and it is red. Something like this =if(A1>=10, \u201cok\u201d, \u201cno\u201d) . In the spreadsheet, he also added two columns. The first one is a link leading to the correction. The second one indicates the next step: redo the quiz or go to the next stage of the lesson. Finally, using the add-on form Mule , he sends automatically to all students their results and the instructions: everything\u2019s ok? So read the correction, follow the next step. The student failed? Read some extra explanations, take the quiz one more time, etc. Math \u29eb Render unto Caesar the things which are Caesar's. The math teacher is the inventor of a well-known metaphor in our school. The black piste for instance is a pretty steep and difficult one. This is for experts. A red piste is moderately difficult. The green track exercises are consolidation or remedial exercises. Thus one or more exercises are available to help students acquire and master the concept. In these exercices, students can follow several paths but all of them have to achieve mandatory exercices. But differentiation is also about helping students to work at their own pace. If this one works really fast, this other student may need a little bit of extra-time. English \u29eb Let\u2019s stay in the sport\u2019s field. During English lessons, at the beginning of the year, students have a test, the same test for everyone, say in year 8. After this test, students may be put in a different group: Bronze, Silver or Gold. As you can see on the above screenshot, students are given different exercices according to their level. Bronze level: Match the pictures with the text on Classroom. Silver level: Write down what the name of each activity is. Gold level: Write the name of each activity and then a sentence about three, saying how much you enjoy it. As for the exercises of the red and black courses, they allow students who are the most comfortable with a notion to go deeper, to go further, to challenge themselves. These exercises go off the beaten track. They are generally research exercises, open-ended problems. They can introduce a concept that will be developed in a subsequent year. German \u29eb I love this use of Thinglink as it offers a very nice and understandable view of the work that must be accomplished by students. As you can see on the above screenshot, we have an image of mountains to climb. There are three paths which correspond to three levels of difficulty. Art \u29eb This is a nice project: students have to build arcade games using Microsoft MakeCode (if you don\u2019t know what it is, just have a look at this page: What is Microsoft MakeCode? ). To sum things up: Microsoft MakeCode is a free, open source platform for creating engaging computer science learning experiences that support a progression path into real-world programming. In this project, students are all doing the same activity. The lesson plan is displayed on the board. Everyone follow the instructions and work autonomously. By doing that way, the teacher is free to grant some time to the students who need the most of her help while the more able are working alone (they have all they need, all the resources: tutorials, videos and so on). Some of these students are the \u201cpillars\u201d of the class and students who seek help can rely on them if they have any questions. In addition to that, the grading has also been adapted. The more you invest yourself on the project, the more you are rewarded. For instance, if you were involved but didn\u2019t really succeed, you got a 4 out fo 4. Nevertheless, if you are very gifted but not involved, you don\u2019t end up with more than a 2 out of 4. Have a look on this great game made by a student: Do not catch Corona! That is awesome! For the IBDP class, in Art, the differentiation that takes place is that we must look at all of the students individually to see which artists they are inspired by, and ensure that their own ideas incorporate the ideas of their artists. In these slides, you can see that each individual student has their own slides dedicated to them, which explains what they must do for their homework. NSI \u29eb In the French curriculum, NSI stands for \u201cNum\u00e9rique et Sciences Informatiques\u201d (which can be translated by something like \u201cDigital and Computer sciences\u201d). Students learn Python, among other things. The teacher gives an activity divided in two parts: a quiz (this is the first part) and exercices (this is the second part). Depending on which result they get in the quiz, students receive only certain exercices in the second part. The quiz is made with Google Forms so students get immediate results. The code is written in Colab . If you don\u2019t know Colab, have a look at the FAQ : Colaboratory, or \u201cColab\u201d for short, is a product from Google Research. Colab allows anybody to write and execute arbitrary python code through the browser, and is especially well suited to machine learning, data analysis and education.

To sum things up: Microsoft MakeCode is a free, open source platform for creating engaging computer science learning experiences that support a progression path into real-world programming. In this project, students are all doing the same activity. The lesson plan is displayed on the board. Everyone follow the instructions and work autonomously. By doing that way, the teacher is free to grant some time to the students who need the most of her help while the more able are working alone (they have all they need, all the resources: tutorials, videos and so on). Some of these students are the \u201cpillars\u201d of the class and students who seek help can rely on them if they have any questions. In addition to that, the grading has also been adapted. The more you invest yourself on the project, the more you are rewarded. For instance, if you were involved but didn\u2019t really succeed, you got a 4 out fo 4. Nevertheless, if you are very gifted but not involved, you don\u2019t end up with more than a 2 out of 4. Have a look on this great game made by a student: Do not catch Corona! That is awesome! For the IBDP class, in Art, the differentiation that takes place is that we must look at all of the students individually to see which artists they are inspired by, and ensure that their own ideas incorporate the ideas of their artists. In these slides, you can see that each individual student has their own slides dedicated to them, which explains what they must do for their homework.","title":"Art"},{"location":"Documentation/Differentiation/#nsi","text":"In the French curriculum, NSI stands for \u201cNum\u00e9rique et Sciences Informatiques\u201d (which can be translated by something like \u201cDigital and Computer sciences\u201d). Students learn Python, among other things. The teacher gives an activity divided in two parts: a quiz (this is the first part) and exercices (this is the second part). Depending on which result they get in the quiz, students receive only certain exercices in the second part. The quiz is made with Google Forms so students get immediate results. The code is written in Colab . If you don\u2019t know Colab, have a look at the FAQ : Colaboratory, or \u201cColab\u201d for short, is a product from Google Research.

A stylus? So ditch that marker and start writing on your device with these apps instead of using the physical whiteboard on your class: GoodNotes Notability Concepts Why? \u29eb Written notes are awesome and colourful but I guess you probably have a limited range of two or three colours if you use a physical whiteboard whereas you\u2019ll have a merely infinite range of colours on the aforementioned apps. Moreover, on note-taking apps such as Notability or GoodNotes, you can add rich content like images, sounds, shapes... Even a web page! And, last but not least, when you are online, you can share your whiteboard easily. This is an important feature when your students learn remotely but also when you have to deal with hybrid learning and you want to show what you are writing to both students who attend in person and online. Plus \u29eb By using your iPad (or any tablet by the way), You won\u2019t turn your back to your students anymore. You\u2019ll be able to write while walking through your class (be careful though). You\u2019ll never have to erase at the end of the class your lesson (and think of it: why would we have to erase all the work we\u2019ve done?) You can send it to a missing student (simply export your board to PDF or image). Students can review the lesson at their own pace (if you recorded the lesson). How to do that? \u29eb As a start, I mentioned some great iPad apps, but here are some of the apps I use as a whiteboard and this is how I share my lesson with students. Whiteboard apps \u29eb Whiteboard (Microsoft\u2019s iPad app) Jamboard (Google\u2019s iPad app) GeoGebra Notes . Peer.school WhiteBoard.fi CryptPad Whiteboard Chat Ziteboard How to share with online students \u29eb Most of the time, when remote learning occurs, we can use the Zoom built-in whiteboard. But, as you will see down below, you can find more and more powerful whiteboard apps. Whatever your choice will be, in Zoom, go to Share Content > Whiteboard or Screen (if you prefer apps such as Notability or JamBoard). In my view, we must understand that we need both a conference and a whiteboard app. As one can read in this Medium post : With the academic year getting started, various challenges with distanced learning are starting to emerge. Conferencing tools address the audio and video needs to some extent. The free form instructional aspects of a classroom, such as writing a problem on a whiteboard and watching students work on it, taking notes as a teacher writes on a whiteboard, walking up to the whiteboard to participate are sorely missed. Therefore, we do need a videoconferencing app such as Zoom or Meet but we also need a whiteboard app. According to your need, some of the apps we\u2019ve mentioned will best suit you. What I like in these apps \u29eb GoodNotes and Notability are great note-taking apps (and with a projector, you have a really nice whiteboard to share with all your students). And if you want to get a glimpse on the possibilities of the latter, please have a look at Tips for Online Learning Using Notability . But whatever are the qualities of these apps, they are not very good when it comes to collaboration (even the new GoodNotes features are quite limited ). So you\u2019d better look for apps like those from Microsoft or Google: Whiteboard & Jamboard . Microsoft and Google are good about sharing. Notability is a very powerful app. I use it all the time as a whiteboard but if I want students to intervene, to write an answer, an app like Jamboard if far more convincing. But you may also have a look at some free powerful web apps such as Peer.school, WhiteBoard.fi, Whiteboard Chat, etc. All these apps allow you to write and collaborate with students. Peer.school \u29eb I do like Peer.school . It\u2019s a free and open-source project. In addition to that, you can find the code on GitHub . It\u2019s a very simple app. Indeed, there\u2019s nothing much you can do apart from writing. But all you need is a browser. No registration needed. And I really appreciate that students see the teacher\u2019s camera video while he or she writes on the board. WhiteBoard.fi \u29eb WhiteBoard.fi is a lot more elaborate. It\u2019s free and they have a very nice privacy statement as well. Here\u2019s an excerpt: No registration is required to use the service. No username, e-mail or password is required. No personal information is stored or collected. The participants are asked their names when they enter a room (in order for the teacher to identify them), but nicknames or aliases can be used. All information is deleted when a room is closed (or after 2 hours of inactivity). No information is shared with third parties. No tracking ads are displayed on the service. Moreover, the website is frequently updated and it would take too long to list all the features, but I like the possibility a teacher has to control who enters your room (your session) or to lock it after your class has started. I also do like the ease with which you can insert math symbols, expressions or equations. Indeed, there is a math editor and you can even insert LaTeX code. More on that on this YouTube video How to use the math tool . Whiteboard Chat \u29eb Whiteboard Chat is probably the most fascinating iteration of this kind of app since it introduces the fusion of a full collaborative whiteboard with a conferencing video app. Moreover, it\u2019s free. It\u2019s possible to use it without logging in, so it\u2019s quick and handy. And there is a ton of nice features such as creating a poll, set a timer, insert math or music symbols, invite people, etc. You also have a nice grid view allowing you to see every page of the whiteboard (provided that you chose the Start teaching option at the beginning). Handy when your students are working on different pages. However, to save your whiteboard you will have to log in to your Google or Facebook account. Ziteboard \u29eb This one is not free (at least not completely: see the pricing on this page ). In the free plan, you can create 3 whiteboards. It reminds me a little bit of the iPad app Concepts which presents some kind of infinite canvas. It means that you can write something and instead of erasing it or even create another kind of slides like in Jamboard, you can scroll wherever you want and keep writing again and again. Actually, the name \u201cZiteboard\u201d come from merging zoomable and whiteboard ! Of course, you can invite people to work on your board. You have nice features like importing an image, a PDF or an mp3. I do like the possibility to insert a PDF whether it is your own document you want to share or a student\u2019s work you want to display. But, again, the app is not completely free. Tableau noir \u29eb Don\u2019t like whiteboards? Do you prefer a blackboard? We have that too. Go to Tableaunoir , an online blackboard. You can hide the toolbar so everyone can focus on the board. It\u2019s nice and neat. Here are the main features: Of course, you can draw and erase, with your mouse or a graphic tablet. You can also use kind of predefined fridge magnets that you can move on the board, to make animation e.g. for illustrating sorting algorithms, graphs algorithms etc (and even playing Go!). Create your own customized \"fridge magnets\" for interactive courses, by importing any image. Color palette for chalk (c, 7 colors black/white, yellow, orange, blue, red, pink, green), Change the color of magnets' background, Load/Save the current board, Add texts (Enter and type), and move texts. Supports LaTeX (using MathJax )! Switch to a whiteboard instead of a blackboard, Collaborate and edit the same board at the same time (need a server for that), Change from right-handed (default) to left-handed cursor, Add as many new half-board as you need, going right with \u2192 and then left/right with \u2190/\u2192 keyboard arrows, You can watch a video on YouTube (in French) explaining how to use it. And you can download the source code as well on GitHub ! There\u2019s more \u29eb We mentioned at the beginning of this article that we needed two apps: a videoconferencing app and a whiteboard app as well. But there is two more use of whiteboards I\u2019d like to mention. Explain anything to a student \u29eb This time, we are going to use a whiteboard not for the all class, but for one student only. And to do that, we are going to use a screen recording app such as Loom when we want to explain something specific which requires more than a few lines in a mail. In fact, to be able to display the work of a student and to explain the mistakes that have been made is simply extraordinary. This is something quite easy to do in a brick-and-mortar school when everyone is physically present but if you are online, this comes handy. So, every time a student sends a message and says \u201cI don\u2019t understand this and that\u201d, I choose to display the student\u2019s work in one of the aforementioned apps and I record my explanations, all the things I\u2019m writing on the board with Loom whether it is on my iPad or my Mac. Record your lesson in a brief video \u29eb In class, when we are running out of time and that I don\u2019t want to take more time to make the students write the lesson because I want to move on and work on the next activity, I choose, when I go home, to record a brief video explaining quickly what is the gist of our work so that they know what they have to learn and remember. Of course, if you don\u2019t have or don\u2019t want to take the time to do it (but keep in mind this is not time-consuming because apps like Loom or Screencastify make this very easy and quick), you can simply record your lesson right during your class. Therefore, you simply record what you say and what you show on the projector using a whiteboard app.","title":"Discover the power of whiteboards apps"},{"location":"Documentation/Discover%20the%20power%20of%20whiteboards%20apps/#why","text":"Written notes are awesome and colourful but I guess you probably have a limited range of two or three colours if you use a physical whiteboard whereas you\u2019ll have a merely infinite range of colours on the aforementioned apps.

A small book (nearly half of it is made of notes/bibliography) If you don't have time to read it, watch this video (at least from 2:10 to 41:31): A \"healthy skepticism about technology\"? ( link ) skeptics tinkerers charismatics Tinkerers \u29eb Tinkerers see schools and universities as complex systems that can be improved, but they believe that major improvement is the product of many years of incremental changes to existing institutions rather than the result of one stroke of wholesale renewal . Tinkerers study past efforts at educational reform to avoid replicating past mistakes. Tinkerers harbor an optimism that technology can be used to improve teaching and learning, but they embrace research and critique as a crucial check against utopian thinking . Charismatic technologists orchestrate boom-and-bust hype cycles, cajoling local systems into making major changes and then moving on when transformation proves elusive. Tinkerers persist much longer with their designs, their partners, and their communities. Tinkering offers a middle way between the charismatic and the skeptical. ( Failure to disrupt , Introduction) A word about \u201ccomputer criticism\u201d \u29eb The name does not imply that such writing would condemn computers any more than literary criticism condemns literature or social criticism condemns society. The purpose of computer criticism is not to condemn but to understand, to explicate, to place in perspective. Of course, understanding does not exclude hard (perhaps even captious) judgment. The result of understanding may well be to debunk . But critical judgment may also open our eyes to previously unnoticed virtue. (Seymour Papert) Reich debunks edtech myths \u29eb For instance, MOOCs were supposed to revolutionize higher education. Coursera\u2019s goal \"is to take the best courses from the best instructors at the best universities and provide it to everyone around the world for free\" ( What we're learning from online education , Daphne Koller) The first big bet was that MOOCs would transform the delivery model of higher education, led by a new generation of online providers. The second big bet was that MOOCs would dramatically expand global access to higher education. The third big bet was that through research and continuous iteration, these new online courses would provide more engaging and effective learning experiences . -> These dramatic changes have not come to pass. If you want to know why. Briefly: Few MOOCs offered an improved pedagogical experience for distance learners (\"most courses simply recorded a professor lecturing, harkening back to the earliest days of motion pictures when the first order of business was the filming of stage plays. \") + old technology (LMS & autograders unable to asses a student's essay) MOOCs have created new opportunities for the already educated and most affluent (financially and academically) learners with strong self-regulated learning skills. We have useful data about how many learners register, what background levels of education they have, what courses they take and complete... But very little has been discovered about how they learn . Reich's Law \u29eb Jokingly summarized, Reich's Law is: People who do stuff do more stuff, and people who do stuff do better than people who don\u2019t do stuff. ( Failure to disrupt , Part I, chapter 1 INSTRUCTOR-GUIDED LEARNING AT SCALE Massive Open Online Courses) Extraordinary claims \ud83d\ude2e \u29eb 2009: high-school courses would be replaced by online options \u2728 \u29eb In 2008, a Harvard Business School professor, Clayton Christensen predicted ( Disrupting class ) that by 2019 , half of all middle and high-school courses would be replaced by online options , and the cost would be one-third of today\u2019s costs , and the courses will be much better . 2011: Sal Kahn reinvent education \u2728 \u29eb Sal Kahn (At some point, Salman Kahn is basically explaining that thanks to videos teachers are kind of obsolete) At the end of the presentation, Bill Gates' conclusion is: \"Well, it's amazing. I think you just got a glimpse of the future of education \". ### 2013: Half the universities would be in bankruptcy \u2728 MOOCs are going to revolutionize education. Because of MOOCs, \"maybe half the universities would be in bankruptcy\" (Clayton Christensen) ### 1994: Videodiscs will revolutionize classrooms \u2728 \"The use of videodiscs in classroom instruction is increasing every year and promises to revolutionize what will happen in the classroom of tomorrow\" (Semrau & Boyer) ### The 1930s: Radios educate everyone \u2728 \u201cWith Radio, the Underprivileged School Becomes the Privileged One.\u201d Teaching Machines: A Brief History of \"Teaching at Scale\" We have not learned from the failure of our past predictions (in fact, wishful thinking continue nowadays! \u2639\ufe0f). ### 1913: Books will be obsolete in schools \u2728 \"Books will soon be obsolete in the public schools. Scholars will be instructed through the eye. It is possible to teach every branch of human knowledge with the motion picture. Our school system will be completely changed inside of ten years.\" Who said that? #### Thomas Edison Interview with Edison published in The New York Dramatic Mirror in July 1913 In education technology, extreme claims are usually the sign of a charlatan rather than an impending breakthrough. ( Failure to disrupt , Part I, chapter 2 ALGORITHM-GUIDED LEARNING AT SCALE Adaptive Tutors and Computer-Assisted Instruction) Why? \u29eb But why these technologies failed to transform education? A few reasons: \u29eb New Technologies, Old Pedagogies Curse of the familiar Matthew Effect Trap of Routine Assessment New Technologies, Old Pedagogies \u29eb New learning technologies rarely innovate on fundamental pedagogical ideas. Remember the MOOC example? (\u261d\ufe0f) LMS Give me date \u29eb When did the first LMS appear? [...] the first LMS appeared in 1924 in the higher education sector, [...] The first introduction of the LMS was in the late 1990s . ( wikipedia ) PLATO \u29eb Have you heard of PLATO? It stands for Programmed Logic for Automatic Teaching Operations . It is a software that provides: lessons forums message boards chat rooms screen sharing multiplayer games emoticons It can: track every keystroke a student made keep data on every answer submitted It allows: students to work at their own pace teachers to create heir own lessons PLATO has been built on the University of Illinois' ILLIAC machine in 1960 . Innovation or old techniques? \u29eb 25:17 Read The Monsters of Education Technology by Audrey Watters : -> Old technologies like PLATO (1960) which shaped our behaviorist computer-aided instruction products. The author insists on this idea: The refrain of this talk: new technologies are easy to develop; new behaviors and new cultures are not. Curse of the familiar \u29eb Easily adopted technologies will be those that replicate existing classroom practices , but digitizing what teachers and students already do is unlikely to lead to substantial improvements in schools. ( Failure to disrupt , Part II, chapter 5 The Curse of the familiar) Even when teachers have adequate support for technology integration, research has shown that adoption of new technologies is a process that usually begins with using new technologies in old ways . ( Failure to disrupt , Part II, chapter 5 The Curse of the familiar) Use of technology in schools: \u29eb entry, adoption, adaptation, appropriation, invention. At early stages, teachers replicated existing practices with technology, and over time, teachers developed approaches to teaching and learning that would be impossible without the new technologies. Scratch Example \u29eb Scratch is designed as the technology avatar and vehicle for constructionist pedagogy, and schools are often successful at neutering those elements of Scratch so that it can be implemented in learning environments emphasizing teacher control and student compliance with specific routines or instructions. ( Failure to disrupt , Part II, chapter 5 The Curse of the familiar) During the pandemic, \"a series of collective act of conservatism\"... \u29eb faced with dramatically changing circumstances, most of the professors walked away from their lectern and sat down in front of their home office video cameras and kept teaching roughly the same way that they were teaching beforehand ( Justin Reich ) ![[Reich.MP4]] Edtech Matthew Effect \u29eb FOR MANY YEARS, educators, designers, and policymakers have hoped that free and low-cost online technologies could bridge the chasm of opportunity that separates more and less affluent students. This dream has proven elusive. ( Failure to disrupt , Part II, chapter 6 The Edtech Matthew Effect) \u201cFor whoever has will be given more, and they will have an abundance. Whoever does not have, even what they have will be taken away from them.\u201d (a verse in the biblical Gospel of Matthew) The edtech Matthew effect posits that this pattern is quite common in the field of education technology and learning at scale. ( Failure to disrupt , Part II, chapter 6 The Edtech Matthew Effect) New resources - even free - are more likely to benefit already affluent learners with access to networked technology and access of networks of people who know how to take advantage of free online resources. Technology reproduces inequalities embedded in systems. The Trap of Routine Assessment \u29eb AUTOGRADERS EXCEL AT assessing routine tasks. These are exactly the kinds of tasks that we no longer need humans to do . ( Failure to disrupt , Part II, chapter 7 The Trap of Routine Assessment) Much of what we can assess at large scale are routine tasks, as opposed to the complex communication and unstructured problem-solving tasks that will define meaningful and valuable human work in the future. Computers can mostly assess what computers are good at doing, and these are things we do not need humans to do in the labor market . ( Failure to disrupt , Part II, chapter 7 The Trap of Routine Assessment) Conclusion \u29eb Schools are complex systems \u29eb Schools are complex system==s, and many stakeholders in school systems \u2014 teachers, students, parents, administrators, and policymaker \u2014 are often quite committed to various aspects of the status quo. The schools that exist today are ==an assemblage of features designed to balance competing visions of the purpose of schooling : inspiring lifelong learning, helping learners pass through gatekeeping exams, preparing people for their lives as citizens. ( Failure to disrupt , Conclusion) Educational systems domesticate new technologies \u29eb new technologies do not disrupt existing educational systems. Rather, existing educational systems domesticate new technologies , and in most cases, they use such technologies in the service of the well-established goals and structures of schools. ( Failure to disrupt , Conclusion) There is hope \u29eb First, change won\u2019t come from heroic developers or even technology firms, but from communities of educators, researchers, and designers oriented toward innovative pedagogy and a commitment to educational equity. We need villages, not heroes . Second, technology won\u2019t transform teaching and learning. Our best hope is that technologies open up new spaces for the work of holistically improving curricula, pedagogy, instructional resources, student support, teacher professional development, policy, and other critical facets of school systems. Technology, at best, has a limited role to play in the broader work of systems change. Finally, we must let go of the hope for the kinds of dramatic shifts that sometimes do happen in consumer technologies and instead envision the work of systems change as a long process of tinkering and continuous improvement. ( Failure to disrupt , Conclusion) Breakthrough on the horizon? \u29eb New technologies won't disrupt and transform educational systems. Things change but they don't change disruptively. They change incrementally . They change step by step. The whole purpose of the book is to inoculate educators from future hype cycles , to convince them that the next time someone comes around and says, \"Oh! it's going to be AR or VR or AI that's going to change everything\", you may say \"well, that's very unlikely to happen\" so we don't spend large resources chasing those products. How AI Adaptive Technology can Upgrade Education Industry - Joleen Liang (sponsored by Squirrel AI) Voir aussi les propos de Derek Li, fondateur de Squirrel AI : \"Yes we will disrupt the education industry\" Helping teachers \u29eb People are fond of pointing out that the nineteenth-century time traveller would be astonished by our banks, factories, and operating theatres \u2013 all transformed by new technology \u2013 while the classroom has hardly changed. However, bankers, industrialists, and surgeons have had huge resources devoted to developing the specialised systems they need for transformation. Teachers have not. Yet it is a much more tractable problem to model the activity that moves a credit from one account to another than to model the activity that moves a mind from confusion to understanding. Governments provide education with the tools developed for industry and commerce, but who is there to help teachers and lecturers work out how to use them to transform teaching and learning?

In every case, the importance of feedback is paramount. You may want to encourage or give them substantial explanations about how to do this and that. During the lockdown, we couldn\u2019t sometimes simply talk to students, sit next to them and give simple and quick advice, but with some apps, it was possible to find powerful and interesting solutions to produce effective and rich feedback. You will find apps and advice on how to help your students, but keep in mind that students can help each other. The document you are reading is divided into three main sections: How to help students in a synchronous way (videoconference for instance). How to help students in an asynchronous way (using Classroom, Google Docs, Flipgrid...) How to foster collaboration between students (in a non-teacher centre approach, you can rely on students to help each other). 1. How to help students in a synchronous way \u29eb Zoom \u29eb It\u2019s easy to set up an appointment with your student and explain whatever you need to explain them. The hours dedicated to what we call \u201cAccompagnement personnalis\u00e9\u201d are great for that, but may not be enough. In fact, it doesn\u2019t have to be long and you could schedule informal chats just to confirm that everything is right or understood. To do that, Calendly is great. All you have to do is provide a link and students choose a slot. So you can have a one-to-one videoconference but be aware of safeguarding issues. We ask, if you do so, to record your session every time you have a meeting with only one student. 2. How to help students in an asynchronous way \u29eb Google Classroom \u29eb Students can (and should) write comments in Google Classroom if they don\u2019t understand something. Say you are posting a new activity or an assignment. If a student needs a little extra help, it may be useless to schedule a meeting and so on. All the student has to do is to write a question. Google Docs \u29eb In order to produce rich feedback, you may use these three Chrome add-ons. For instance, with Text Blaze , you create snippets of comments instead of writing the same thing over and over. You just type a shortcut and voil\u00e0! In my opinion, the main purpose is to create a dialogue between the student and his or her teacher. It is an asynchronous dialogue. Using Mote will allow you to create voice note comments. Don\u2019t forget to turn on Enable voice transcription in settings. You\u2019ll probably want to review and edit your transcript but it\u2019s definitely time-saving anyway! Why writing a long answer to a student\u2019s question when you can record it in a lively and dynamic video? Use Loom to do that. Moreover, Loom is free if you are an educator. Go to Loom for education webpage . PDF \u29eb You may prefer using PDF files you can annotate in Kami for instance or even in Google Classroom. The latter is great for small assessments, the former has more capabilities (markup, comments, shapes, drawing...). Whatever your choice is, PDFs are a little bit like paper. If you have a stylus, it\u2019s easy to grade a digital essay as you would on paper. Flipgrid \u29eb Flipgrid is an app that allows students to record short online videos. A great opportunity to work on oral communication. As a teacher, you can even record an answer, send a private comment, etc. Forster collaboration between your students \u29eb True, teachers can help students making progress, but actually students can help each other. As a matter of fact, giving feedback is not the simple transmission of information from teacher to learner. Students can assess the work of their peers. This could be an ongoing discussion between students, a dialogue like in social media or a forum. Pupils would exchange ideas in order to produce the best work they can. Or they could discuss their feedback and find help on how to integrate comments given by the teacher if they don\u2019t know where to start. Let\u2019s imagine a discussion highlighting these few points: What the teacher said What you could do about it Areas that weren\u2019t commented on What to ask to the teacher You can create some kind of forum so a question (and, of course, your answer) benefits to the entire class. Google Groups is great for that. Get a backchannel with Yoteach . Create your own social media just for your class thanks to Qwiqr . I promise you, you will be amazed by the richness of the exchanges between your students. And it\u2019s delightful to see them helping each other, to take time to share explanations and screenshots and so on.

We have only half an hour to talk about a lot of things -(I\u2019m not going to complain (those of you who presented their favorite apps or something had only 5 minutes)- So let\u2019s get started. You can find this presentation on my Google Classroom. I\u2019ll put the link on the chat as well. Google Slides By the way, I like this cartoon Camie shared. It really shows how different the remote learning experience can be whether you are in secondary or in elementary. We all must have experienced things differently actually. OK. So, you can react, comment, ask a question in this presentation. Don\u2019t hesitate. To give you a quick glance of the content of this presentation, please refer to this slide. Survey Tutorials Zoom Setup Remote learning Learning design The four Cs Pix And let\u2019s start with a quick survey: how are you? Tell me if you\u2019ve been happy with your remote teaching or not. Just drag and drop the happy or sad emojis on the table. If you don\u2019t really know, you have a column in the middle of this table (down below, you\u2019ll find the appropriate emoji). Therefore, we\u2019ll have a quick view of your feelings about remote learning. So, now is the time to explain, to tell me a little bit more about what you think. I made a Google form. Take a moment to have a look. -You can answer later or right now if you want while I speak-. The link will be in the chat as well. Google Forms In the meantime, please remember that I made this Classroom for you and you can find some tutorials like these ones. I hope this is useful. OK. Let\u2019s start with Zoom. I want to be sure that everyone has the latest version of the Zoom client. It\u2019s very important. Every update brings new features and security patches as well. So this is important. Just to check, could someone please fill these two boxes and tell me what is the latest version of Zoom on a computer or an iPad? Speaking of security, we do want to avoid Zoom bombing, do we? So make sure that you visit the zoom.us website, head to the settings section and enable these features. Enable the waiting room and only accept people you can identify. Require a passcode for any meetings. If you have any problem with the chat, disable it (In Meeting (Basic) > Chat) Toggle on \u201cOnly authenticated users can join meetings\u201d (but do not forget to turn it off when parent conferences occur). Last but not least, in the settings again, go to Background & Filters to add a beautiful virtual background. You can upload your own photos. Since very recently, we have the blur option I really like (we add it in Microsoft Teams and Google Meet but until now not in Zoom) And keep in mind you can touch up your appearance too. This is a nice feature. But maybe you will say that I\u2019m vain. To finish this part dedicated to Zoom, I just want to quickly speak about the setup. It occurred to me that if I had to spend so much time on Zoom, I would need to invest a little bit and after some reading, I end up buying a brand new mic and a stand for my phone which I use as a way better camera than the one on my computer. I probably won\u2019t stop here and will buy new toys but you know\u2026 But I really think it improves the Zoom experience. If one day, we are going to offer full online classes, we will have to reflect on that. In addition, listen to the tips provided by this guy. If you play the video, it will start with one I find very useful: look at the people you are talking to. When we speak on Zoom, we are staring at our computer or maybe ourselves but if you want to make this like a live experience, look at the camera. If you want to talk to people, you have to look at the camera. Makes sense? It\u2019s a little awkward. I can\u2019t get used to it but I wanted to share that with you. Now, I\u2019d like to talk more specifically about remote learning. This week I read this article in Medium. The title is Online Learning Is Not The Problem, Bad Design Is and one can read \u201cBefore Claiming That Online Learning Sucks, Remember That Poor Design Leads to Poor Outcomes\u201d. And the word I find very interesting is \u201cdesign\u201d. If we want to be successful in online teaching, we have to /design/ our learning. That\u2019s something I\u2019ve already said in the past but let me insist. Someone who would only talk to the camera, well, it would be like some kind of \u201cpremium [\u2026] YouTube version of education\u201d, which is quite appalling, and that\u2019s not what we want. That\u2019s why we need to design our lessons so that they are more engaging, more efficient. And to do that, well, we\u2019ve got something. We have got the learning designer. Very often, we compare teaching to art and this is pretty relevant for a lot of things. But teachers are, like Diana Laurillard said, more like engineers. \u201cTeachers are [\u2026] more like engineers \u2013 who try to make the world a better place. Like engineers, they use science, where it improves what they do. And like engineers, they use feedback, redesigning their teaching in the light of what happens in practice. \u201cDesign engineers\u201d \u2013 the term suits what teachers actually do.\u201d Indeed, we do make the world a better place. Just have a look at our values. And we use science, we read what the research says. We use feedback from our colleagues, from our students, from parents. So this is true, teachers are like engineers. And according to Diana Laurillard, a well-designed lesson is based on the six learning types . Read/Write/Listen (or Acquisition), Inquiry, Practice, Production, Discussion, Collaboration. In principle, a good learning design will contain a mix of all of these types of learning. And to do that, we have a tool. It\u2019s called the learning designer. It\u2019s a tool that helps you plan your teaching. It does this by asking you to think about the learning experiences you\u2019re planning for your learners [\u2026]. You choose an activity & plan a lesson to teach. You put in some context at the beginning including a title, topic, description, aims and outcomes, how many learners involved. I can link the learning outcomes to Bloom\u2019s taxonomy [\u2026]. I can specify the length of the learning time I am designing for and the tool will automatically calculate how much time I have used. This helps me check I am not planning too much or too little for my learners [...]. So the next thing to do is to start building the details. So I click this button which will add [\u2026] a TLA [\u2026] a set of teaching and learning activities. If you want to know more about the learning designer, you can have a look at this video. Or visit my Classroom, I shared some notes about it. And of course, if you need help, drop me a line, I\u2019ll be happy to assist you in creating your first design. Anyway, what I want you to understand today is that you design your lesson and you end up with nice charts showing you the proportions of your design and then you decide what adjustments you want to make. It\u2019s also a great opportunity to ask yourself if you are promoting a teacher centred model or on the contrary a more constructivist approach. You can also reflect on what is more appropriate: synchronous or asynchronous. I think this is a well-known thing so I won\u2019t develop it and I think we are running out of time. Finally, I want to mention \u201c ABC Learning design on a spreadsheet . It has been made by two friends of mine and this is really a great tool. The learning designer is great but it\u2019s not very convenient to share. You can\u2019t really collaborate on one of your design. Well, with this Spreadsheet it is. This presentation comes to an end. I just want to say before finishing that online learning is a great opportunity to work on the 4 Cs. I was reading /21 lessons for the 21st century/ from Yuval Noah Harari, the author of /Sapiens/. It\u2019s really impressive. In one chapter, he\u2019s talking about education and says that in a world \u201cflooded by enormous amounts of information\u201d, \u201cthe last thing a teacher needs to give her pupils is more information\u201d. So what should we be teaching? Many pedagogical experts argue that schools should switch to teaching \u2018the four Cs\u2019 [\u2026]. The four Cs are: critical thinking, communication, collaboration, creativity And when we read our values, we clearly see that they are made to foster these skills. And it\u2019s a great pleasure to see our students making big creative projects, communicating, collaborating especially when you know that for the first time in history we teach to people who are not in the same room, at the same time, doing the same thing as the rest of the class. So this is quite challenging and fascinating. All right, now I\u2019d like to say a quick word about Pix. As it is intended to French teachers, if you are not and want to leave, feel free to go.

And a tool, a website has been made so you can design your learning using all these types of learning. It\u2019s a simple but very effective way of designing your learning. To start designing your, visit the UCL website. The tool provides feedback on your design by showing you the amount of learning time you have designed, a pie chart of the proportion of each of the six learning types . You decide what adjustments to make. It shows you the proportions of time learners spend online , with the teacher present , and as a class, group or individual . Two friends of mine designed an even more powerful tool. It\u2019s a spreadsheet you can easily share with your colleague to design your teaching. Slide 9 \u29eb The four Cs Often referred as 21st century skills \"So what should we be teaching? Many pedagogical experts argue that schools should switch to teaching \u2018the four Cs\u2019 \u2013 critical thinking, communication, collaboration and creativity.\" (/21 lessons for the 21st century/, Part V: Resilience, EDUCATION) What are the four Cs? critical thinking, communication, collaboration creativity These are the skills every student needs to deal with a world constantly changing. Values of the school \u29eb Through a rigorous, bilingual programme and innovative methods, we educate pupils to become responsible, creative , and principled global citizens. We teach them to think critically and act ethically, to form and express their own opinions and respect those of others, to define their own life goals, and to make sense of and embrace change . I think that remote learning was a great opportunity to develop these skills. The highest level of learning according to Bloom\u2019s Taxonomy is the ability for learners to create. Instead of thinking that the end of a course needs a final exam, we should seek instead to allow opportunities for learners to create something new with the knowledge that was given.

(propos de Nicholas Negroponte, pr\u00e9face) On retrouve cette id\u00e9e chez Sal Kahn (retrouver r\u00e9f\u00e9rence). Avec cette id\u00e9e que l\u2019h\u00e9t\u00e9rog\u00e9n\u00e9it\u00e9 est source de richesse. Usage de la technologie \u29eb R\u00e9flexion int\u00e9ressante sur l\u2019usage de la technologie : Are LCD projectors, laptops and PowerPoint slides education technology? They weren\u2019t designed as such. Laptops were created for rich company executives, Microsoft wrote PowerPoint for corporate presentations, and LCD projectors were invented for corporate boardrooms. Teachers were convinced to adopt this technology at atrocious prices by salespeople from the corporate world who had discovered a new market in schools. Minimally Invasive Education \u29eb J\u2019aime bien l\u2019id\u00e9e \u201cA new idea: Minimally Invasive Education \u201d : We had proof of self-regulated learning, and this time we knew that it could happen anywhere in the world, to any child and in any climate. I decided to call the method of instruction we had developed Minimally Invasive Education (MIE). The rest of the world continues to call it the Hole in the Wall. Lire le chapitre \u201cHow Minimally Invasive Education works\u201d pour voir comment le MIE (Minimally Invasive Education) fonctionne. Par exemple : Children should use the computer in heterogeneous groups. Since the MIE process depends on exploration and discovery, working in groups is essential. Collaborative constructivism is the main paradigm of MIE . Children teach one another very effectively, and they also are highly capable of self-regulating the process. This is the main reason 100 children can use one computer. Et conclusion du chapitre : Minimally Invasive Education for children through kid-friendly public Internet kiosks should form an integral part of primary education in the 21st century. It has the potential not only to rapidly close the digital divide but also to unlock the sort of creative potential for children\u2019s self-development that eminent educationists (those who study the theory of education) have sought to inspire for more than a century. SOLE \u29eb Emma and I created a Self-Organized Learning Environment (SOLE) in a regular classroom. The children worked in groups of three, four or five, and each group had a computer connected to the Internet. They were allowed to talk with one another and to move around and see what other groups were doing. (Remember, we saw in the Hole in the Wall experiment that clustering around a computer is an effective learning strategy for children.)

This was the main mode of transportation for about a couple thousand years. How did it work? You had the coach, you had the horses, you had the coach man, who generally wore some kind of a hat; and then you had the passengers. You went to the coach man and asked him to take you somewhere. You got into the coach and it went and reached wherever you wanted to go. About one hundred years ago, the internal combustion engine got invented and made the horses redundant. We said, \u201cWe can now get rid of the horses because we have the internal combustion engine.\u201d Everybody was happy. You can put away the horses, they don\u2019t have to work so hard anymore. We\u2019ll use a combustion engine to do the work instead. But something else happened which we didn\u00b4t quite expect: the coach man disappeared. Nobody expected that. While the horses were replaced by engines the coach man disappeared and something really strange happened. The passengers became the drivers. This had not happened before. When that happened all sorts of things started to change, because when passengers became drivers they started to invent some really interesting new developments. All of you know these developments; for example, drunken driving, hitting other people, driving on the wrong side of the road, etcetera, etcetera. The entire legal structure, the infrastructure of roads, traffic lights, policemen, licensing authorities, number plates. The coach man went when all those things came in. Automation, to help the passenger drive. [...] The story doesn\u2019t end there. It ends in an even more weird place, because what is happening to the automobile next is something very strange. This year, the first of the actual road trials will begin in the United Kingdom and in the United States. It has been tried for years now: the car that drives itself. The driverless car. You\u2019ll probably see them in two or three years\u2019 time. They\u2019ll probably be quite common. Et plus loin : Now, apply that to education and you are in deep trouble. First of all, you have the teacher leads system\u2014the coach man\u2014where books are the horses. The teacher is the coach man with the passengers in the back. Off we go. Then change to the automobile. The books go away, because they all get interconnected with each other, replaced with the internet. The coach man goes away, because what can the coach man do with the internet? Only the passengers can drive. And then take it to the next step. What if it drove itself? What would that mean? In the case of the car it meant that the idea of driving went away. In the case of education, I am left with no choice but to say the idea of learning has to go away. And you\u2019d say, \u201cThat\u2019s ridiculous, what do you mean? How can learning go away?\u201d I would go one step further. What about knowing? Could we think of a world where knowing is obsolete? Will there one day be grandchildren who will ask their grandfathers \u201cWhat does it mean to know something?\u201d The grandfather will say, \u201cIn order to know something from a very young age you have to go into large rooms, sit in rows, put your finger on your lips, and listen to a person talking for the next twelve years. Then you\u2019ll know.\u201d That grandchild will say, \u201cDon\u2019t be silly.\u201d So not just things, even concepts, can dematerialize.

Collaborative constructivism is the main paradigm of MIE . Children teach one another very effectively, and they also are highly capable of self-regulating the process. This is the main reason 100 children can use one computer.

Diff\u00e9rents \u00e9tats de la connaissance \u29eb Une connaissance peut \u00eatre explicite ou implicite . D\u2019une connaissance implicite, nous pouvons dire que \u00ab je sais ce que c\u2019est \u00bb ou \u00ab je sais le faire \u00bb, mais nous ne savons pas la d\u00e9crire. Une connaissance explicite peut \u00eatre formalis\u00e9e (repr\u00e9sent\u00e9e) selon une ou plusieurs formes (linguistique, alg\u00e9brique, sch\u00e9matique, etc.). Par exemple, nous pouvons repr\u00e9senter le th\u00e9or\u00e8me de Pythagore par une phrase, par une \u00e9quation ou par une figure g\u00e9om\u00e9trique. Une connaissance peut \u00eatre caract\u00e9ris\u00e9e par ses conditions d\u2019utilisation , son domaine de validit\u00e9, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire l\u2019ensemble des crit\u00e8res \u00e0 remplir pour que cette connaissance puisse \u00eatre utilis\u00e9e. Une connaissance \u00eatre caract\u00e9ris\u00e9e par son domaine d\u2019utilisation . Une m\u00eame connaissance peut permettre de r\u00e9aliser plusieurs t\u00e2ches. Une connaissance est le moyen de r\u00e9aliser un certain nombre de t\u00e2ches . Cat\u00e9gorie des connaissances en fonction des t\u00e2ches \u29eb Une connaissance d\u00e9clarative permet la r\u00e9alisation de t\u00e2ches qui concernent la mise en relation des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de l\u2019environnement : par exemple, comprendre un texte, une figure g\u00e9om\u00e9trique, une situation ou un r\u00e9sultat d\u2019exp\u00e9rience. Une connaissance proc\u00e9durale permet la r\u00e9alisation de t\u00e2ches qui concernent la r\u00e9alisation d\u2019une s\u00e9quence d\u2019actions physiques ou d\u2019op\u00e9rations mentales (r\u00e9aliser un passement de jambes au football, r\u00e9soudre une \u00e9quation du second degr\u00e9, r\u00e9parer un pneu crev\u00e9). La plupart des connaissances ont un volet d\u00e9claratif et un volet proc\u00e9dural , elles permettent de r\u00e9aliser des t\u00e2ches qui impliquent la mise en relation d\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ments de l\u2019environnement et aussi des t\u00e2ches qui impliquent la r\u00e9alisation d\u2019une s\u00e9quence d\u2019actions ou d\u2019op\u00e9rations. Les connaissances g\u00e9n\u00e9rales sont mobilisables pour r\u00e9aliser de nombreuses t\u00e2ches diff\u00e9rentes. Les connaissances particuli\u00e8res sont mobilisables pour r\u00e9aliser une t\u00e2che. Six formats de connaissance \u29eb Un concept est une connaissance d\u00e9clarative g\u00e9n\u00e9rale : loi, principe, th\u00e9or\u00e8me . Un concept est reli\u00e9 \u00e0 d\u2019autres concepts. Par exemple, le concept d\u2019\u00e9quilibre en m\u00e9canique est reli\u00e9 aux concepts de force, (d\u2019absence) de mouvement et de rep\u00e8re. Une connaissance sp\u00e9cifique de situation est une connaissance d\u00e9clarative particuli\u00e8re d\u2019un fait, d\u2019une situation, d\u2019un \u00e9tat ponctuel du monde, etc. Une telle connaissance peut exister sans v\u00e9ritable lien avec d\u2019autres connaissances sp\u00e9cifiques. Cette connaissance est parfois d\u00e9sign\u00e9e par les termes de \u00ab mod\u00e8le de situation \u00bb ou \u00ab repr\u00e9sentation mentale \u00bb. Une trace litt\u00e9rale est une connaissance d\u00e9clarative qui correspond exactement, litt\u00e9ralement, \u00e0 la connaissance apprise. C\u2019est en quelque sorte la \u00ab formalisation \u00bb de la connaissance, par opposition \u00e0 son \u00ab contenu \u00bb. Elle ne permet pas de comprendre ni d\u2019agir dans une situation. Une m\u00e9thode est une proc\u00e9dure g\u00e9n\u00e9rale : suite d\u2019actions physiques et/ou d\u2019op\u00e9rations mentales valable (transf\u00e9rable) dans des contextes diff\u00e9rents d\u2019un domaine de connaissances. Ces m\u00e9thodes peuvent avoir comme objectif la compr\u00e9hension (d\u2019un syst\u00e8me, d\u2019une situation) et pas seulement l\u2019action sur eux. Ces m\u00e9thodes sont des strat\u00e9gies m\u00e9tacognitives (des connaissances qui permettent d\u2019organiser l\u2019activit\u00e9 de l\u2019individu). Un savoir-faire est une proc\u00e9dure particuli\u00e8re : s\u00e9quence d\u2019actions physiques et/ou d\u2019op\u00e9rations mentales que l\u2019on est capable de mettre en \u0153uvre de mani\u00e8re contr\u00f4l\u00e9e, dans un contexte particulier. Un automatisme est une proc\u00e9dure particuli\u00e8re dont le d\u00e9clenchement est irr\u00e9pressible et ne peut \u00eatre interrompu. La mise en \u0153uvre d\u2019un automatisme ne n\u00e9cessite pas d\u2019attention. Selon la t\u00e2che que l\u2019on r\u00e9alise avec la connaissance, cette derni\u00e8re est d\u2019un format diff\u00e9rent : concept, repr\u00e9sentation de la situation, trace litt\u00e9rale, m\u00e9thode, savoir-faire, automatisme. Une connaissance est sp\u00e9cifi\u00e9e par des formats de connaissance, comme l\u2019est un d\u00e9 \u00e0 six faces . Couples connaissance/t\u00e2che \u29eb Il est possible de d\u00e9crire des couples selon la connaissance impliqu\u00e9e. Quand la connaissance est un concept, les t\u00e2ches r\u00e9alisables rel\u00e8vent principalement de la compr\u00e9hension. Mais cette compr\u00e9hension peut concerner un ensemble tr\u00e8s grand, voire infini, de situations des plus abstraites et g\u00e9n\u00e9rales aux plus concr\u00e8tes et particuli\u00e8res. Quand la connaissance est sp\u00e9cifique, les t\u00e2ches rel\u00e8vent de la compr\u00e9hension de situations analogues avec la situation, sources de la connaissance. Quand la connaissance est une trace litt\u00e9rale, les t\u00e2ches rel\u00e8vent de la restitution litt\u00e9rale, mais aussi de la reconnaissance : ce que je ne comprenais pas mais savais par c\u0153ur peut prendre sens dans une situation particuli\u00e8re. Car j\u2019ai identifi\u00e9 que cette connaissance est pertinente dans cette situation. Quand la connaissance est une m\u00e9thode, les t\u00e2ches sont en tr\u00e8s grand nombre, elles rel\u00e8vent de l\u2019action sur le monde, cette action pouvant consister \u00e0 agir directement mais aussi diagnostiquer, \u00e9valuer, pr\u00e9parer une intervention, etc. Quand la connaissance est un savoir-faire, les t\u00e2ches rel\u00e8vent de la mise en \u0153uvre de proc\u00e9dures dans des situations analogues avec la situation, sources de la connaissance. Quand la connaissance est un automatisme, les t\u00e2ches rel\u00e8vent de la m\u00eame cat\u00e9gorie que pour les savoir-faire. Ce qui caract\u00e9rise l\u2019automatisme r\u00e9side dans la fr\u00e9quence de la t\u00e2che : si une m\u00eame t\u00e2che est r\u00e9alis\u00e9e fr\u00e9quemment avec la m\u00eame connaissance, cette derni\u00e8re va devenir un automatisme.

Cela a \u00e9t\u00e9 vrai au d\u00e9but du XXe si\u00e8cle apr\u00e8s la Premi\u00e8re Guerre mondiale. Cela l'\u00e9tait d\u00e9j\u00e0 au sortir du Moyen \u00e2ge lorsque l'homme retrouve sa vraie place dans un monde scl\u00e9ros\u00e9. Cela l'est encore dans un monde organisant sur les r\u00e9seaux sociaux des manifestations proclamant la mort des valeurs colonialistes (statues tomb\u00e9es de leur pied d'estal), revendiquant l'\u00e9galit\u00e9 de tous (black lives matter), pr\u00f4nant plus de d\u00e9mocratie (\u00e9v\u00e9nements \u00e0 Hong Kong).

L\u2019humaniste est un passionn\u00e9 de technique : \u00ab Tous ces \u00e9diteurs humanistes ne sont pas uniquement des savants soucieux de multiplier des textes corrects et de faire \u0153uvre personnelle.

Aide, nous l\u2019avons vu, fait tailler des caract\u00e8res grecs plus lisibles et plus \u00e9l\u00e9gants que ceux que l\u2019on employait jusque-l\u00e0 et il \u00ab lance \u00bb l\u2019italique. Les imprimeurs humanistes, en cette \u00e9poque, bouleversent la pr\u00e9sentation du livre imprim\u00e9 qu\u2019ils rendent plus claire. Les Estienne savent donner \u00e0 leurs pages de titre une sobri\u00e9t\u00e9 harmonieuse. Certains imprimeurs humanistes se soucient plus \u2013 tant est grand leur amour du m\u00e9tier \u2013 de la forme que du fond. \u00bb (/L\u2019Apparition du livre/) Un monde en transformation \u29eb De m\u00eame qu\u2019internet (arpanet) s\u2019est d\u00e9velopp\u00e9 dans les universit\u00e9s (connectant les universit\u00e9s. Voir The Innovators & Culture num\u00e9rique), de m\u00eame le livre et son besoin sont n\u00e9s dans les universit\u00e9s qui apparaissent \u00e0 la fin du XIIe, d\u00e9but XIIIe. \u00ab Pour pr\u00e9parer leurs cours, les professeurs vont avoir besoin de textes, d\u2019ouvrages de r\u00e9f\u00e9rence, de commentaires. (On sait l\u2019importance que tient dans l\u2019enseignement m\u00e9di\u00e9val la glose, la discussion, le commentaire d\u2019un texte faisant autorit\u00e9, et cela dans tous les domaines de la connaissance.) \u00bb Comme lors du passage du Moyen \u00c2ge \u00e0 la Renaissance, la transformation des usages s\u2019accompagne d\u2019une m\u00e9fiance. Comme aujourd\u2019hui se d\u00e9veloppent des discours anti-\u00e9crans en tout genre, hier avait-on une m\u00e9fiance \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des nouveaux supports. Ainsi au sortir du Moyen \u00c2ge, le papier : \u00ab On utilise parfois cette nouvelle mati\u00e8re dans les chancelleries, mais la crainte de voir se d\u00e9truire cette substance inconnue et d\u2019apparence fragile incite les souverains \u00e0 en proscrire l\u2019emploi dans la r\u00e9daction des chartes : d\u00e8s 1145, le roi Roger ordonne que tous les dipl\u00f4mes r\u00e9dig\u00e9s sur \u00ab carta cuttanea \u00bb au temps de ses pr\u00e9d\u00e9cesseurs, soient recopi\u00e9s sur parchemin puis d\u00e9truits. En 1231 encore, l\u2019empereur Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric II d\u00e9fend d\u2019utiliser le papier dans la r\u00e9daction des actes publics \u00bb (/L\u2019Apparition du livre/) \u00ab Bien plus, depuis pr\u00e8s d\u2019un demi-si\u00e8cle, les derniers pr\u00e9jug\u00e9s contre le papier achevaient de dispara\u00eetre. Longtemps, les manuscrits avaient continu\u00e9 d\u2019\u00eatre transcrits sur parchemin par les \u00e9tudiants et les copistes. Routine ? Certes, mais aussi d\u00e9sir d\u2019employer une mati\u00e8re solide et \u00e9prouv\u00e9e pour assurer aux textes de plus grandes chances de dur\u00e9e \u00bb (/L\u2019Apparition du livre/) Et comme les usages de l\u2019informatique peuvent le montrer, l\u2019histoire de son adoption et de son lent perfectionnement permettant de p\u00e9n\u00e9trer tous les march\u00e9s et d\u2019ainsi favoriser son appropriation est un processus qui prend des d\u00e9cennies voire des si\u00e8cles. Rappelons que l\u2019ordinateur nait au XIXe si\u00e8cle avec la machine de Charles Babbage. Ada Lovelace est la premi\u00e8re \u00e0 en percevoir les possibilit\u00e9s. Les ann\u00e9es 40 et 50 concr\u00e9tisent cette vision. Il faudra attendre les ann\u00e9es 70 pour que l\u2019ordinateur personnel commence \u00e0 devenir un d\u00e9sir sur le point d\u2019\u00eatre concr\u00e9tis\u00e9. Ainsi le papier tel que nous le connaissons est un support qui a atteint sa pleine maturit\u00e9, la forme id\u00e9al que nous lui connaissons que vers la fin du XIXe si\u00e8cle. Auparavant, rare, cher, sa mati\u00e8re est le chiffon. Il faudra attendre le d\u00e9but du XVIIIe pour que l\u2019on commence \u00e0 fabriquer du papier \u00e0 partir du bois. Ce n\u2019est que fin XIXe que la chiffe est abandonn\u00e9e. L\u2019histoire de ce long perfectionnement doit nous rappeler qu\u2019une technique peut appara\u00eetre t\u00f4t et se d\u00e9velopper sur des distances que l\u2019on voit se raccourcir aujourd\u2019hui (il n\u2019est que de se rappeler combien rapidement les vaccins ont \u00e9t\u00e9 produits durant la pand\u00e9mie). Mais \u00e0 qui se dirait que l\u2019adoption des ordinateurs est un processus long, on rappellera qu\u2019en effet si l\u2019on remonte au Plan informatique pour tous datant de 1985 et que certains appellent encore et toujours \u00e0 d\u00e9brancher les \u00e9coles, pr\u00e8s d\u2019un demi-si\u00e8cle n\u2019a pas suffi \u00e0 faire changer les esprits. S\u2019ils semblent changer moins vite que les techniques (loi de Moore), ils font preuve d\u2019une r\u00e9ticence qu\u2019on a pu conna\u00eetre au XVe si\u00e8cle quand les livres \u00e9taient vus d\u2019un mauvais \u0153il M\u00eame histoire de d\u00e9mocratisation : d\u2019abord r\u00e9serv\u00e9 \u00e0 une client\u00e8le ais\u00e9e, il finit par se r\u00e9pandre et m\u00eame \u00e0 se miniaturiser \u00ab Cependant, gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 l\u2019imprimerie et \u00e0 la multiplication des textes, le livre cesse d\u2019appara\u00eetre comme un objet pr\u00e9cieux que l\u2019on consulte dans une biblioth\u00e8que : on souhaite de plus en plus pouvoir l\u2019emporter avec soi et le transporter facilement afin de le consulter ou de le lire partout et \u00e0 toute heure.

Comme aujourd\u2019hui se d\u00e9veloppent des discours anti-\u00e9crans en tout genre, hier avait-on une m\u00e9fiance \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des nouveaux supports. Ainsi au sortir du Moyen \u00c2ge, le papier : \u00ab On utilise parfois cette nouvelle mati\u00e8re dans les chancelleries, mais la crainte de voir se d\u00e9truire cette substance inconnue et d\u2019apparence fragile incite les souverains \u00e0 en proscrire l\u2019emploi dans la r\u00e9daction des chartes : d\u00e8s 1145, le roi Roger ordonne que tous les dipl\u00f4mes r\u00e9dig\u00e9s sur \u00ab carta cuttanea \u00bb au temps de ses pr\u00e9d\u00e9cesseurs, soient recopi\u00e9s sur parchemin puis d\u00e9truits. En 1231 encore, l\u2019empereur Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric II d\u00e9fend d\u2019utiliser le papier dans la r\u00e9daction des actes publics \u00bb (/L\u2019Apparition du livre/) \u00ab Bien plus, depuis pr\u00e8s d\u2019un demi-si\u00e8cle, les derniers pr\u00e9jug\u00e9s contre le papier achevaient de dispara\u00eetre. Longtemps, les manuscrits avaient continu\u00e9 d\u2019\u00eatre transcrits sur parchemin par les \u00e9tudiants et les copistes. Routine ? Certes, mais aussi d\u00e9sir d\u2019employer une mati\u00e8re solide et \u00e9prouv\u00e9e pour assurer aux textes de plus grandes chances de dur\u00e9e \u00bb (/L\u2019Apparition du livre/) Et comme les usages de l\u2019informatique peuvent le montrer, l\u2019histoire de son adoption et de son lent perfectionnement permettant de p\u00e9n\u00e9trer tous les march\u00e9s et d\u2019ainsi favoriser son appropriation est un processus qui prend des d\u00e9cennies voire des si\u00e8cles. Rappelons que l\u2019ordinateur nait au XIXe si\u00e8cle avec la machine de Charles Babbage. Ada Lovelace est la premi\u00e8re \u00e0 en percevoir les possibilit\u00e9s. Les ann\u00e9es 40 et 50 concr\u00e9tisent cette vision. Il faudra attendre les ann\u00e9es 70 pour que l\u2019ordinateur personnel commence \u00e0 devenir un d\u00e9sir sur le point d\u2019\u00eatre concr\u00e9tis\u00e9. Ainsi le papier tel que nous le connaissons est un support qui a atteint sa pleine maturit\u00e9, la forme id\u00e9al que nous lui connaissons que vers la fin du XIXe si\u00e8cle. Auparavant, rare, cher, sa mati\u00e8re est le chiffon. Il faudra attendre le d\u00e9but du XVIIIe pour que l\u2019on commence \u00e0 fabriquer du papier \u00e0 partir du bois. Ce n\u2019est que fin XIXe que la chiffe est abandonn\u00e9e. L\u2019histoire de ce long perfectionnement doit nous rappeler qu\u2019une technique peut appara\u00eetre t\u00f4t et se d\u00e9velopper sur des distances que l\u2019on voit se raccourcir aujourd\u2019hui (il n\u2019est que de se rappeler combien rapidement les vaccins ont \u00e9t\u00e9 produits durant la pand\u00e9mie). Mais \u00e0 qui se dirait que l\u2019adoption des ordinateurs est un processus long, on rappellera qu\u2019en effet si l\u2019on remonte au Plan informatique pour tous datant de 1985 et que certains appellent encore et toujours \u00e0 d\u00e9brancher les \u00e9coles, pr\u00e8s d\u2019un demi-si\u00e8cle n\u2019a pas suffi \u00e0 faire changer les esprits. S\u2019ils semblent changer moins vite que les techniques (loi de Moore), ils font preuve d\u2019une r\u00e9ticence qu\u2019on a pu conna\u00eetre au XVe si\u00e8cle quand les livres \u00e9taient vus d\u2019un mauvais \u0153il M\u00eame histoire de d\u00e9mocratisation : d\u2019abord r\u00e9serv\u00e9 \u00e0 une client\u00e8le ais\u00e9e, il finit par se r\u00e9pandre et m\u00eame \u00e0 se miniaturiser \u00ab Cependant, gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 l\u2019imprimerie et \u00e0 la multiplication des textes, le livre cesse d\u2019appara\u00eetre comme un objet pr\u00e9cieux que l\u2019on consulte dans une biblioth\u00e8que : on souhaite de plus en plus pouvoir l\u2019emporter avec soi et le transporter facilement afin de le consulter ou de le lire partout et \u00e0 toute heure.

And what I found out made me devised new ways of helping students with new apps (at least, they were new to me). I hope you will find this useful. So, we want students to get rid of words such as \u201clike\u201d, \u201chum\u201d, \u201cok\u201d, etc. We would like them to be aware of what they say and how they say it. To do that, I suggest we ask students to use Flipgrid, Google Docs or Otter. Flipgrid \u29eb Ask students to record themselves using Flipgrid . Then, they can create a transcription (using another app. More on that down below). They edit the transcript (spelling, punctuation\u2026) They remove filler words such as \u201clike\u201d or \u201cok\u201d. Then, they redo the recording following the script. Finally, they should be able to record a video without the script (optional). To convert a video to text, you may want to use \u29eb Video to text converter (It\u2019s free but the website doesn\u2019t accept the .mov format you get when you make a screen recording with the iPad. If you need to convert your video so that it is accepted by Video to text converter , visit Online Converter ). veed.io (this is not entirely free but there is a free plan: you can import a video of ten minutes and the transcription can only be exported to the srt format. See Pricing ). Or you can try the powerful Speech to Text from IBM. Google Docs \u29eb Alternatively, students could record their voice using Google Docs (with Google Chrome only: Tools > Voice typing ) and then delete all the filler words they are using when speaking orally. Otter \u29eb Or you can use Otter which makes a very good job at transcribing your voice. Otter turns your voice conversations into smart notes that you can easily search and share. You can use it to take notes at your meetings and interviews, capture your thoughts and ideas while you\u2019re driving in the car, and transcribe your existing recordings and podcasts. You can even snap photos (e.g. of a whiteboard, a speaker, or presentation slide at an event) during a recording and they will be inserted inline with your transcripts. The possibilities are endless! What is Otter? Indeed, you could use Otter to record your Zoom meetings so that students who struggle to understand a foreign language can find some extra help. Having a Zoom videoconference with your students? Consider using Otter which provide a real-time transcript so students don\u2019t have to take notes and can keep focused on what you say. Transcribing your Zoom meeting can also help those that are deaf or hard of hearing. If you want to know how to use Otter, please watch this video . Basically, you just launch Zoom and Otter simultaneously and you will get a pretty accurate transcript of your meeting. Unfortunately, students can\u2019t do the same with their iPad because of iPad OS limitations. One would have thought you could use both Zoom and Otter thanks to Split-View on your iPad but you can\u2019t (in fact, you can but it won\u2019t record your Zoom meeting). But maybe, if you are an English teacher (Otter works only in English), you could do the work for your students. Provided you are working with a laptop or any computer, you can record your meeting. Then, the magic appears. Students can listen to the recording, get the transcript, edit the text, highlight some excerpts they find important, insert images, share the document. In addition, Otter adds a date and useful tags showing the most important notions. In fact, you could also ask students to watch a YouTube video and to generate a transcript with Otter. And that is feasible on an iPad. I tried several times with this video and this other one with Yuval Noah Harari and it works perfectly well. You can even get a shared link and share the recording with your classmates . And of course, you can add comments!

One useful tool for self-practice is the closed captioning option within Google Slides. Students can practice presenting their Slides presentation while it uses the computer\u2019s microphone to record the student\u2019s voice and then Slides transcribes the voice in real time to appear as captions on the slides so students can visualize what they are actually saying. This tool is very useful for editing filler words such as \u201clike\u201d, \u201cum\u201d, \u201cokay\u201d, etc. Additionally, video recording can be used for both self-practice and interactive practice. Once students have video recorded their presentation, they can upload it to Google Drive. Through Google Drive, not only can the video be easily shared with viewers, but students can receive targeted feedback by viewers adding comments and questions as they watch the recording. Another tool that allows students to post videos and receive easy feedback is YouTube. When using YouTube students can send their video to viewers that they want feedback from and they can post feedback in the comments section. When using Google Drive and YouTube to post videos online, be sure to teach students how to set videos to unlisted and to only share with the people that are going to be providing feedback.","title":"One way to improve your students\u2019 oral skills & Otter, a lovely app"},{"location":"Documentation/One%20way%20to%20improve%20your%20students%E2%80%99%20oral%20skills%20%26%20Otter%2C%20a%20lovely%20app/#flipgrid","text":"Ask students to record themselves using Flipgrid .

One useful tool for self-practice is the closed captioning option within Google Slides. Students can practice presenting their Slides presentation while it uses the computer\u2019s microphone to record the student\u2019s voice and then Slides transcribes the voice in real time to appear as captions on the slides so students can visualize what they are actually saying. This tool is very useful for editing filler words such as \u201clike\u201d, \u201cum\u201d, \u201cokay\u201d, etc. Additionally, video recording can be used for both self-practice and interactive practice. Once students have video recorded their presentation, they can upload it to Google Drive. Through Google Drive, not only can the video be easily shared with viewers, but students can receive targeted feedback by viewers adding comments and questions as they watch the recording. Another tool that allows students to post videos and receive easy feedback is YouTube. When using YouTube students can send their video to viewers that they want feedback from and they can post feedback in the comments section. When using Google Drive and YouTube to post videos online, be sure to teach students how to set videos to unlisted and to only share with the people that are going to be providing feedback.","title":"\u00c0 r\u00e9utiliser (provient de Google Advanced training)"},{"location":"Documentation/Otter/","tags":["documentation","Otter"],"text":"Otter First mentioned in One way to improve your students\u2019 oral skills & Otter, a lovely app (the goal was to help students by providing a transcription of the Zoom meeting) but it occurred to us that this could be handy for HOD when interviewing candidates.

The list is not exhaustive and I would appreciate if you could share your needs and say: \"Hey! Why don't we learn this or that?\" I would be happy to prepare new trainings. But, first of all, I would like to help teachers become Apple teachers and therefore help them to master the core apps you need to know to become one (Pages, Keynote, GarageBand and so on). To do that, we will have four sessions dedicated to that goal. Click on the link to register. Day 1 Discover Pages and create ePubs (digital books) Day 2 Discover Keynote and create beautiful presentations Day 3 Discover GarageBand to record audiobooks and more Day 4 Discover iMovie to edit your films Then, I would like to offer a weekly session. Just register on my calendar . Of course I'm keen to offer additional and even individual sessions at any time. Just ask! Down below, you will find a list of all the training I have in mind. I hope you will find it interesting. Again feel free to suggest your ideas. This list is made of some of the training I have already done. Some elements of this list are just articles I have written and that I am willing to transmogrify into workshops. Some of them need to be refined. So still lots of work but that's a start. Thank you.

Introduction to Learning Design The SAMR MODEL \u29eb To enhancement to transformation Link How to Apply the SAMR Model with Ruben Puentedura \u29eb SAMR Model: A Practical Guide for EdTech Integration \u29eb The SAMR Model is a framework created by Dr. Ruben Puentedura that categorizes four different degrees of classroom technology integration . The letters \"SAMR\" stand for Substitution, Augmentation, Modification, and Redefinition . Source de l'article \u00e0 retrouver : Substitution \u29eb At this stage, technology is directly substituted for a more traditional one. It is a simple, bare-bones, direct replacement. For example, if you are teaching a government lesson on the Constitution, you might use an electronic or web-based version of the document instead of a hard copy . Students might also answer questions about the Constitution using a Microsoft Word instead of filling out a worksheet. Substitution might also include a student using Keynote, PowerPoint, Prezi, Slides , or a similar program to present information about an article or amendment to the class. In this step, you ask yourself what we stand to gain by replacing traditional tools with technology. Invariably, some situations will be better served with pen and paper. Augmentation \u29eb The technology is again directly substituted for a traditional one, but with significant enhancements to the student experience. In other words, you ask yourself if the technology increases or augments a student's productivity and potential in some way. Returning to the Constitution example, a student might augment a presentation on, say, the 14th Amendment with a video clip of how equal protection under the law was enforced during school desegregation. It could also include interactive links to relevant supreme court decisions, such as Plessy v. Ferguson or Brown v. Topeka Board of Education. Modification \u29eb In this stage, you are beginning to move from enhancement to transformation on the model. Instead of replacement or enhancement, this is an actual change to the design of the lesson and its learning outcome. The key question here\u2014does the technology significantly alter the task? A student presenting research on the 14th Amendment, to continue our example, might create his or her own unique graphic organizer for the class that not only includes the usual multimedia resources but represents a new product or synthesis of existing material. As another example, a group of students might collaborate in a cloud-based workspace to propose a modern definition of equal protection under the law and solicit feedback on their proposals from classmates. Redefinition \u29eb The last stage of the SAMR model is Redefinition and represents the pinnacle of how technology can transform a student\u2019s experience . In this case, you ask yourself if the technology tools allow educators to redefine a traditional task in a way that would not be possible without the tech, creating a novel experience. For example, after completing their group work and soliciting feedback from classmates (both tasks that could be completed \"offline\" although arguably not with the same experience as in the modified format), students could utilize technology to network with students several states away to see how regional differences impact how others think about the Constitution. Taking it a step further, students could even interact in real time with citizens in another country to examine key differences in constitutional philosophy and law. This can bridge the gap between K-12 and higher education as it did in this digital citizenship project . SAMR and Bloom\u2019s Taxonomy \u29eb Bloom\u2019s Taxonomy Many educators use the SAMR model and Bloom\u2019s Taxonomy in tandem to make their technology integration more purposeful. It\u2019s a common mistake , however, to conflate the two models and think that deeper technology integration (the M and R in SAMR) lead to higher order thinking skills defined by Bloom. This is simply not the case. So while it may be useful to use SAMR and Bloom\u2019s Taxonomy to better flesh out your instructional strategy, keep in mind that they were designed for very different purposes.

Teachers want to use videos to flip the classroom. \"What I do is assign the lectures for homework, and what used to be homework, I know have the students doing in the classroom.\" \"this is the unintuitive thing when you talk about technology in the classroom. By removing the one-size-fits-all lecture from the classroom and letting students have a self-paced lecture at home, and then we you go to the classroom, letting them to work, having the teacher walk around, having the peers actually be able to interact with each other, these teachers have used technology to humanize the classroom. They took a fundamentally dehumanizing experience \u2014 a bunch of 30 kids with their fingers on their lips, not allowed to interact with each other\" Explains what is the Kahn Academy... \"our goal is to use technology to humanize, not just in Los Altos, but on a global scale, what's happening in education\" \"what you'll see emerging is this notion of a global one-world classroom\" Bill Gates' conclusion: \"Well, it's amazing. I think you just got a glimpse of the future of education\" Extrait de Failure to Disrupt \u29eb Millions of people have watched Khan\u2019s two TED talks, but I suspect that far fewer have read his 2019 interview with District Administration, a trade magazine for school superintendents and central office staff. \u201cNow that I run a school,\u201d he told the interviewer, \u201cI see that some of the stuff is not as easy to accomplish compared to how it sounds theoretically.\u201d Khan\u2019s recommendations in 2019 focused less on disruptive transformations of math education and more on using Khan Academy as a modest supplement to traditional classroom instruction : \u201cMore recently, we\u2019re seeing that if students put 30 minutes to an hour per week\u2014or one class period per week\u2014toward software-based, self-paced learning, schools will see a 20 to 30 percent greater-than-expected gain on state assessments. That\u2019s exciting because that\u2019s a dosage that\u2019s very doable in mainstream classrooms. We tell schools to give students 30 to 60 minutes of Khan Academy per week, with teachers doing traditional curriculum four days per week.\u201d When Khan\u2019s soaring vision met the complex reality of schools, disruption and transformation gave way to accommodation. The blended model that Khan espoused in District Administration is actually at least twenty-five years old. In 1997, Ken Koedinger and colleagues published \u201cIntelligent Tutoring Goes to the Big City,\u201d a report describing the use of adaptive, self-paced algebra tutoring software in the Pittsburgh public schools. Students learned in traditional settings for most of their class time and then spent about one day a week using math tutoring software, which led to improvements on math tests similar to what Khan would find decades later. Much of what Khan Academy discovered by 2019 about computer-assisted math instruction, after more than $100 million in philanthropic investment, could have been found in academic papers published in the 1990s. ( Failure to disrupt, Why Technology Alone Can't Transform Education By Justin Reich) One Man, One Computer, 10 Million Students: How Khan Academy Is Reinventing Education How Khan Academy Is Changing the Rules of Education Lire Sal Khan envisions a future of active, mastery-based learning disruption and transformation gave way to accommodation : More recently, we\u2019re seeing that if students put 30 minutes to an hour per week\u2014or one class period per week\u2014toward software-based, self-paced learning, schools will see a 20 to 30 percent greater-than-expected gain on state assessments. That\u2019s exciting because that\u2019s a dosage that\u2019s very doable in mainstream classrooms. We tell schools to give students 30 to 60 minutes of Khan Academy per week, with teachers doing traditional curriculum four days per week. You\u2019re going to see a pretty dramatic improvement. You\u2019ll get the best of both worlds. Extrait de Teaching Machine \u29eb There\u2019s at least one problem with the way Khan tells it: the history is all wrong. Despite Khan\u2019s claim in his TED Talk that to \u201cuse video to reinvent education\u201d is a novel idea, classrooms have been using film for over one hundred years. The History of Education \u29eb Transcript: Sal Khan's History of Education The Oneworld Schoolhouse: Education reimagined \u29eb Art & science \u29eb I passionately believe that the Khan Academy is a tool that can empower at least an approximate model of what the future of education should look like\u2014a way of combining the art of teaching with the science of presenting information and analyzing data , of delivering the clearest, most comprehensive, and most relevant curriculum at the lowest possible cost. I believed, and still believe, that teaching is a separate skill\u2014in fact, an art that is creative, intuitive, and highly personal. But it isn\u2019t only an art. It has, or should have, some of the rigor of science as well . I felt that I could experiment with different techniques to see what worked and what didn\u2019t [...] M\u00e9thode \u29eb I wanted to be a tutor who genuinely shared his thinking and expressed it in a conversational style , as if I was speaking to an equal who was fundamentally smart but just didn\u2019t fully understand the material at hand. Unfortunately, however, the idea that smaller classes alone will magically solve the problem of students being left behind is a fallacy. It ignores several basic facts about how people actually learn. People learn at different rates . Some people seem to catch on to things in quick bursts of intuition; others grunt and grind their way toward comprehension. From the teacher\u2019s perspective, what\u2019s going on is a helping relationship; but from the student\u2019s point of view, it\u2019s difficult if not impossible to avoid an element of confrontation . A question is asked; an answer is expected immediately; that brings pressure. The student doesn\u2019t want to disappoint the teacher. She fears she will be judged. And all these factors interfere with the student\u2019s ability to fully concentrate on the matter at hand. Even more, students are embarrassed to communicate what they do and do not understand. About the use of the blackboard: What better way, graphically, to suggest this than by showing problems and solutions seeming to emerge from the void? Knowledge brought light out of darkness . If attention lasted ten or fifteen minutes , why did it remain a given that class periods were an hour? It was partly for this reason \u2014 and not because of some preexisting theory \u2014 that I decided that I would never be pictured in the lessons. I didn\u2019t at the time own a suitable video camera, and I didn\u2019t want to buy one. It seemed like a slippery slope. If I had a camera, I would have to worry about the lighting. If I had good lighting, I would have to give thought to what I was wearing and whether I had spinach in my teeth. The danger was that the whole process would become more like making movies than tutoring students . Tutoring is intimate . You talk with someone, not at someone. I wanted students to feel like they were sitting next to me at the kitchen table, elbow to elbow, working out problems together. I didn\u2019t want to appear as a talking head at a blackboard, lecturing from across the room. So it was determined that students would never see me but only hear my voice, while the visuals would be nothing except my scrawls (and occasional historic images) on the black electronic chalkboard. So if faces are so important to human beings, why exclude them from videos? Because they are a powerful distraction from the concepts being discussed. [...] Put a face in the same frame as an equation, and the eye will bounce back and forth between the two . In a traditional classroom, expectations of teachers are far too low. A student could pass with 70 percent (which meant there was almost one-third of the material that you didn't know). Ten right answers in a row are expected: My reasoning was that if students could correctly solve ten consecutive problems on a given subject, it was a good indication that they truly understood the underlying concept. active versus passive learning The expression \"work at his or her own pace\" (or \"self-paced learning\") is often use. Find some examples. The Prussian Model \u29eb Pour Kahn, notre mod\u00e8le \u00e9ducatif a \u00e9t\u00e9 invent\u00e9 dans la Prusse du 18e si\u00e8cle. To those not in the field, it may come as a surprise to learn that all these then-radical innovations in what we now call K-12 education were first put in place in eighteenth-century Prussia. Prussia\u2014with its stiff whiskers, stiff hats, and stiff way of marching in lockstep\u2014is where our basic classroom model was invented. Compulsory, tax-supported public education was seen as a political at least as much as a pedagogical tool, and no apology was made for this. The idea was not to produce independent thinkers, but to churn out loyal and tractable citizens who would learn the value of submitting to the authority of parents, teachers, church, and, ultimately, king. Philosophe prussien \u00e0 l'origine de ce mod\u00e8le : Johann Gottlieb Fichte, En lisant Kahn, on n'est pas loin de la th\u00e9orie du complot : It was not by accident that whole ideas were broken up into fragmented \u201csubjects.\u201d Subjects could be learned by rote memorization, whereas mastering larger ideas called for free and unbridled thinking. Similarly, according to Gatto, our sacred notion of the \u201cclass period\u201d was put in place \u201cso that self-motivation to learn would be muted by ceaseless interruptions.\u201d Mais Kahn ajoute : Now, I don\u2019t personally believe that the Prussian system was designed purely as a tool for subjugation to the will of a ruling class. Et conclut plus loin : Today\u2019s world needs a workforce of creative, curious, and self-directed lifelong learners who are capable of conceiving and implementing novel ideas. Unfortunately, this is the type of student that the Prussian model actively suppresses. L'ensemble reste cependant int\u00e9ressant et conclut \u00e0 l'injustice du syst\u00e8me : If you didn\u2019t look too closely \u2014 if you factored out things like family wealth and political connections and the wherewithal to hire private tutors\u2014the system could pass for a meritocracy. Il y revient dans un autre chapitre : Could people actually learn twice as much as was generally expected of them? It seemed ambitious\u2026 but why not? As we saw in the discussion of the Prussian roots of our school system, the original aim of educators was not necessarily to produce the smartest students possible, but to turn out tractable and standardized citizens, workers who knew enough. To this end, attention was given not to what students could learn, but to the bare minimum of what they had to learn. Now, I am not imputing such Machiavellian motives to contemporary educators; but I am suggesting that some of the habits and assumptions that have come down from the eighteenth-century model still steer and limit what students learn. Conventional curricula don\u2019t only tell students where to start; they tell students where to stop. A series of lessons ends; that subject is over. Why aren\u2019t students encouraged to go farther and deeper\u2014to learn twice as much? Probably for the same reason we consider 70 percent a passing grade. Our standards are too low. We\u2019re so squeamish and embarrassed about the very notion of \u201cfailure\u201d that we end up diluting and devaluing the idea of success. We limit what students believe they can do by selling short what we expect them to do.","title":"Sal Kahn"},{"location":"Documentation/Sal%20Kahn/#lets-use-video-to-reinvent-education","text":"\"Let\u2019s Use Video to Reinvent Education\" (Salman Kahn) At some point, Kahn explains that thanks to videos teachers are kind of obsolete. \"They (his cousin) told me that they preferred me on YouTube than in person\" -> laughter \"they can cause and repeat their cousin without feeling like tey're wasting my time\" \"they can watch at their own time and pace\" \"Probably the least-appreciated aspect of this is the notion that the very first time that you're trying to get your brain around a new concept, the very last thing you need is another human being saying \"Do you understand this?\"\" Boasting about the variety of the audience (a boy with autism, young people enjoying math for the very first time)...

By removing the one-size-fits-all lecture from the classroom and letting students have a self-paced lecture at home, and then we you go to the classroom, letting them to work, having the teacher walk around, having the peers actually be able to interact with each other, these teachers have used technology to humanize the classroom.

We tell schools to give students 30 to 60 minutes of Khan Academy per week, with teachers doing traditional curriculum four days per week.\u201d When Khan\u2019s soaring vision met the complex reality of schools, disruption and transformation gave way to accommodation. The blended model that Khan espoused in District Administration is actually at least twenty-five years old. In 1997, Ken Koedinger and colleagues published \u201cIntelligent Tutoring Goes to the Big City,\u201d a report describing the use of adaptive, self-paced algebra tutoring software in the Pittsburgh public schools. Students learned in traditional settings for most of their class time and then spent about one day a week using math tutoring software, which led to improvements on math tests similar to what Khan would find decades later. Much of what Khan Academy discovered by 2019 about computer-assisted math instruction, after more than $100 million in philanthropic investment, could have been found in academic papers published in the 1990s.

Through SELFIE, we know that we can improve things like data protection, safer use of the internet, and social networks. We also need to boost the confidence of teachers with more training and support in using technology. If you would like to know how it works, please have a look at How SELFIE works . It uses questionnaires to collect the views of school leaders, teachers and students, on an anonymous and voluntary basis, and compiles the results in an interactive report that can identify strengths and weaknesses. SELFIE can be taken every year to enable a school to monitor its progress over time and can be taken up to three times during any one academic year. There are three questionnaires, one for each of the three user groups: school leaders, teachers and students. Each school can set up the questions to suit its needs, choosing from optional statements and adding its own questions. Once students, teachers and school leaders have replied, the school receives a custom report with data and insights. These findings can help a school see what is working well and less well, and identify areas where action is needed (for instance whether teachers are satisfied with the training they receive; what part of the infrastructure students would want to improve; whether the school has a vision for how it wants to use technology and, if so, whether this has been communicated to staff and students). All responses to SELFIE are anonymous, and no personal data is collected. The data will not be used to rank schools or education systems. It helps teachers and students discuss how best to use new technologies in teaching and learning, and boost their digital skills. Schools can take stock of where they are at on their digital journey and set their future course. Participation should be on a voluntary basis and will be anonymous. Users do not need to login to SELFIE and do not require a username or password. The links can be copied and distributed by email or by being published, for example, on the school\u2019s shared drive. It is recommended that younger students complete the questionnaires as a whole class activity with a teacher. Once the survey has been submitted, a Get Participation Certificate link will appear. Clicking on this will open a printable certificate signed by European Commission, which the user can personalise, if he or she wishes to do so, by adding his or her name. The name entered is NOT stored as participation in SELFIE is anonymous. Please remind staff and students that certificates cannot be generated at a later date as no data on individual users is stored. Mails \u00e0 envoyer \u29eb Premier mail \u29eb Good afternoon everyone, I will invite you soon to take part in a survey which involves the whole school (primary, lower secondary, upper secondary, teachers, students, school leaders...). This survey is called SELFIE . SELFIE is the European Commission's free online tool that helps schools assess and improve the ways they use technology for teaching and learning. It stands for Self-reflection on Effective Learning by Fostering Innovation through Educational technology . SELFIE anonymously gathers the views of students, teachers and school leaders on how technology is used in their school. Almost all questions are answered on a five-point scale with 1 the lowest rating and 5 the highest. Based on this input, the tool generates a report, a snapshot (a \"SELFIE\" ) of a school\u2018s strengths and weaknesses in their use of technology. It can help a school see what is working well and less well, and identify areas where action is needed (for instance whether teachers are satisfied with the training they receive; what part of the infrastructure students would want to improve; whether the school has a vision for how it wants to use technology). I will keep you inform and will provide you with some more details as soon as possible, but I want to thank you for your participation. Deuxi\u00e8me mail \u29eb The survey is almost ready. So let me explain a little bit more about SELFIE. As you may know, SELFIE is a tool to help schools realise where they stand in their use of digital technologies. It offers a way of taking a \u201cselfie\u201d of our school by looking at different areas: school strategies, teaching, infrastructure, curriculum and experience of students. To do that, a survey must be completed. Whether you are a teacher, a student or a school leader, you are expected to answer a series of questions. While participation is on a voluntary basis and will be anonymous, you understand that the more answers we get, the more accurate the report will be. Regarding students participation, it is recommended that they complete the questionnaires as a whole class activity with a teacher. So, I would like CTL to take a little bit of time to take this survey with their students. By doing so, the teacher can explain to students what is SELFIE, why they are answering these questions and help them if necessary. It takes around 20 minutes for students and 40 for teachers and school leaders. You will have three weeks. Participants will no longer be able to answer or access the questions after the closing date. Troisi\u00e8me mail \u29eb The surveys are now ready to be filled.

Through SELFIE, we know that we can improve things like data protection, safer use of the internet, and social networks. We also need to boost the confidence of teachers with more training and support in using technology. If you would like to know how it works, please have a look at How SELFIE works . It uses questionnaires to collect the views of school leaders, teachers and students, on an anonymous and voluntary basis, and compiles the results in an interactive report that can identify strengths and weaknesses. SELFIE can be taken every year to enable a school to monitor its progress over time and can be taken up to three times during any one academic year. There are three questionnaires, one for each of the three user groups: school leaders, teachers and students. Each school can set up the questions to suit its needs, choosing from optional statements and adding its own questions. Once students, teachers and school leaders have replied, the school receives a custom report with data and insights. These findings can help a school see what is working well and less well, and identify areas where action is needed (for instance whether teachers are satisfied with the training they receive; what part of the infrastructure students would want to improve; whether the school has a vision for how it wants to use technology and, if so, whether this has been communicated to staff and students). All responses to SELFIE are anonymous, and no personal data is collected. The data will not be used to rank schools or education systems. It helps teachers and students discuss how best to use new technologies in teaching and learning, and boost their digital skills. Schools can take stock of where they are at on their digital journey and set their future course. Participation should be on a voluntary basis and will be anonymous. Users do not need to login to SELFIE and do not require a username or password. The links can be copied and distributed by email or by being published, for example, on the school\u2019s shared drive. It is recommended that younger students complete the questionnaires as a whole class activity with a teacher. Once the survey has been submitted, a Get Participation Certificate link will appear.

I would like to discuss some of the reasons why studying with the help of a teaching machine is often dramatically effective . With the machine you have just seen in use, the student sees a bit of text or other printed material in a window. This may be a sentence or two or an equation in arithmetic. Some small part is missing, and the student must supply it by writing on exposed strip of paper. His response may be the answer to a question or the solution of a problem. But generally it is simply a symbol or Word, which completes the material that you just read. As soon as the student has written his response, he operates the machine and learns immediately whether he is right or wrong. This is a great improvement over the system in which papers are corrected by a teacher where the student must wait perhaps still another day to learn whether or not what he has written is right. Such immediate knowledge has two principal effects. It aids most rapidly to the formation of correct behaviour. The student quickly learns to be right. But there is also a motivating effect. The student is free of uncertainty or anxiety about his success or failure. His work is pleasurable . He does not have to force himself to study.

One function of a teaching machine learners [??? ] to give the student a quick report and the adequacy of his response. This is important not only for efficient learning to generate a high level of interest, and enthusiasm. Another important advantage is that the student is free to move at his own pace . With techniques in which a whole class is forced to move forward together, the bright student wastes time wasting by waiting for others to catch up. And the slow student will may not be in theory or in any other respect is forced to go too fast. Not quite completing one day's assignment is even less likely to complete a second and he gets farther and farther behind and often gives up altogether unless remedial steps are taken. A student who is learning by machine moves at the rate which is most effective for him. The fast student covers a course in a short time, but the slowest student by giving more time to the subject can cover the same ground. Both learn the material thoroughly. The third feature of machine teaching is that each student follows a carefully constructed programme, leading from the initial stage where he is only unfamiliar with a subject to a final stage in which he is competent . He does this by taking a large number of very small steps arranged in a coherent order. Each step is so small that he is almost certain to take it correctly. The material is designed to give the student as much help as possible, without in any sense being tested. Instead, helpful hints suggestions and prompt maximise the chances that he will be right. The fact that each step is very small is important. Even though it may not seem like much of an accomplishment, it is always progress in the right direction. Programmes have been constructed and which without any prior study, the average student is right 95% of the time. This plays out is partly due to the fact that the student only moves on when he has completely mastered all the preceding material. If he is absent, he does not miss any work, because he takes up where he left off upon returning to the machine . A conservative estimate seems to be that with these machines, the average grade or high school students can cover about twice as much material but the same amount of time and effort as with traditional classroom techniques. There is no magic about this. A teaching machine is simply a convenient way of bringing the student into contact with a man who writes the programme.

And now, a brief definition of the web: To count as being part of the web, your app or page must: Be linkable, and Allow any client to access it. Twitter's history is instructive on this question. Once upon a time, anybody could make an app that would work directly with Twitter's raw data. It was essentially a real-time news service / social network that anybody could make a client for on any platform. That is, until Twitter capped how many users those apps could have. Twitter is part of the web, but it could have been the progenitor of another kind of non-HTML web had it not locked down its APIs. The openness of the web allowed small companies to become big ones without seeking permission from the biggest ones. Preserving the web, or more specifically the open principles behind it, means protecting one of the few paths for innovation left in the modern tech world that doesn't have a giant company acting as a gatekeeper. And there's reason not to trust those giant companies: there's much less incentive to encourage openness when you have a massive empire to defend. https://twitter.com/ballmatthew/status/1472675649265545233?s=21 https://twitter.com/valaafshar/status/1474735162567106561?s=21 The 'Dead-Internet Theory' Is Wrong but Feels True - The Atlantic First dot.com bubble https://youtu.be/vMKNUylmanQ Le Web est-il devenu trop compliqu\u00e9 ? \u2013 Framablog The American Web \u29eb The World Wide Web might have been invented in Geneva, at the CERN research laboratory in 1989, but the ways by which the Web is accessed are as American as baseball, which gives the American Intelligence Community the home field advantage.

Internet est un protocole de communication appel\u00e9 TCP/IP : TCP pour transmission control protocol, IP pour internet protocol. Ce protocole permet de mettre en communication des ordinateurs en utilisant diff\u00e9rentes infrastructures de r\u00e9seaux : le c\u00e2ble de la t\u00e9l\u00e9vision, le syst\u00e8me t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique, les satellites, etc. La gen\u00e8se de ce protocole remonte aux ann\u00e9es 1960, avant qu\u2019il ne prenne sa forme d\u00e9finitive en 1983. L\u2019ing\u00e9nieur am\u00e9ricain Vinton \u00ab Vint \u00bb Cerf est, avec un autre ing\u00e9nieur, Robert Kahn, l\u2019un de ses principaux concepteurs. Il ne faut pas confondre internet et le web, comme le rappellent avec humour Tim Berners-Lee (\u00e0 gauche) et Vint Cerf (\u00e0 droite). Le web est bien plus r\u00e9cent. Il est invent\u00e9 par l\u2019informaticien britannique Tim Berners-Lee en 1990. Berners-Lee travaille alors au CERN , Centre de recherche europ\u00e9en de recherche nucl\u00e9aire, en Suisse [...]. Le web est un protocole de communication qui permet de relier entre elles des pages, via un syst\u00e8me d\u2019adressage devenu familier : http://www. Dans le jargon des informaticiens, on dit que le web est une couche haute qui utilise une couche basse : le protocole TCP/IP d\u2019internet. Ainsi, les protocoles SMTP, FTP ou IRC \"ne fonctionnent que parce qu\u2019ils exploitent cette infrastructure-racine, TCP/IP, qui est internet.\" En 1962, Joseph Licklider est nomm\u00e9 \u00e0 la t\u00eate de l\u2019IPTO, un d\u00e9partement de l\u2019ARPA qui coordonnera et financera les travaux \u00e0 l\u2019origine d\u2019internet.

L'ARPA soutient la recherche dans des domaines tr\u00e8s divers sans poser d\u2019exigences op\u00e9rationnelles imm\u00e9diates. Licklider estime que les ordinateurs travailleront en r\u00e9seau (pas le cas \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque).

And now, a brief definition of the web: To count as being part of the web, your app or page must: Be linkable, and Allow any client to access it. Twitter's history is instructive on this question. Once upon a time, anybody could make an app that would work directly with Twitter's raw data. It was essentially a real-time news service / social network that anybody could make a client for on any platform. That is, until Twitter capped how many users those apps could have. Twitter is part of the web, but it could have been the progenitor of another kind of non-HTML web had it not locked down its APIs. The openness of the web allowed small companies to become big ones without seeking permission from the biggest ones. Preserving the web, or more specifically the open principles behind it, means protecting one of the few paths for innovation left in the modern tech world that doesn't have a giant company acting as a gatekeeper. And there's reason not to trust those giant companies: there's much less incentive to encourage openness when you have a massive empire to defend. https://twitter.com/ballmatthew/status/1472675649265545233?s=21 https://twitter.com/valaafshar/status/1474735162567106561?s=21 The 'Dead-Internet Theory' Is Wrong but Feels True - The Atlantic First dot.com bubble https://youtu.be/vMKNUylmanQ Le Web est-il devenu trop compliqu\u00e9 ? \u2013 Framablog","title":"And now, a brief definition of the web"},{"location":"Documentation/Web/#the-american-web","text":"The World Wide Web might have been invented in Geneva, at the CERN research laboratory in 1989, but the ways by which the Web is accessed are as American as baseball, which gives the American Intelligence Community the home field advantage.

Internet est un protocole de communication appel\u00e9 TCP/IP : TCP pour transmission control protocol, IP pour internet protocol. Ce protocole permet de mettre en communication des ordinateurs en utilisant diff\u00e9rentes infrastructures de r\u00e9seaux : le c\u00e2ble de la t\u00e9l\u00e9vision, le syst\u00e8me t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique, les satellites, etc. La gen\u00e8se de ce protocole remonte aux ann\u00e9es 1960, avant qu\u2019il ne prenne sa forme d\u00e9finitive en 1983. L\u2019ing\u00e9nieur am\u00e9ricain Vinton \u00ab Vint \u00bb Cerf est, avec un autre ing\u00e9nieur, Robert Kahn, l\u2019un de ses principaux concepteurs. Il ne faut pas confondre internet et le web, comme le rappellent avec humour Tim Berners-Lee (\u00e0 gauche) et Vint Cerf (\u00e0 droite). Le web est bien plus r\u00e9cent. Il est invent\u00e9 par l\u2019informaticien britannique Tim Berners-Lee en 1990. Berners-Lee travaille alors au CERN , Centre de recherche europ\u00e9en de recherche nucl\u00e9aire, en Suisse [...]. Le web est un protocole de communication qui permet de relier entre elles des pages, via un syst\u00e8me d\u2019adressage devenu familier : http://www. Dans le jargon des informaticiens, on dit que le web est une couche haute qui utilise une couche basse : le protocole TCP/IP d\u2019internet. Ainsi, les protocoles SMTP, FTP ou IRC \"ne fonctionnent que parce qu\u2019ils exploitent cette infrastructure-racine, TCP/IP, qui est internet.\" En 1962, Joseph Licklider est nomm\u00e9 \u00e0 la t\u00eate de l\u2019IPTO, un d\u00e9partement de l\u2019ARPA qui coordonnera et financera les travaux \u00e0 l\u2019origine d\u2019internet.

L'ARPA soutient la recherche dans des domaines tr\u00e8s divers sans poser d\u2019exigences op\u00e9rationnelles imm\u00e9diates. Licklider estime que les ordinateurs travailleront en r\u00e9seau (pas le cas \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque). Aid\u00e9 des informaticiens Robert Taylor et de Larry Roberts, il amorce \u00e0 l\u2019ARPA-IPTO un processus de mise en place d\u2019un r\u00e9seau de communication entre ordinateurs. Une ambition nouvelle : substituer un r\u00e9seau distribu\u00e9 \u00e0 des r\u00e9seaux centralis\u00e9s (Paul Baran). Aux deux formes oppos\u00e9es que sont le r\u00e9seau centralis\u00e9 (a) et le r\u00e9seau distribu\u00e9 (c), s\u2019ajoute une forme interm\u00e9diaire, celle d\u2019un r\u00e9seau d\u00e9centralis\u00e9 (b) dans lequel certains n\u0153uds ont une importance plus grande que les autres. Cette derni\u00e8re forme, d\u00e9centralis\u00e9e, est celle qui correspondra finalement \u00e0 la r\u00e9alit\u00e9 op\u00e9rationnelle d\u2019internet.

One of these ways has always been through URL actions. This is how opening a link in any app can automatically move you over to Safari with the corresponding webpage open, or tapping an address can take you into Maps with a pin on the specified location. Safari and Maps both have URL schemes which support this type of communication. Third-party developers have managed to take advantage of this small opening through which apps can \u201ctalk\u201d to each other to make incredible things possible by giving their apps powerful URL Schemes. [...] The x-callback-url is a specification created by Greg Pierce . Pierce, not by conincidence, is also the developer of Drafts. x-callback-url is something that developers can freely implement into the built-in URL schemes of their apps to allow them to send a \u201csuccess\u201d parameter after completing a certain action. It is very similar to an \u201cif, then\u201d statement in other programming languages. When you run an action for an app that supports x-callback-url, you can tell the app to run a second action once the first action has been completed. This is by far the most important aspect of iOS automation. Without x-callback-url, advanced iOS automation would be impossible. Going back to the Drafts URL scheme, it\u2019s very important not to forget to add \u201cx-callback-url/\u201d to the end of the top level Drafts URL. The beginning of any Drafts action you ever build should be drafts://x-callback-url/ . [...] drafts://x-callback-url/create?text=Hello%20World&action=Tweet%3A%20the_axx&x-success= . Our action is now doing six tasks: drafts:// tells iOS to open Drafts. x-callback-url/ tells Drafts to enable its built in x-callback parameters. (We\u2019ll get to those later.) create? Tells Drafts to create a new draft. text=Hello%20World tells Drafts to populate that new draft with the words \u201cHello World\u201d. &action=\"Tweet%3A%20the_axx runs the built-in \u201cTweet: the_axx\u201d action and posts \u201cHello World\u201d to my Twitter account. &x-success= tells Drafts that once it successfully tweets \u201cHello World\u201d, it will then perform another action.

Each and every iOS app lives in its own \u201csandboxed\u201d environment. Apps cannot reach outside of their sandboxes and into others to send or receive information from one another. [...] There are two official ways for iOS apps to communicate with each other: the \u201cOpen In\u201d menu, and URL schemes. [...] URL schemes are foundations that can be built into apps which allow the app to be launched, and often various functions within it to be triggered, automatically via URLs. These URLs look very similar to the standard URLs which everyone who has used a web browser understands, except they start with an app name instead of \u201chttp\u201d. So instead of launching a website by typing \u201chttp://\u201d into your browser, you could launch, say, Drafts by typing \u201cdrafts://\u201d into the browser. [...] For the actions x-callback-url is supported in, simply add x-callback-url/ between launch:// and the chosen path. So if you were going to use x-callback-url to chain a second action to an in-app messaging action, your URL would start like this: launch://x-callback-url/messaging launch://messaging?to=555-555-5555&body={{This is a sample action.}} launch://email?to={{sample@contrast.co}}&subject=Sample&body={{This is just a sample.

One of these ways has always been through URL actions. This is how opening a link in any app can automatically move you over to Safari with the corresponding webpage open, or tapping an address can take you into Maps with a pin on the specified location. Safari and Maps both have URL schemes which support this type of communication. Third-party developers have managed to take advantage of this small opening through which apps can \u201ctalk\u201d to each other to make incredible things possible by giving their apps powerful URL Schemes. [...] The x-callback-url is a specification created by Greg Pierce . Pierce, not by conincidence, is also the developer of Drafts. x-callback-url is something that developers can freely implement into the built-in URL schemes of their apps to allow them to send a \u201csuccess\u201d parameter after completing a certain action. It is very similar to an \u201cif, then\u201d statement in other programming languages. When you run an action for an app that supports x-callback-url, you can tell the app to run a second action once the first action has been completed. This is by far the most important aspect of iOS automation. Without x-callback-url, advanced iOS automation would be impossible. Going back to the Drafts URL scheme, it\u2019s very important not to forget to add \u201cx-callback-url/\u201d to the end of the top level Drafts URL. The beginning of any Drafts action you ever build should be drafts://x-callback-url/ . [...] drafts://x-callback-url/create?text=Hello%20World&action=Tweet%3A%20the_axx&x-success= . Our action is now doing six tasks: drafts:// tells iOS to open Drafts. x-callback-url/ tells Drafts to enable its built in x-callback parameters. (We\u2019ll get to those later.) create? Tells Drafts to create a new draft. text=Hello%20World tells Drafts to populate that new draft with the words \u201cHello World\u201d. &action=\"Tweet%3A%20the_axx runs the built-in \u201cTweet: the_axx\u201d action and posts \u201cHello World\u201d to my Twitter account. &x-success= tells Drafts that once it successfully tweets \u201cHello World\u201d, it will then perform another action.

Each and every iOS app lives in its own \u201csandboxed\u201d environment. Apps cannot reach outside of their sandboxes and into others to send or receive information from one another. [...] There are two official ways for iOS apps to communicate with each other: the \u201cOpen In\u201d menu, and URL schemes. [...] URL schemes are foundations that can be built into apps which allow the app to be launched, and often various functions within it to be triggered, automatically via URLs. These URLs look very similar to the standard URLs which everyone who has used a web browser understands, except they start with an app name instead of \u201chttp\u201d. So instead of launching a website by typing \u201chttp://\u201d into your browser, you could launch, say, Drafts by typing \u201cdrafts://\u201d into the browser. [...] For the actions x-callback-url is supported in, simply add x-callback-url/ between launch:// and the chosen path. So if you were going to use x-callback-url to chain a second action to an in-app messaging action, your URL would start like this: launch://x-callback-url/messaging launch://messaging?to=555-555-5555&body={{This is a sample action.}} launch://email?to={{sample@contrast.co}}&subject=Sample&body={{This is just a sample.

Otter As as student, the iPad can help you overcome many difficulties and offers you many solutions to help you with your writing or improve your ability to read. These solutions are classified into three parts: Read , Write & Understand . Here they are. And they are all free! Read \u29eb 1. Use Speak selection \u29eb Go to Settings > General > Accessibility > Speech > Speak selection to activate Speak selection. You can then read any piece of text on the iPad. Handy when you can't pronounce or recognize a word. 2. Use Shortcuts \u29eb Use this shortcut to display a web page with the Open Dyslexic font. Useful if you are dyslexic and you have a problem reading online. 3. OpenDyslexic font \u29eb Download the OpenDyslexic font to display all your documents with this font specially designed for dyslexic students. If you don\u2019t know how to install a font, visit this page: How to use custom fonts on iPhone and iPad . 4. Reader mode \u29eb Read comfortably using Reader mode. To do this, tap the four small lines in the address bar in Safari. You will thus avoid any unnecessary distraction (advertisements, navigation menus, etc.). 5. Convert a web page into a PDF \u29eb By doing this, you will be able to export the page, read it in offline mode and even annotate or highlight passages you want to remember. To do this, since iOS 13, take a screenshot and choose Full page then save your PDF with the app of your choice. 6. Office Lens \u29eb With Office Lens from Microsoft, you can take a picture of a document (a book for instance) or a whiteboard and scan it. From now on, you can share this picture to the built-in Immersive Reader and change the font (the Comic Sans is great for dyslexic students), change the size, detach syllabes, display nouns in purple, verbs in red and much more. You can use Picture Dictionary, translate, read out loud the text as well. Write \u29eb 7. Use the Speak recognition fonction \u29eb It may happen that you cannot write a word and you cannot find its spelling in your dictionary. In this case, record your voice. The iPad will recognize the word for you and at the same time give you its spelling. To do this, press the small microphone at the bottom of the keyboard next to the space bar. 8. Create shortcuts \u29eb If you have trouble typing quickly, create shortcuts. For instance, to write your email address quickly, create a shortcut like \"yh\" and by writing this you will get \"yhoury@lyceeinternational.london\". To do this, go to Settings > General > Keyboard > Text replacement . 9. Turn your handwriting into block letters \u29eb Hand write with Notability and turn your handwriting into block letters. Write by hand, select your text using the \u2704 icon, press the selection and in the menu that appears, choose Convert To Text . 10. Fluently \u29eb As one can read on the website : Fluently is an online text editor with a multilingual translator, dictionary, and thesaurus built-in. So if you need to write (and not only to translate like you would using Google Translate) and format a document, your are at the right place. 11. Google Docs \u29eb Everyone knows Google Docs but it\u2019s worth remember it: you are not alone. If you get through the blank page anguish, remember that you can share your document with a friend who can help you. Also remember your teacher can read what you are writing and provide you feedback and advice. So think of it! 12. MindNode \u29eb Traditional note-taking may be difficult for youngest students. With MindNode , which is a mind mapping app, you can jot down your thoughts, create some kind of picture of your ideas and export them as rich text. Understand \u29eb 13. Check your spelling \u29eb Check your spelling, if you are a French speaker, with le bon patron . Of course, you can find many spell checkers (such as Grammarly or Language Tool ). But the reason why I\u2019m suggesting my students to use Le bon patron is that they can get explanations both in French or in English so when they are more confident with one or other language, this is helpful. The English version of Le bon patron is SpellCheckPlus . 14. Use a dictionary \u29eb For French speakers, go to Larousse and search for the word you want to know the spelling. Also think to check conjugation as well with the Bescherelle . To avoid typing \u201cLarousse\u201d ou \u201cBescherelle\u201d every time you need to visit these pages, create a favorite . To do that, press the rectangle icon located in the upper-right corner of your screen (the one with a little arrow pointing to the top) and choose Add to favorite . 15. Phonetic search \u29eb For French speakers only. Do a phonetic search by using the Acad\u00e9mie fran\u00e7aise dictionary. Type the word you are looking for spelling and choose Mots proches . The dictionary will find the right spelling for you! 16. Built-in dictionary \u29eb Use the built-in dictionary (to add a dictionary, go to Settings > General > Dictionary ). To use it, press a word to make it appeared and choose Look up . 17. Create your own dictionary \u29eb Create your own dictionary and memorise the vocabulary you\u2019ve learn while working or reading. In Notes , create a folder labelled Dictionary and create as many notes as there are letters in the alphabet. To sort these notes in an alphabetic order, go to Settings > Notes > Sort notes by . 18. Google Translate \u29eb Translate words you don\u2019t understand. Use Google translate or Word reference to find the meaning of a word. Don\u2019t try to figure out the meaning of a complete text. Instead, try to understand a word, a group of words or even a sentence. You can even translate a paper document with the augmented reality feature of the app. 19. Google translate in a spreadsheet \u29eb By using the formula Google Translate in Google sheets, you will be able to get a translation of the words you don\u2019t know. Depending on which language you want, the function should look like that: =GOOGLETRANSLATE($A1,\"fr\",\"en\") . You can even create some kind of automatic research of the translated word by using this function: =HYPERLINK(\"https://www.larousse.fr/dictionnaires/francais/\"&A1, \"Fran\u00e7ais\") . By doing this, you create swiftly and automatically a dictionary without having to write a lot of things! 20. Otter \u29eb Having a Zoom videoconference with your students? Consider using Otter which provide a real-time transcript so students don\u2019t have to take notes and can keep focused on what you say. Transcribing your Zoom meeting can also help those that are deaf or hard of hearing. Moreover you can listen to your transcript of course but you can also highlight text or comments it. Very convenient! Only for English teachers (Otter only supports English) using their computer. title: Voir aussi collapse: open - [\u00c9crire](./\u00c9crire.md) - [Otter](../Otter.md)","title":"20 tips to learn how to better read and write with the iPad"},{"location":"Documentation/Apple/20%20tips%20to%20learn%20how%20to%20better%20read%20and%20write%20with%20the%20iPad/#table-of-content","text":"Read 1.

Transcribing your Zoom meeting can also help those that are deaf or hard of hearing. Moreover you can listen to your transcript of course but you can also highlight text or comments it.

The former is an app that helps you manage student devices; the latter is an LMS (that is to say a Learning Management System ). If you are not familiar with Google Classroom, I suggest you read the introduction guides. To give you an example, with Google Classroom, you are going to assign an activity or send a document to your students. While this is possible with Apple Classroom, you\u2019ll want to use it to monitor a student\u2019s iPad: is the student working? Is he or she playing a game or doing something else? Let\u2019s get started \u29eb You don\u2019t need to create a class. The IT department already did it. So all you have to do is to select your class. You\u2019ll find all your students. \u26a0\ufe0f In order to work properly, it is required that Bluetooth\u2019s is on. While we are at it, I always ask my students that their iPad is on silent mode , that Do not disturb is on and of course that the Bluetooth is on. Thanks to Shortcuts all of this can be automated. More on that later. So you have your classes. Select one of them and you\u2019ll see that you have seven options. Open Navigate Hide Lock Mute Screens Group 1. Open \u29eb When selected, you can open an app (say Books ) on all the iPads of your class at the same time. You have one option: Lock in app after opening , which means students can\u2019t do anything else. This aims to help them keep focused. \u26a0\ufe0f Be careful! Students know a way around this restriction. All they have to do is to restart their iPad. So go check once in a while. 2. Navigate \u29eb You can launch a specific webpage. So there is no need to share a URL or display a QR Code. However, to do that, you need to bookmark the page on your own browser. As above, you can Lock in app after opening . 3. Hide \u29eb The Hide button simply does what it says. It hides the app or the website you launched. 4. Lock \u29eb If you see that a student is not paying attention or is doing something else, you can lock the student\u2019s iPad. Don\u2019t forget to select the locked student iPad and to unlock it when needed. Anyway, the student will remind you or will restart the device. \ud83d\udca1 When you want students to listen, ask them to put their iPad upside down. 5. Mute \u29eb You can mute an iPad. Of course, this is not necessary because the student would already have done it. \ud83d\ude03 6. Screens \u29eb This is probably my favourite feature of Apple Classroom. It feels a bit like being CCTV but it\u2019s very convenient. In every class, you know that there are always students who need extra help to keep focused on what we are doing. \u26a0\ufe0f As you watch, the status bar on the student's iPad will turn blue so he or she knows you're watching. 7. Group \u29eb Classroom lets you create custom groups within your class. It\u2019s pretty handy if you want to differentiate and give a specific task to a specific group of students. Just tap the Group button, select a group of students, then name the group. There\u2019s more \u29eb Even if you don\u2019t see it when you open up Apple Classroom, you still have some interesting features. Be notified if students exchange docs \u29eb The first I\u2019d like to mention is that when a student send something to another student using AirDrop, you are notified and you can see which document has been unduly sent. I can assure you that it may be funny. Share document \u29eb This is not a hidden feature properly speaking. It\u2019s rather an invisible one because it relies on drag & drop. So here\u2019s the thing: you can share files with your students (spreadsheets, presentations, videos, anything you want). Swipe up from the bottom of your screen to bring up the dock. Touch and hold the Files app to see recent documents. Then drag one of them to one or several students. Or, if you prefer, use split view and then drag and drop your doc from one app to another. Tell your students to accept the document you are sharing. Using the Dock \u29eb Using Split View \u29eb Share student work \u29eb Thanks to a projector and an Apple TV, it can be very useful to display a student\u2019s screen. Select your student. Select AirPlay to project a student\u2019s screen. Select the appropriate Apple TV from the list. Summary \u29eb The last feature is the report you end up with when the class is over.

You can listen some of the books we've recorded during the past few years. They've been uploaded to SoundCloud . But, of course, you will be able to share your recordings wherever you want. It can be on Google Drive or iCloud Drive for instance. To get started, all you need, is basically your iPad and GarageBand. For better results, I also suggest to use an external mic. I've bought the R\u00d8DE NT-USB for myself but, regarding your students, they may use any headphones with a built-in mic. It will be more than enough. So let's get started and we will open up GarageBand very soon but first let's prepare everything we need. Our goal \u29eb We want students to record an audiobook. Why that? First, they will have to read a bunch of stories (let's say fairy tales for our youngest students) They'll have to pick one. A story not too long, not too hard, which they love and with enough characters so everyone can read. Students will need to collaborate (who reads what and how, etc.). They'll have to select music and sound (footsteps, thunder, bell, applause... all kind of tones). Then, they'll have to record themselves. Presumably in a quiet environment (this can be done as homework). Finally, they'll meet again and will do the editing, which is not the easiest task but we'll come to that later. The above screenshots show you the work of a group of students using both papers and their iPads or phones. Whit that, we're good to go. Open up GarageBand \u29eb So as you can expect, tap on the GarageBand icon and tap on the + button on the upper-right corner. Select the Audio recorder to record your voice in the so-called (if I'm not mistaken) Sound browser . You're going to be able to record your voice very soon but first there's a bunch of things we need to take care of. First, you have to make sure the metronome is off and that you tapped the little + button located on the top right corner. This is Song Sections and you need to set it to Automatic . Also, make sure Count-in is deactivated . Record your voice \u29eb Now you can record your voice by tapping the round red button . \ud83d\udca1 Good to know \u29eb The Audio Recorder has two sets of controls you can use to change the sound. Fun view lets you quickly change the sound of your recording, while Studio view gives you more options to enhance your recording. (\ud83d\udd17 link ) While you record, the In level slider on the left shows the input level from the microphone. If the level turns red, drag the slider down (or record the part again more softly) to prevent distortion. (\ud83d\udd17 link ) As you record, a red strip will appear. As soon as you are finished, press the stop button (the square one next to the red one). \ud83d\udca1 Good to know \u29eb You can use a noise gate to reduce low-level input noise when you record. A noise gate cuts off the sound when it falls below a certain minimum level. (\ud83d\udd17 link ) Apply effects \u29eb Do you want to play a little bit and add some effects to your recording, watch this amazing work done by \u2014ehughes\u2014 . Edit your recording \u29eb You can edit your recording. You can trim it, move it, copy, delete or split it. Among other things. First, select the so-called region ( strange name , isn't it?). Trim a region \u29eb Now that your region is selected, drag the left or right edge of the frame. Move a region \u29eb That is pretty self-explanatory. Just drag and drop your region wherever you want it to be (it makes more sense when you have different regions and you need to reorder them). Copy your region and more \u29eb Just tap and hold your region. You will be able to different things: cut, copy, delete, rename, etc. Also very interesting, you'll be able to split your recording. Meaning that if you want to remove something in the middle of your recording or insert something, that is completely feasible. Split your region \u29eb To do that, you need to tap the region. A menu appears. Select Split. Then, a scissors icon shows up. Place it where you want to split the region. Drag the split marker (the scissors) down and that's it! To learn everything you can do, read Edit regions in GarageBand for iPad . Of course, you can add as many track you want. Just press the big + button on the left hand side. \ud83d\udca1 Good to know \u29eb If you don't know where to look in GarageBand, presse the question mark on the upper-right corner. Now, we are going to learn one last thing and we'll move on to the next part of this tutorial . Automation \u29eb Indeed, in the next session of this tutorial, we are going to see how we can add or create music and sounds to make our audiobooks standout. But first, we need to keep something in mind. We are going to have a complicated file to edit. After a while, you'll end up with a document with lots of tracks including voice recordings, sounds and music and sometimes all of these can overlaps. For instance, you may want a little background, a faint music while the narrator is speaking or you want to insert a sound (a dog barking, the noise of a closing door... anything). So you may want to create volume changes. That's when you want to use Automation . In the above example, volume is going up progressively. Doing that is very easy in GarageBand. First tap a track header (on the left right hand side. On the big mic icon). In the menu, tap Automation . Toggle on the Edit Automation button (the red one with a pen) on the left side of the control bar. Insert an automation point and another one (as many as you need). Adjust the sound volume. Close the automation editor by tapping Done in the upper-right corner of the control bar. Now, we are going to learn how to add sounds and music. .","title":"Create an Audiobook With GarageBand 1"},{"location":"Documentation/Apple/Create%20an%20Audiobook%20With%20GarageBand%201/#part-1","text":"In this tutorial, we'll learn how to create an audiobook using GarageBand .

Fingers \u29eb Well, this is pretty self-explanatory! iPads can be used with fingers! But this is far more complicated than it seems.

As I write a lot of text, I definitely need a real keyboard. Moreover, when using a physical keyboard, you get rid of the virtual one which occupies half of the screen. By the way, are you a keyboard heavy-user? Then you must be aware that by pressing certain key combinations , you can do things that normally require a mouse, a trackpad or any extra gesture. By using keyboard shortcuts, not only will you work faster, you will work smarter and better. As a matter of fact, it is sometimes a waste of time and it can be boring to select the text, raise your hand, find the right menu, press whatever you need, return to your keyboard and so on. What if you could keep both hands on your keyboard and start doing actions without having to lift your aching arm and fingers? You may know some of these very famous combinations: Copy : \u2318 + C Paste : \u2318 + V Undo : \u2318 + Z Select all : \u2318 + A But there\u2019s more.

Indeed, you can control your iPad with the keyboard without having to lift a single finger. Say for instance you are using an app and you want to go to your home screen: press \u2318 + H . Say you want to summon Control centre, then press \u21e5 + C . Anyway, you can buy convenient and not too many expensive keyboards like this one for instance. It\u2019s a Bluetooth keyboard from Logitech . It cost \u00a351.99. It\u2019s light and handy. Or you can buy a true Keyboard like this one . It\u2019s bigger so less transportable but you will have all the function keys. But you may want to buy a keyboard which has also a case to protect your iPad. However, first, you have to be sure which model of iPad you have. To do that, go to Settings > General > About . You will find the Model Name. The fifth and sixth-generation iPads are 9.7-inch tablets. But seventh and eight are 10.2 inches. If you plan to buy a separate keyboard, it doesn\u2019t matter but if you want one with a cover, you have to be careful before buying one. So if you have a 10.2 inches iPad, this one is great and cost \u00a377.49. For the fifth and sixth-gen, this is the one . Surprisingly, it is a little bit more expensive. The new Zagg Pro keyboard seems to be a very nice one. It works with the 7th and 8th generation iPad (the one with a 10.2 inches size). It has a case that magnetically attaches to the keyboard and a backlit keyboard. Read this to learn more about it . But I strongly recommend a keyboard with a trackpad. Since iPad OS 13.2, you can use either a mouse or trackpad, which is very convenient when crunching data in a spreadsheet. This model is expensive but for that price you will get a cover, a keyboard and a trackpad. If you want to learn more about trackpad gestures for iPad, please read this guide . Stylus \u29eb As a teacher, the stylus became very important specifically when it comes to grading the work of a student. In Google Classroom, any document (even a Google Docs) can be annotated as if it was a PDF. Nothing closer to the paper. The 6th iPad generation is compatible with the first Apple Pencil generation. This is a pretty expensive model you can buy for \u00a386.52 on Amazon. Be aware that the iPad you have been provided with is not compatible with the second generation of the Apple Pencil . Hopefully, you can buy much cheaper pencils. This one, for instance, is good: MPIO Stylus Pen with Palm Rejection . If you want to, you can search on Amazon for the perfect pencil without spending too much money. I hadn\u2019t had the chance to try this one but the Adonit Note Plus seems great. It has all the features you may want: Palm Rejection, Pressure Sensitivity & Shortcut Buttons. The Logitech model seems great as well. It costs \u00a359.95. It shares a lot of features with its counterpart from Apple (since it uses Apple Pencil technology . But, again, I didn\u2019t try these stylus. Conclusion \u29eb The iPad is a powerful device provided you are using different accessories like a finger (already have one), a stylus or a keyboard (you got to buy them). If you find a stylus or a keyboard not too expensive and which serves you well, please let me know. By the way, be aware that you can also write by using your voice. When filling your report cards, it can save a lot of time. Just press the mic and the recording will automatically be converted into text.

However, first, you have to be sure which model of iPad you have. To do that, go to Settings > General > About . You will find the Model Name. The fifth and sixth-generation iPads are 9.7-inch tablets. But seventh and eight are 10.2 inches. If you plan to buy a separate keyboard, it doesn\u2019t matter but if you want one with a cover, you have to be careful before buying one. So if you have a 10.2 inches iPad, this one is great and cost \u00a377.49. For the fifth and sixth-gen, this is the one . Surprisingly, it is a little bit more expensive. The new Zagg Pro keyboard seems to be a very nice one. It works with the 7th and 8th generation iPad (the one with a 10.2 inches size). It has a case that magnetically attaches to the keyboard and a backlit keyboard. Read this to learn more about it . But I strongly recommend a keyboard with a trackpad. Since iPad OS 13.2, you can use either a mouse or trackpad, which is very convenient when crunching data in a spreadsheet. This model is expensive but for that price you will get a cover, a keyboard and a trackpad. If you want to learn more about trackpad gestures for iPad, please read this guide .","title":"Keyboard"},{"location":"Documentation/Apple/Fingers%2C%20keyboard%20and%20stylus/#stylus","text":"As a teacher, the stylus became very important specifically when it comes to grading the work of a student. In Google Classroom, any document (even a Google Docs) can be annotated as if it was a PDF. Nothing closer to the paper. The 6th iPad generation is compatible with the first Apple Pencil generation. This is a pretty expensive model you can buy for \u00a386.52 on Amazon. Be aware that the iPad you have been provided with is not compatible with the second generation of the Apple Pencil . Hopefully, you can buy much cheaper pencils. This one, for instance, is good: MPIO Stylus Pen with Palm Rejection . If you want to, you can search on Amazon for the perfect pencil without spending too much money. I hadn\u2019t had the chance to try this one but the Adonit Note Plus seems great. It has all the features you may want: Palm Rejection, Pressure Sensitivity & Shortcut Buttons. The Logitech model seems great as well. It costs \u00a359.95.

But make sure your students, if they want to write by hand and then send you their work by mail or via Classroom, take properly the photo they intend you to assess. As a matter of fact, to do that, you can download really great apps on the App Store (like Scanner Pro ), but unfortunately they are not free. Even Scanner mini is not worth it. Without paying an in-app purchase, the app is almost useless. So here are my solution and here are some of the recommandations I make. Remind your students to take a picture (in a well-lit room). Tell them to try the very simple built-in iOS scanner to use. Or use Shortcut. Well, for the first part. The advice is quite obvious but a lot of students tend to forget it. You need light to take a good picture. As you will soon see, needless to ask them to crop the photo. And speaking of the camera, don\u2019t fire it! Instead, use the built-in OS scanner. Scan documents using the Files app \u29eb It\u2019s not an easy one to spot but you can find it in the Files app. Open it. Just press anywhere (preferably in an empty space). A menu appears. Select \u201cScan Documents\u201d. Alternatively, you can tap on the three dots on the top left-hand side. Then place your document in view of the camera. It automatically locates the edges. You can scan multiple pages at one time (press Keep Scan on the bottom right-hand side). When you save your photos, you are able to store them in a unique file (this is huge!!!). And, of course, don\u2019t forget to change the title (the auto title is \u201cscanned document\u201d). The problem is: you are going to get a big file. The quality of the photos are great but the file, consequently, is too heavy. I love PDF may be the solution. Choose Compress PDF . Select the PDF you want to shrink and follow the steps. Every time, you end up with a file 90% smaller! Shortcuts \u29eb I love Shortcuts . With this app, you can automate things. Apple defines it like this: A shortcut is a quick way to get one or more tasks done with your apps. The Shortcuts app lets you create your own shortcuts with multiple steps. For example, build a \u201cSurf Time\u201d shortcut that grabs the surf report, gives an ETA to the beach and launches your surf music playlist. We are going to create a shortcut with very few steps. If you don\u2019t want to build it but only use it, you can download this one . The purpose of our shortcuts it to Launch the camera and take photos Make a PDF of these photos Set a name Save the PDF First, press the + button to create a new shortcut. On the left column, type \u201cTake photo\u201d and drag and drop the action (have a look on the next screenshot). If you have two photos, pick the appropriate number. Choose Make PDF . Set name and don\u2019t forget to add Ask Each Time . Choose Save . Students will be able to save their documents wherever they want. Even if the shortcut displays iCloud Drive, it will open up Files and one can choose whatever service we want: iCloud, Google Drive, Dropbox and so forth. You can rename your brand new shortcut. You can change the glyph as well. If you want to use it, just press Play. Or press the shortcut. By doing this way, you shouldn\u2019t have any more dark photos which would need to be cropped. You won\u2019t have two or three photos but a single file with a proper name. All you have to do is put a grade on it! \ud83d\ude03","title":"How to easily scan a paperwork"},{"location":"Documentation/Apple/How%20to%20easily%20scan%20a%20paperwork/#scan-documents-using-the-files-app","text":"It\u2019s not an easy one to spot but you can find it in the Files app. Open it.

Get rid of the text or delete the slide and create an empty one. Create your planet \u29eb On the little brush on the top right corner, select Background and change it to blue. Tap on the + button, add a shape ( Basic ). Pick a square. Make it black. Fill the slide with this square so it covers the entire blue slide. Center it. Add a new shape but a circle this time. Make it white so you can see it (tap on the brush and change the colour). Set the size (around 400 to 500pt) and center it. Now select both the black square and the white circle (first select the circle, without removing your finger, keep holding, select the black square). Go to Arrange and combine the two shapes by selecting the last icon (or the one before for that matter). Now decrease the size of your slide and get rid of the formatting option Move your square which now has a hole. Add a map \u29eb Create the map using Shapes (tap the + button) and choose Places .

A menu appears. Tap Transition . Add a transition. Pick Magic Move . Wait a little bit. Tap Done and duplicate the slide. On the second slide, move your map to the right. Go back to the first slide, make the menu appears by tapping it. Tap on Magic Move and set the duration to 10/15s approximatively. Now, when the animation is played, you will have the illusion that the hearth is spinning (but in fact, it's just Magic Move! The maps just move from the left to the right behind the black shape with the hole). Nice, isn't it? Title & Menu \u29eb Insert a title by tapping the + button. Go to Shapes > Basic > Text . Style the text. Make it fit on one line. Create a green rectangle. Insert text, style it (bold, 43 pt). Group the rectangle and the text (remember how to do that?). Duplicate five time on one side, five time on the other. Use the yellow lines to adjust the position. Change the names. Select all the names and green rectangles at once and copy and paste them in the second slide. Copy the title too. Slides & Towers \u29eb Now duplicate the first slide (it becomes the third slide). Delete the transition (just tap the slide, select Transition and delete it). Place the map where you want your first tower to appear (let's say United States for the Empire State Building). Place the tower. Insert a text box for location, height and opening. Animate your objects \u29eb Now we are going to animate our tower, our text, the map and even our button. First, animate the map. Select it. In the menu, choose Animate and pick Move In . Close the menu. Tap on the name of the animation, remove the effect Bounce on , set the duration to 5s. Animate the tower (select it and chose Pop ). Do the same with the text down below. Now, let's take care of our buttons. To indicate the state of a button, change the colour to red.

Set it to After Build 1 . Do the same for the location, height, etc. Tap Done. By the way, let's animate the title on the first slide ( Pop ) and make it play automatically.

Links \u29eb To make it a little bit more interactive, we are going make our buttons clickable. So when you click on Empire State Building, for instance, it leads us to the slide with this tower (ie the third slide). Simply tap on the green rectangle. In the menu, pick Link and link the rectangle to the third slide. The last slide \u29eb To finish, just create a slide and insert a table so everyone can find where you downloaded the images and found the information about the towers.

One way to do this is with the App Library. With an app already placed on your home screens, go to the App Library, locate the same application and long-press to drag it. You can then place it onto a home screen and your existing icon will not be removed. iOS 15 also enables drag-and-drop for apps in Spotlight search. So you can skip the App Library and directly search for your app, then drag it out of Spotlight and place it where you want it.

At a high level, the core idea behind Focus is the same as Do Not Disturb, but more fleshed out: when you want to, well, focus on particular aspects of your work or personal life, you can enable a Focus to silence notifications from specific apps or people, trigger automations in Shortcuts, and even rearrange your Home Screens. Focus is Do Not Disturb on steroids, and I believe its flexibility and customizable design will appeal to all kinds of users later this year.

Cette possibilit\u00e9 est d\u00e9sormais dans l'app Notes (iPad OS 15). Exemple : taguer les cours : #le\u00e7on, #dissertation, #exercices... Passer du papier au num\u00e9rique \u29eb Transformer un support papier en son \u00e9quivalent num\u00e9rique peut \u00eatre un gain de temps. Par exemple, transformer un questionnaire en un Google form peut permettre la correction automatique. Toutefois, la limite est celle du quiz. Toute question appellant une r\u00e9ponse d\u00e9velopp\u00e9e ne pourra \u00eatre automatiquement corrig\u00e9e. En ce sens, les exerciseurs n'ont pas fait beaucoup de progr\u00e8s depuis 20 ans. Le passage du papier au num\u00e9rique n'est pas un objectif en soi. Voir billet de blog d'Alice Keeler : Just having students fill out the same old work digitally is not preparing them for the future. It\u2019s just a paperless version of the past. Si l'on passe du papier au num\u00e9rique, cela doit s'accompagner d'une r\u00e9flexion sur l'adoption de la technologie sinon on court le risque de l'\u00e9cueil que Justin Reich appelle \"the curse of the familiar\" : Even when teachers have adequate support for technology integration, research has shown that adoption of new technologies is a process that usually begins with using new technologies in old ways . [...] She found that teachers needed to proceed through a developmental trajectory of stages: entry, adoption, adaptation, appropriation, and invention. At early stages, teachers replicated existing practices with technology, and over time, teachers developed approaches to teaching and learning that would be impossible without the new technologies . Failure to disrupt T\u00e9moignages \u29eb Conclusion \u29eb Compl\u00e9mentarit\u00e9 des pratiques, mais souplesse du num\u00e9rique et multitude de possibilit\u00e9s dont est priv\u00e9 le papier.

Chez les Grecs, l\u2019ar\u00e9t\u00e9 correspondait \u00e0 la capacit\u00e9 d\u2019un individu \u00e0 accomplir une mission, \u00e0 atteindre un but, \u00e0 r\u00e9aliser une t\u00e2che avec succ\u00e8s, en faisant usage de toutes ses qualit\u00e9s personnelles, de ses connaissances. L\u2019ar\u00e9t\u00e9 pouvait s\u2019observer dans des domaines extr\u00eamement divers, chez les humains ou les animaux. Elle \u00e9tait selon Aristote \u00ab une disposition acquise volontaire \u00bb. Pour ces raisons, j\u2019ai traduit ar\u00e9t\u00e9 par comp\u00e9tence dans la citation du M\u00e9non au d\u00e9but du chapitre 1, quand Platon demande \u00e0 Socrate si l\u2019ar\u00e9t\u00e9 s\u2019acquiert par l\u2019enseignement, par la pratique, si elle est inn\u00e9e ou si elle a une autre origine encore. Origine \u29eb L\u2019approche par comp\u00e9tences vient du monde du travail : au d\u00e9but des ann\u00e9es 1970, on a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 se demander comment on pouvait reconnaitre, voire r\u00e9mun\u00e9rer le fait qu\u2019un salari\u00e9 soit capable de bien faire ce qu\u2019il est cens\u00e9 faire, alors qu\u2019auparavant on reconnaissait et on r\u00e9mun\u00e9rait plut\u00f4t le dipl\u00f4me ou le poste. D\u00e9finition \u29eb [...] on a d\u00e9fini la comp\u00e9tence comme la capacit\u00e9 des individus \u00e0 r\u00e9aliser telle t\u00e2che en sp\u00e9cifiant les savoir-faire, les connaissances notionnelles et les \u00ab savoir-\u00eatre \u00bb impliqu\u00e9s dans cette r\u00e9alisation, voire n\u00e9cessaires \u00e0 cette r\u00e9alisation.

Dans l'approche par comp\u00e9tences, les connaissances n\u00e9cessaires (voir ci-dessus) seront employ\u00e9es \u00e0 la r\u00e9alisation d'une t\u00e2che (r\u00e9daction d'articles). Competences are the sum of knowledge, skills and characteristics that allow a person to perform actions. (Cadre europ\u00e9en commun de r\u00e9f\u00e9rence pour les langues) Conclusion du passage : [...] d\u00e8s qu\u2019on enseigne, on enseigne des comp\u00e9tences et des connaissances ; les deux sont strictement d\u00e9pendants l\u2019un de l\u2019autre. Sans t\u00e2che \u00e0 mettre en \u0153uvre, les connaissances ne sont rien ; sans connaissances, les t\u00e2ches ne peuvent pas \u00eatre mises en \u0153uvre. Trois raisons pour lesquelles l'approche par comp\u00e9tences est int\u00e9ressante selon Tricot \u29eb Premi\u00e8re raison \u29eb elle constitue une incitation syst\u00e9matique \u00e0 sp\u00e9cifier la ou les t\u00e2ches qui sont vis\u00e9es par l\u2019apprentissage et qui vont \u00eatre utilis\u00e9es au cours de l\u2019apprentissage. Deuxi\u00e8me raison \u29eb en nous obligeant \u00e0 sp\u00e9cifier les t\u00e2ches, elle nous d\u00e9barrasse de concepts bien vagues, comme \u00ab intelligence \u00bb, \u00ab capacit\u00e9 d\u2019abstraction \u00bb et autres \u00ab bonne m\u00e9moire \u00bb. Troisi\u00e8me raison \u29eb la connaissance est insuffisante pour pr\u00e9dire la r\u00e9alisation de la t\u00e2che. Pour pr\u00e9dire la \u00ab capacit\u00e9 d\u2019un individu \u00e0 r\u00e9aliser une t\u00e2che \u00bb, nous avons donc bien besoin du couple {T\u00e2che ; Connaissance}. Un couple connaissance/t\u00e2che difficile \u29eb Probl\u00e8me expos\u00e9 et dans L'innovation p\u00e9dagogique et dans Pr\u00e9cis d'ing\u00e9nierie p\u00e9dagogique . [...] alors qu\u2019un individu maitrise la connaissance n\u00e9cessaire et suffisante \u00e0 la r\u00e9alisation d\u2019une certaine t\u00e2che, il est fr\u00e9quent d\u2019observer que cet individu ne parvient pas \u00e0 mobiliser cette connaissance pour cette t\u00e2che. L'innovation p\u00e9dagogique Par exemple, essayez de r\u00e9soudre le probl\u00e8me suivant : \u00ab J\u2019ai achet\u00e9 une boule de p\u00e9tanque et un cochonnet. J\u2019ai pay\u00e9 le tout 1,10 \u20ac. La boule co\u00fbte 1 \u20ac de plus que le cochonnet. Combien coute le cochonnet ? \u00bb La majorit\u00e9 des adultes (g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement, des \u00e9tudiants) r\u00e9pond \u00ab 10 centimes \u00bb. Pourtant, la r\u00e9ponse correcte est \u00ab 5 centimes \u00bb. Peut-on en conclure que la majorit\u00e9 des adultes cultiv\u00e9s ne sait pas faire une addition ou une soustraction ? La difficult\u00e9 de ce probl\u00e8me r\u00e9side dans le fait que \u00ab 10 centimes \u00bb nous saute aux yeux : le tout = 1,10 \u20ac ; la boule coute 1 \u20ac et le cochonnet 10 centimes. Or, il est \u00e9crit : \u00ab La boule co\u00fbte 1 \u20ac de plus que le cochonnet. \u00bb Si on v\u00e9rifie : la boule \u00e0 1 \u20ac et le cochonnet \u00e0 10 centimes, \u00e7a fait 90 centimes de diff\u00e9rence et non pas 1 \u20ac. La solution est donc bien 1,10 \u20ac = 1,05 \u20ac + 0,05 \u20ac, et 1,05 \u20ac \u2013 0,05 \u20ac = 1 \u20ac. L'innovation p\u00e9dagogique La ma\u00eetrise de la connaissance n\u00e9cessaire et suffisante \u00e0 la r\u00e9alisation de la t\u00e2che n\u2019est pas pr\u00e9dictrice de la r\u00e9alisation effective de cette derni\u00e8re. C\u2019est la raison pour laquelle l\u2019approche par comp\u00e9tences nous semble int\u00e9ressante : la connaissance est insuffisante pour pr\u00e9dire la r\u00e9alisation de la t\u00e2che.

You can download the app or simply type this URL https://classroom.google.com/ in Safari. In fact, I suggest you do both as you will get some features only available in the app or your web browser. 1. What is Classroom? \u29eb To make it short, Google Classroom is a free service that aims to help teachers creating, distributing, and grading assignments. It is also designed to ease the process of sharing files between teachers and students. It is what one calls a LMS, which stands for Learning Management System . Some teachers prefer to use Google Site and therefore make a website to deliver their courses. You have to choose what better suits you! But do not forget, to quote Alice Keeler , that \u201cBy design, Google Classroom fosters interactions and collaboration\u201d. And indeed you will have a lot of opportunities to communicate with your students with Classroom you may not have through a website. 2. How to use Classroom? \u29eb Create a class \u29eb First of all, you need to create a class by pressing the big + on the right-left corner. You\u2019ll notice that you have two options: you can either create a class or join a class. For now, we just want to create a class but your students will join the class you created by pressing exactly the same button. Once you have created your class, you may want some students in it. So you have to invite them by providing a code you will find in the little cog icon located on the upright corner. Then, you\u2019ll find the code (or a URL if you prefer). \ud83d\udca1 Tip If you use Classroom in your web browser, you will be able to display the code in a way that even your furthest student will be able to see. Of course, you can still zoom in with your fingers on the screen of your iPad or with the remote of the projector. Delete or archive your class \u29eb At the end of the year, you have the choice to delete or archive your class (or you can do nothing which, in this particular case, can be an option to consider). But if you want to delete a class, first, you have to make an archive. To do that, go to your classes (by pressing the three little lines on the up left corner), choose your class and then press the three dots on the right corner of a class). If you want to delete a class, go to the Archives, choose your class, press the three dots and choose Delete . 3. Classroom and Drive \u29eb Be aware that when you create a class in Google Classroom, a folder in your Google Drive will be automatically created. Moreover, when you create an assignment, another folder will populate the main Classroom folder. In it, you will find the works of your students with their names automatically attached. It is very convenient and very useful in many cases. But we will tell more about that later. \u26a0\ufe0f It is highly recommended to not move these folders to another one.","title":"Google Classroom (part 1)"},{"location":"Documentation/Google/Google%20Classroom%20%28part%201%29/#1-what-is-classroom","text":"To make it short, Google Classroom is a free service that aims to help teachers creating, distributing, and grading assignments.

Classroom and Drive"},{"location":"Documentation/Google/Google%20Classroom%20%28part%202%29/","tags":["Tutorial","Google"],"text":"The user interface (UI) is very simple but keep in mind two things: Every UI\u2019s Google products is very simple. Nevertheless, they conceal many hidden features. Google loves to tweak the interface once in while. So if you wake up one morning and don\u2019t find this or that. Don\u2019t be surprised. You\u2019re not crazy. Google made some change. \ud83e\udd2a That being said, you\u2019ll find three tabs: Stream , Classwork & People (at least, in the iOS app). For the sake of simplicity and clarity, we will focus on the second tab (Classwork). And to be honest, most of the times, this is where you are going to spend most of your time in Classroom. Just to sum things up, the Stream tab allows you to have a quick view over what has been posted whether it is by you or a student. I do prefer the second tab where things can be organised (more about that down below \ud83d\udc47). The third one is a place where you can find all your students. Say you want to find a particular work of one of them or check if it has been duly submitted on time, the People tab is the right place. Among other things. \ud83d\udca1 Tip We found out that Google Classroom was the perfect place to work collaboratively between teachers when elaborating a mock exam. Simply create a new class and add a teacher. When everything\u2019s ready, share your class with your students. The Classwork tab \u29eb Create topics \u29eb What I appreciate in this middle tab is the possibility to add sections called \u201dTopics\u201d. See the + button (it\u2019s probably the only thing to locate)? Click on it and choose Topic . By creating topics, you will create different sections so that your stream is organised (remember the first tab?). You can even filter your topics in order to find the post you are looking for (and after six months of teaching it can be really difficult). To filter your topics, press the icon on the right up corner. \ud83d\udca1 Tip Want to move something? Just drag and drop it! Create an assignment \u29eb By pressing the + button, you have several options. The probably most used one is Assignment . While Question and Materials possess interesting possibilities, I prefer to create an assignment even if it\u2019s not one, even if I don\u2019t plan to grade anything. Why that? It allows you to have a private conversation with students. Now there are two things to consider when you create an assignment. Options to select when adding a doc to your assignment \u29eb When you insert a Google Docs (on which your students will find the questions or the work they have to do), you have three choices: Students can edit file Students can view file Make a copy for each student Whatever you choose, if you want your students to fill something up on the doc you provided, don\u2019t forget to select Students can edit file (and quite frankly, one out of two, I forget that option). Select students \u29eb You don\u2019t necessarily have to send an assignment to the entire class. If you want to differentiate, you can simply select the students to whom you want to send your assignment. Say you have three of them: an easy one, a medium one and a very difficult one. Select the students to whom you want to send the easy one and so forth. \ud83d\udca1 Tip If students send you some PDF, you can grade your student\u2019s work right on your iPad with Google Classroom. It\u2019s worth noticing it because usually, the browser version has more possibilities. In this case, it\u2019s the opposite. Moreover, if you have a stylus, you\u2019ll be able to grade those assignments exactly if it were paper. Question & Materials \u29eb Question \u29eb Insert a question in your classroom to ask something to your students: you may check if they understood your last lesson, you may want to know when they will feel ready for the next assessment or you can ask to vote. Last year, students had to debate and vote for the best debate, the most convincing idea and so on. In the last screenshot, you can see the results of the vote. Materials \u29eb It\u2019s the perfect place to put your textbook, your documents, a link often visited, a YouTube video, etc. Reuse post \u29eb Classroom offers you a great way to recycle your old posts and save a huge amount of time. Again, press the + button and choose Reuse post .

And you know what? We are going to keep that way because there is a lot to say again. We are going to talk about four awesome features. Let\u2019s start with notifications. 1. Notifications \u29eb When you start using Classroom, you will soon notice a tremendous amount of notifications. Notifications on your iPad (you know how this works): And notifications by mail! \ud83d\ude31 You may think this is too much. So get rid of the double warning. To do that, in Google Classroom, click on the three lines menu in the upper right, go to the bottom, choose Settings and then Notifications . And turn off whatever suits you. 2. Invite Guardians \u29eb This a possibility you only have in the web browser version. So you can invite guardians (that is to say the parents) just by writing their email address. They will not have access to Google Classroom but they will receive a summary of the activities posted on Google Classroom. Email summaries do not include grades. The summary includes: Missing work Upcoming work Class activity (Assignments, questions...) Guardians can get emails daily or weekly. 3. Schedule Assignments \u29eb This is an awesome feature for at least three reasons: You prepared some fancy stuff late at night for tomorrow but you don\u2019t want to wake up the all student\u2019s household with unwanted notifications. The following day, you know you won\u2019t have time to send the work to your students. Or worse! You could forget. \ud83d\ude31 You want to avoid distracting your students who are with another teacher. Every time, the answer is: schedule it! When you create an assignment, tap on the upper three dots and select Schedule . 4.

But that's not it. By doing so, you can preview its content. Even better, you can watch the video without ads and without leaving the tab. This is the so-called smart chip. Smart chips are \"interactive building blocks\" you can insert in a doc and that are linked to other parts of Google\u2019s office suite. Basically, it refers to essentially embedding other apps into Google Docs. To insert a chip, just type a @ symbol. It\u2019ll pop up a menu that will list a bunch of elements. You can type to narrow it down to the thing you want to include. Hit enter and it will make a smart chip. Here are a few examples. Type @today to insert the date (or @tomorrow\" or @yesterday and so on and so forth). The date becomes clickable and you can create an event in Calendar. Read Insert smart chips to get information on people, files, dates & events to learn more. Type @name to insert someone's name (instead of \"name\", type your contact name). it\u2019ll pop up a menu in which you'll be able to send an email, chat, start a video call, schedule an event... Type @document to link to a document (anything: a presentation, a sheet...). Instead of \"document\", just type the first letters of your document's title. There are many possibilities offered by smart chips. For instance, I really like to insert a draft of a mail (you can work collaboratively on this draft, then click on a button to open and send it in Gmail). I also like the dropdown menu option (see the screenshot down below) 1 . 02-05-2022 Google Docs adds customizable dropdown menus and table templates Meanwhile, Google Docs is also adding table templates to \u201cquickly insert building blocks for common workflows\u201d like a Launch content tracker, Project asset, Review tracker, and Product roadmap. Going hand-in-hand with the new dropdowns, these templates can be added from the Insert > Table menu. Videos About Smart Chips \u29eb At Google I/O the Smart Chips for Google docs were announced and they have finally arrived. You can now use the @-mention trick to add people, files, and events from your calendar. Even more functionality such as templates and checklists is rolling out! Exploring the new Smart Chips features to come out as a part of the new Google Canvas. This will look at the three different ways you can currently use these tags to make Google Docs more integrated and collaborative. To Read About Smart Chips and Hyperdocs \u29eb NEW GOOGLE SMART CHIPS TO LEVEL UP YOUR HYPERDOCS Providing your contact smart chip at the top or even as part of the header in your Hyperdocs gives students easy access to contact you in a variety of ways as they are working. This is so great for distance learning, although super beneficial even when you are hybrid or face-to-face. To Learn More About Google Technologies \u29eb Unleash collaboration with new experiences in Google Workspace Summaries in Google Docs Pageless format in Docs Interactive building blocks The current process is clunky, with collaborators crafting the email in a document editor, then manually porting it over to email. That\u2019s why we\u2019re making it easy to collaborate on an email draft in Docs with the new email draft template .

So I made this spreadsheet (though I have to confess that, at the beginning, I wanted to make a workshop dedicated to spreadsheets so participants could learn as many functions as possible). There are 18 sheets in this spreadsheet. I called the first one Home (\u201cAccueil\u201d in French). On this home page, you will find links to all the other sheets. On the last one, you will find support and explanation on how to use and modify them (sorry but it\u2019s in French). The other seventeen sheets are: Grade (term 1) Grade (term 2) Charts (term 1) Charts (term 2) Competences Assess participation (term 1) Assess participation (term 2) Comments Report (term 1) Report (term 2) Attendance Special Needs Accounts Create groups Student Picker Seating plan Depending on the sheet, you will find one link to Google Classroom and one link to Pronote. If needed, you will find the date and time as well. You can insert the date in many ways: To insert the date, press cmd or ctrl + ; (be sure to go to Help > Keyboard shortcuts and activate Enable compatible spreadsheet shortcuts ). To display a time or a date (which will be automatically updated every day), use the functions =NOW() or =DATE() . To format the date, head to Format > Number > Date . More on that in How to Add the Current Date and Time in Google Sheets . Grades & Competences \u29eb Enter your grades. The spreadsheet calculates the average. You get the lowest and highest grades or number of grades below, say, 10. Conditional formatting helps you figure out what are the overall results in a glimpse. Of course, you can filter these results. This means you can see only the grades below ten. More on that down below. The results can be browsed individually and show you a dynamic graphic as well. I use the box next to the chart to take notes when filling the reports. Here are the functions I used: =AVERAGE(B3:M3) \u2192 calculate the grade average =SUM(N4:W4) \u2192 Sum up numbers =SPARKLINE(B3:M3) \u2192 Sparklines are small, lightweight charts that exist inside a single cell (read How to Use Sparklines in Google Sheets or Everything you ever wanted to know about Sparklines in Google Sheets to learn more) =SPARKLINE($B50:$M50,{\"charttype\",\"bar\";\"max\",AVERAGE(B50:M50);\"color1\",\"#3C8CD6\";\"color2\",\"#F0EEEE\"})( to display a progress bar) =(B2) \u2192 avoid to write something twice =MAX(B3:B31) \u2192 display the highest grades =MIN(B3:B31) \u2192 display the lowest grades =COUNTIF(B$9:B$37, \"<10\") \u2192 Count only certain values =VLOOKUP($A50, $A3:$M31, 2, false) \u2192 extracts data from cell in specified column, using specified search key (watch and read How to Use VLOOKUP in Google Sheets & How to Find Data in Google Sheets with VLOOKUP to learn how to master these functions) To display the colors, use Conditional Formatting ( Format > Conditional Formatting ) It will colour certain items depending on the criteria you choose (ie A grade below 10). For grades, choose \u201cGreater than\u201d or \u201cLess than or Is equal to\u201d. For assessing participation (see down below), pick \u201cText is exactly\u201d. Charts \u29eb With charts, results become more visual. You can create a chart for each assessment or a chart for all the results during the term ( Insert > Chart ). If you need help with charts, have a look at this page: Add & edit a chart or graph . You may also want to watch one of these videos on YouTube . Assess participation \u29eb Quickly assess participation by selecting in a drop-down menu the appropriate observation. A grade is automatically generated accordingly. To create a dropdown menu (fastest way to insert data), use Data Validation ( Data > Data Validation ) and choose \u201cList of items\u201d (or \u201cNumber\u201d if you prefer). I also use Data Validation for filling reports (have a look at Create a drop-down list where the list is separate sentences that include commas ). As I want to automatically grade participation during class, I use an IF function. Basically, if a student is doing a great job (excellent participation for instance), he or she gets two points. To know more about the IF function, read this . It should look something like this: =IF(B4=\"tr\u00e8s bonne participation\", 2, 1) As we have multiple conditions, we need nested if: =IF(logical_expression, value_if_true, IF(logical_expression, value_if_true, IF(logical_expression, value_if_true, value_if_false ) ) ) =IF(B7=\"tr\u00e8s bonne participation\", 2, IF(B7=\"bonne participation\", 1, IF(B7=\"suit mais ne participe pas\", 0.5, 0 ) ) ) As there is no need to display the calculation, some rows have been hidden. To learn how to hide a row or column in a Google Spreadsheet, read this article . Reports \u29eb Produce a full report by selecting your appreciation in a ready-made bank. Then you just have to copy and paste the whole thing. I also take notes on a daily basis so that the process of writing an appreciation runs throughout the whole period. My final appreciation becomes more accurate and feels more personal. To do that, I made a bank of observations (see screenshot down below). When selecting a student, a drop-down menu (made with Data Validation ) takes these observations providing your criteria is \u201cList from a range\u201d. All the observations will be concatenated in one cell: =CONCATENATE(B4,\" \",C4,\" \",D4,\" \",E4,\" \",F4,\" \",G4,\" \",H4,\" \",I4,\" \",J4,\" \",K4) Attendance \u29eb Imagine you are out of school with your students (when the pandemic\u2019s over of course). You want to make the roll call quite quickly so you don\u2019t want or can\u2019t launch Pronote. But you can share the sheet with the vie scolaire. Very handy during a fire drill. All you have to do is create checkboxes (by the way, have a look at the last possibility at the end of the article. Very interesting). So, go to Insert > Checkbox . When the checkbox is unticked, it is FALSE . When ticked, it\u2019s TRUE . Use Conditional Formatting to make them green or red (or whatever color you want) if a student is missing or not. In \u201cFormat rules\u201d, choose \u201cCustom formula is\u201d and type (for instance) = $B2:B30 = TRUE or = $B2:B30 = FALSE ). Then choose the colour. You can add a \u201cFilter view\u201d so you can display only the students missing. To create a filter , head to Data > Create a filter . Special needs \u29eb Like I said at the beginning of this article, I want everything to be in one place. So I used the IMPORTRANGE function to import on my spreadsheet the content of another spreadsheet. You won\u2019t find it on this spreadsheet but lately, I added several tabs using the IMPORTRANGE function to gather information provided by my students (they have their own spreadsheet where they say what they are doing). It\u2019s a long story to explain but if you read French you can learn more about that by reading this article or this presentation . For now, you just need to know that you can monitor the progress of your students quite easily: they can tell you what exercise they\u2019ve done, if they need help or if they can move on to the next step and why not? ask for an assessment. This is all about autonomous work so everyone is working at its own pace. To know more about this function, please refer to Google's documentation . It looks like this: =IMPORTRANGE(\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/abcd123abcd123\", \"sheet1!A1:C10\") You just specify the URL of the spreadsheet and say where is the data you want to import (on which sheet, which rows). Seating plan \u29eb My colleague Jean showed me this nice trick. Using the INDEX / MATCH functions, you can create a seating plan. Very handy when you want to place students randomly and mix them up a little. This may surprise you, but to do that you need three sheets. On the first one (the sheet is labelled \u201cListe\u201d), you will find a list of your students. For each student, a random number is allocated. Using Filters, you can change the order of the names so they are mixed up. To assign a random number use this function: =RAND() (it returns a random number between 0 inclusive and 1 exclusive). On the second one (\u201cTables\u201d), you have a simple sitting plan with only numbers. Finally, on the third one (\u201cPlan\u201d), you have the same sitting plan but (and this is where the magic happens) but instead of numbers, you have a function using INDEX and MATCH . It places random students! So the function is: =INDEX(Liste!$B$2:$B$30,MATCH(Tables!F5,Liste!$A$2:$A$30)) What it does is simply using two functions in one: INDEX then MATCH . INDEX returns the content of a cell specified by row and column offset. MATCH returns the relative position of an item in a range that matches a specified value (see How to Use INDEX and MATCH together ). Since we only need the list of the students and the sitting plan, we hide the second tab (the one named \u201cTables\u201d). To hide a sheet, follow these steps: Create groups \u29eb Following the same method as mentioned above, you can create groups of 2 to 6 students. Therefore, we have three sheets: But, as I was able to put everything I needed on one sheet, I chose to hide the two others. Indeed, there is enough room to display everything we need on one single sheet. With an IF function (if I select the number 3 to create groups of 3 students), I can display the automatically generated groups on one of the hidden spreadsheets. To import the content of another sheet, I used ARRAYFORMULA . Remember that IMPORT RANGE can fetch data located on another spreadsheet. ARRAYFORMULA can bring over data that are on another sheet (keep in mind that a spreadsheet has multiple sheets or tabs). Pick a student randomly \u29eb Following this tutorial , I was able to create this random picker with three functions. I wanted to insert an animated gif but alas it does not work. The three functions are: RANDBETWEEN COUNTA INDEX You already know INDEX . So there is COUNTA which counts all values in a data set, including those which appear more than once and text values (including zero-length strings and whitespace). To count unique values, use COUNTUNIQUE . To count only numeric values use COUNT . And there is RANDBETWEEN ( =RANDBETWEEN() ). It generates a random number. We saw that RAND returns a random number between 0 and 1. RANDBETWEEN returns a number between 1 and whatever you want (read How to Use RAND and RANDBETWEEN Functions in Google Sheets to learn more about that). To know how to combine these functions to create your name picker, have a look at the aforementioned tutorial. Conclusion \u29eb I\u2019m not a spreadsheet specialist and I\u2019m pretty sure you must have plenty of ideas of what we could do with a spreadsheet to not only track students' progress but to assess them as accurately as possible and help them become autonomous students as well. You have probably noticed that there is no script at all in this spreadsheet. That\u2019s because I\u2019m terrible at Google Script but that\u2019s also because I wanted this file to be as light and fast as possible. But, again, maybe you\u2019ll have skills and ideas that I don\u2019t. So I can\u2019t wait to read your suggestions. On top of that, keep in mind we can automate things using Zapier for instance. I don\u2019t have a subscription so I can\u2019t really use it but as I played with it, I was able to see the potential (for instance, if I take attendance, send automatically an email to the school so they know everyone is here during our little trip in town). Again, let me know what you think!","title":"Tracking Students\u2019 Progress"},{"location":"Documentation/Google/Tracking%20Students%E2%80%99%20Progress/#grades-competences","text":"Enter your grades.

In Criteria , select List of items . Insert a list of items separated by commas. Click Save. Alternatively, you may create your list on a separate sheet. That way, it may be easier to read or to update it, especially if you have a long list. Then, in Data validation , write a formula like =LIST!B2:B (meaning your list is on the LIST sheet in column B). You can even hide the sheet (click on the little arrow and choose Hide sheet ).

Wouldn\u2019t it be nice to have an assistant that can intuitively help us with our work, so that we can speed it up? The Explore feature in Google Sheets does exactly that. It intelligently gathers the context that we are working upon, and gives us the right suggestions that might be suitable for the purpose. And its insightful suggestions include tips for formatting, charting, pivot tables etc. If we can\u2019t find something, we can even ask for answers. ( Link ) SPLIT \u29eb Go to Data > Split text to columns . Use the space separator if you want to split first and last names. Or use the Split function : =SPLIT(A2,\" \") . In the case of Last, First you want the last name in one cell and the first name in another cell. What is preventing you from doing that is a comma AND A SPACE!!! It\u2019s so easy to miss realizing the space between the names. If the name is in A2 then in B2 (or any blank cell) I start with an equals sign and put =SPLIT( and then click on A2 so it automatically is added to my formula. Put a comma. IN QUOTATIONS put the delineator. In this case it is \u201c, \u201d [...]. Google Sheets: Split Up Student Names Want to copy and paste the values? cmd (or ctrl) + shift + v (or right click > Paste special > Values only ). CONCATENATE \u29eb Concatenate data from multiple cells =CONCATENATE(B2,\" \",C2) SORT \u29eb Option 1 \u29eb Highlight the group of cells you'd like to sort. If your sheet includes a header row, freeze the first row ( View > Freeze ). Click Data > Sort range > Advanced range sorting options . If your columns have titles, click Data has header row .

Option 2 \u29eb =FILTER(A2:B13,B2:B13<10) (only displays grades below 10 in column B3 to B31) Date \u29eb You can insert the date in many ways. Enter the date with a shortcut \u29eb To insert the date, press cmd or ctrl + ; (be sure to go to Help > Keyboard shortcuts and activate Enable compatible spreadsheet shortcuts ). Enter the date using DATE() or NOW() \u29eb To display a time or a date (which will be automatically updated every day when you open up your spreadsheet), use the functions =DATE() (receive three arguments) or =NOW() (provides date and time). To create a date without the current time, use TODAY . Display the time \u29eb To only display the time, use TIME() (three arguments) Documentation (DATE) Documentation (NOW) Documentation (TIME) Examples \u29eb DATE \u29eb DATE(1969,7,20) (year, month, day) DATE(A2,B2,C2) To format the date, head to Format > Number > Date . To customise the format, go to Format > Number > Custom date and time formats . Want the date of every week? Just enter the date manually (say in A9). In the next cell, type =A9+7 . TIME \u29eb TIME(11,40,59) (hour, minute, second) TIME(A2,B2,C2) IF \u29eb Demo Simple IF \u29eb =IF(test, value_if_true, value_if_false) If you want to run a logical test in a Google Sheets formula, providing different results whether the test is TRUE or FALSE , you\u2019ll need to use the IF function. As the name suggests, IF is used to test whether a single cell or range of cells meets certain criteria in a logical test, where the result is always either TRUE or FALSE. If the IF test is TRUE, then Google Sheets will return a number or text string , perform a calculation , or run through another formula . If the result is FALSE, it\u2019ll do something completely different. You can combine IF with other logical functions like AND and OR or with other nested IF statements. How to Use the Google Sheets IF Function Documentation Using IF with AND and OR \u29eb To use IF AND, type =IF(AND(AND Argument 1, AND Argument 2), value_if_true, value_if_false) To use IF OR, type =IF(OR(OR Argument 1, OR Argument 2), value_if_true, value_if_false) As the IF function performs logical tests, with TRUE or FALSE results, it\u2019s possible to nest other logical functions like AND and OR into an IF formula. This allows you to run an initial test with multiple criteria. The AND function requires all test criteria to be correct for a TRUE result to be shown. OR requires only one of the test criteria to be correct for a TRUE result. How to Use the Google Sheets IF Function Nested IF Statements \u29eb =IF(first_test, value_if_true, IF(second_test, value_if_true, value_if_false)) =IF(first_test, value_if_true, IF(second_test, value_if_true, IF(third_test, value_if_true, value_if_false ) ) ) COUNTIF \u29eb Count how many items in a range meet a given criterion. Syntax: COUNTIF(range, criterion) Documentation Examples \u29eb =COUNTIF(A1:A9, \"Coffee\") (count how many coffee there are) The range is A1:A9 . The criterion is Coffee . =COUNTIF(B14:G14, \"<10\") (count how many grades below 10) The range is B14:G14 . The criterion is <10 . COUNTIF can only perform conditional counts with a single criterion. To use multiple criteria, use COUNTIFS ( link ). SUMIF \u29eb What is the sum if we are talking of a specific item? Syntax: SUMIF(range, criterion, [sum_range]) Documentation Example \u29eb =SUMIF(A2:A9, \"Taxi\", B2:B9) (says how much I spent for taxi, i.e. in A2:A9 , if there is \"Taxi\", what's the sum in B2:B9 ?)","title":"Training Google Sheets"},{"location":"Documentation/Google/Training%20Google%20Sheets/#exercises","text":"File's link File's link with solutions","title":"Exercises"},{"location":"Documentation/Google/Training%20Google%20Sheets/#exercise-1-tickdata-validation","text":"Create a pop-up calendar date picker.

There are different combinations . As a response to the pandemic, the most common hybrid model groups students and alternate days on-site and off-site . Combining Online & On-site Learning \u29eb Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday Friday Group A On Site Remote On Site Remote On Site Group B Remote On Site Remote On Site Remote Synchronous & Asynchronous learning \u29eb Synchronicity means everyone is doing something at the same time, in the same room, learning the same thing . That's what synchronous learning is. Asynchronous is the opposite: students and the teacher are not engaged in the process at the same time, there is no real-time interaction . And no-one is in the same space. But we can take advantage of that: using breakout rooms for instance. Teachers are not dealing with 20 to 30 students in the same space at the same time. It's an opportunity to make everyone work at his/her own pace, on specific and differentiated topics. Teachers can deal with them as individuals with no one interfering. ( Everything you need to know about remote teaching ) Hybrid schedules often use a combination of both. Students who are off-site work asynchronously and students who physically present engage in a synchronous way . Combining Online & On-site Learning With Synchronous & Asynchronous \u29eb Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday Friday Remote Asynchronous On-Site Synchronous Remote Asynchronous On-Site Synchronous Remote Asynchronous Teaching synchronously to both in-person and remote students \u29eb At the time of this writing, this is how we are doing hybrid learning . But, in fact, we have very few students attending from home. It\u2019s a completely different story if you have to deal with a lot of students whether they are working from home and working at school. Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday Friday On Site & Remote On Site & Remote On Site & Remote On Site & Remote On Site & Remote The workload for the teachers should be acceptable if students learning from home work asynchronously while students physically present have to work synchronously . Indeed, being attentive to both remote and in-person students can be very challenging. Appointment Slots in Google Calendar \u29eb Students online must be able to talk to their teacher when they need to: in Google Calendar > Appointment slots (very convenient to book an appointment) in Google Groups (a group class discussion fostering collaboration and peer support) Provide your Zoom link \u29eb Head to zoom.us > Meetings > Personal Room and get Invite Link .

You\u2019ll see a detailed list of your attendees including the exact time they logged on and off. Google Classroom \u29eb Just ask a simple question (scheduled it). How to help students with remote learning? \u29eb While teachers are teaching to students physically presents, we may imagine two different scenarios: Teachers answer students whether they attend online or in-person. The course is live-streamed and everyone can participate in real-time. In addition, students at home can collaborate with students in the classroom. Teachers can not answer to students attending online. They are too busy. But we can provide coaches (the teachers who are not teaching but are covering any potential absent teachers and are ready to replace him or her). We could have an online CTL helping students working from home. In fact, a student working from home has a coach. A student working from school has a teacher. Of course, all lessons are created by the classroom teacher and posted on Google Classroom. Instructions too. Assignments are graded by this teacher. But it is the coach that helps online students (only it\u2019s not feasible by the teacher him/herself during class. It depends). Who wants hybrid learning? \u29eb Students having extracurricular activities (athletic careers, music) Students with special needs experimenting anxiety Students having medical conditions Students that have been homeschooled Any absence, snowdays should be addressed thanks to online classes. How to inform students and parents about hybrid learning? \u29eb Induction day (both for parents and students) Welcome students attending online (Zoom meeting) Parents \u29eb Declaration of Learning Models 2021-2022 (At Thames Valley, parents are being asked to indicate which type of learning they're interested in putting their children in for the coming school year): Please note that the learning model you choose is for the full 2021-22 school year. Large movements of students between In-Person Learning and Full-Remote Learning can cause considerable disruptions to many students, including those who are not changing learning model themselves. Therefore, your choice of In-Person Learning or Full-Remote Learning will represent a full-year commitment. Make a document to explain parents the difference between in-person and online learning so they can make a choice.

On ne peut l'ignorer ou balayer cette id\u00e9e d\u2019un revers de manche. Le monde change. Il est en pleine mutation. Et apr\u00e8s un Brexit, une pand\u00e9mie, une guerre en cours, une crise climatique, tout le monde en conviendra. L\u2019\u00e9cole change donc \u00e9galement ou doit changer si ce n'est pas le cas. C'est quelque chose que j'ai lu souvent. Par exemple, on dit qu'on a r\u00e9ussi la massification de l'enseignement. On dit alors qu'il faut maintenant gagner celui de la qualit\u00e9. Ou encore qu'il faut faire entrer le num\u00e9rique dans l'\u00e9cole, que l'enseignement des 3 R (writing, arithmetics, reading) ne sont plus suffisants, qu'il faut de surcro\u00eet enseigner les 4 C, etc. De fait, il faut innover. Si, par innovation, on entend la volont\u00e9 de faire progresser tous les \u00e9l\u00e8ves ou encore de faire entrer le num\u00e9rique \u00e0 l'\u00e9cole (formule un peu creuse, juste un raccourci), je vote pour. Mais les choses sont peut-\u00eatre plus compliqu\u00e9es que cela. Il faut d\u00e9finir l'innovation et comprendre les probl\u00e8mes pos\u00e9es par une telle revendication, non pas pour tout rejeter en bloc, mais pour mieux appr\u00e9hender les choses et faire des choix. Voil\u00e0 d\u00e9j\u00e0 une premi\u00e8re confusion \u00e0 corriger : l'innovation appelle au changement, mais elle n'est pas synonyme de changement. On verra pourquoi par la suite. Reste que l'injonction \u00e0 innover peut laisser perplexe. On n'innove pas pour innover. Employ\u00e9 absolument, le verbe ne veut rien dire. On veut, par exemple, innover pour am\u00e9liorer les r\u00e9sultats de ses \u00e9l\u00e8ves. On veut \u00eatre plus juste, pour lutter contre les in\u00e9galit\u00e9s par exemple. Qu'est-ce que l'innovation ? \u29eb C'est assez amusant comme ce mot est \u00e0 la fois facile et difficile \u00e0 d\u00e9finir. Lorsqu'il se rapporte \u00e0 l'industrie, c'est facile. Apple est une entreprise innovante. Elle cr\u00e9e l'iPod puis l'iPhone et enfin l'iPad, et bouleverse le march\u00e9. M\u00eame chose avec Sony ou IBM qui ont, en leur temps, boulevers\u00e9 un march\u00e9 domin\u00e9 par des entreprises qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 m\u00e9chamment malmen\u00e9es par les challengers susmentionn\u00e9s. Mais, en \u00e9ducation, qu'est-ce qu'une innovation ? Il me semble qu'une exp\u00e9rience comme the hole in the wall de Sugata Mitra est une entreprise fondamentalement innovante. Donner un acc\u00e8s \u00e0 l'ordinateur \u00e0 des enfants vivant dans un bidon ville, leur en laisser un acc\u00e8s complet, sans intervention aucune de l'adulte et constater la nature \u00e9mergeante du savoir \u00e9tait extraordinaire. Mais l'enseignant comme vous et moi peut-il innover dans sa classe ? Je ne parle pas d'inverser la classe cinq \u00e0 dix ans apr\u00e8s que de r\u00e9els innovateurs l'aient mis en place pour la premi\u00e8re fois, je parle r\u00e9ellement d'innover, c'est-\u00e0-dire de faire quelque chose de nouveau dans une pratique \u00e9tablie (transmettre un savoir \u00e0 une classe d'\u00e2ge dans un lieu donn\u00e9). R\u00e9ponse ??? L\u2019innovation, c\u2019est aussi un sujet complexe et m\u00eame inqui\u00e9tant. C\u2019est un exercice int\u00e9ressant d\u2019\u00e9quilibre entre l\u2019Ancien et le Nouveau, entre h\u00e9ritage et renouvellement, entre modernit\u00e9 et tradition. Aujourd'hui, c'est un processus per\u00e7u comme extr\u00eamement positif. Alors qu'au Moyen \u00c2ge, l'innovation constituait une transgression, un bouleversement de l'ordre \u00e9tabli con\u00e7u comme immuable. Ce n'est qu'ensuite qu'il a \u00e9t\u00e9 vu comme un progr\u00e8s. D\u00e8s les Lumi\u00e8res, c'est une am\u00e9lioration des conditions de vie. C'est un levier d'\u00e9mancipation de l'homme. Miroitent les perspectives d'un bien-\u00eatre dont la publicit\u00e9 serait aujourd'hui probablement un exemple troublant : tous ces nouveaux produits qui feront de vous un individu combl\u00e9 et moderne. Mais l\u2019innovation est bien souvent l\u2019occasion d\u2019un recyclage. On fait du neuf avec du vieux comme dit Andr\u00e9 Tricot 1 . L'\u00e9tymologie, in-novare , indique que cela consiste \u00e0 introduire du nouveau dans quelque chose qui est d\u00e9j\u00e0 l\u00e0, qui pr\u00e9existe et va \u00eatre transform\u00e9. Ma culture litt\u00e9raire m'inviterait \u00e0 d\u00e9finir alors l'innovation comme une transgression de l'ancien. Il faut conna\u00eetre ses classiques pour \u00eatre moderne. C'est un peu ce que fait Baudelaire en son temps : introduire des sujets modernes (la ville par exemple) dans des po\u00e8mes de facture assez classique (le sonnet notamment). J.-C. Cailliez 2 ne dit pas autre chose, mais s'appuyant sur la musique : \u00ab Ne dit-on pas que les meilleurs jazzmans sont ceux qui connaissent leurs gammes ? Il en est de m\u00eame pour les enseignants lorsqu\u2019ils d\u00e9cident de quitter le 100% de cours magistraux pour innover \u00bb. Puisqu'on est dans le domaine des arts, cela me rappelle aussi un peu cette croyance du Grand Si\u00e8cle, qu'on arrive trop tard, que tout a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait, que les Anciens ont tout dit. Ils ne nous laissent que la possibilit\u00e9 de les imiter, dit La Fontaine. Et en un sens, tout a d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 fait en mati\u00e8re d'\u00e9ducation. En termes de p\u00e9dagogie, il va \u00eatre tr\u00e8s difficile d'innover (s'appuyer sur Tricot) Emmanuel Davidenkoff nous le rappelle dans Le Tsunami num\u00e9rique 4 : H\u00e9rodote et \u00c9rasme pratiquaient la learning expedition\u2008; un directeur de conscience n\u2019a pas grand-chose \u00e0 envier \u00e0 un coach\u2008; le serio ludere du Quattrocento italien pr\u00e9figure les serious games du XXI e si\u00e8cle\u2008; C\u00e9lestin Freinet n\u2019avait pas besoin de Twitter pour faire correspondre les \u00e9l\u00e8ves\u2008; la flipped classroom (classe invers\u00e9e) avec son \u00ab professeur-pr\u00e9cepteur\u2008\u00bb n\u2019est pas tr\u00e8s \u00e9loign\u00e9e du fonctionnement du lyc\u00e9e du XIX e si\u00e8cle Mais ce qui est vrai pour le domaine p\u00e9dagogique est-il vrai pour tout ce qui a trait \u00e0 l'\u00e9ducation. Non, bien s\u00fbr. Pour diverses raisons. Celle qui me tient \u00e0 c\u0153ur est certainement celle des si mal nomm\u00e9s \u00ab outils num\u00e9riques \u00bb qui ne peuvent ainsi d\u00e9sign\u00e9s qu'en tant qu'ils permettent de faire peut \u00eatre mieux mais faire ce qu'on faisait d\u00e9j\u00e0 avant. Or le \u00ab num\u00e9rique \u00bb nous impose de faire de nouvelles choses. Il permet de faire des choses qu'on ne faisait pas avant. La n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 d'enseigner les 4C le montre bien (\u00e0 d\u00e9velopper). Il y a aussi cette id\u00e9e qu'on n'innove pas tout seul. C'est la raison pour laquelle il faut apprendre \u00e0 travailler ensemble (voir les 4C encore). Les grandes innovations sont le produit d'\u00e9quipe. Internet en est un bel exemple. Mais l'innovation, c\u2019est aussi un mod\u00e8le port\u00e9 par l\u2019industrie (la Silicon Valley notamment) qui d\u00e9clare le pass\u00e9 comme obsol\u00e8te voire cass\u00e9 et le futur charg\u00e9 de promesses (\u00ab Think different \u00bb ,\u00ab Make the world a better a place \u00bb...). En fait, impossible de s\u00e9parer innovation et \u00e9conomie. Dans son livre Creating Innovators 3 , Tony Wagner \u00e9voque dans sa pr\u00e9face la crise de 2008 et ses cons\u00e9quences sur l'\u00e9conomie. C'est la sant\u00e9 de l'\u00e9conomie qui doit g\u00e9n\u00e9rer l'innovation : The long-term health of our economy and a full economic recovery are dependent upon creating far more innovation. New or improved ideas, products, and services create wealth and new jobs. Ce qui n'est pas compl\u00e8tement scandaleux. Apr\u00e8s tout, l'\u00e9ducation n'a pas pour unique but de vous sensibiliser aux subtilit\u00e9s des r\u00e8gles de la versification au XVI e si\u00e8cle, mais aussi \u00e9ventuellement de vous donner un travail. Toutefois, Wagner ajoute : Most leaders agree on one thing, however. The long-term health of our economy and a full economic recovery are dependent upon creating far more innovation. New or improved ideas, products, and services create wealth and new jobs. Business leaders, in particular, say that we need many more young people who can create innovations in the areas of science, technology, and engineering. En fait, on a ici un programme \u00e9ducatif dont l'objectif est de soigner l'\u00e9conomie. \u00c9videmment, cela forme un cycle, puisqu'en retour, l'\u00e9conomie nourrit ceux qui participent \u00e0 son d\u00e9veloppement. L'urgence est d'autant \u00e9vidente que la menace de l'automatisation est une invitation \u00e0 rendre les gens plus comp\u00e9tents dans les domaines de la technologie afin qu'ils puissent faire ce que les machines ne sont pas en mesure de faire. En somme, pourquoi pas ? Malheureusement, la comp\u00e9tition \u00e9conomique est souvent l'envers d'un discours nationaliste. Cf. Obama : In America, innovation doesn\u2019t just change our lives. It\u2019s how we make a living. We need to out-innovate, out-educate and out-build the rest of the world.\u201d (https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/State_of_the_Union/state-of-the-union-2011-full-transcript/story?id=12759395) Pourquoi innove-t-on ? Le fait que l'innovation a pour but de trouver des solutions aux probl\u00e8mes d'aujourd'hui. Peut-on enseigner l'innovation ? La cr\u00e9ativit\u00e9 ? Et dans quelle mati\u00e8re ? En lisant Wagner, on voit bien que l'innovation n'existerait essentiellement que dans les sciences, la technologie, les maths, l'ing\u00e9nierie. Toutefois, l\u2019innovation ne peut vendre du neuf que sur une courte p\u00e9riode de temps. Le neuf ne dure pas. Il peut m\u00eame devenir tradition. Et la tradition devenir innovation. Voir plus haut (ou plus bas ?). Ce processus de renouvellement \u00e9voque un cycle naturel : ascension/chute, croissance/d\u00e9cadence, floraison/fl\u00e9trissure\u2026 Il faut alors renouveler en permanence. C\u2019est en fait un processus \u00e9conomique (la fameuse cr\u00e9ation destructrice de Schumpeter, le renouvellement permanent d\u00e9truisant l\u2019ancien). Il repose sur une peur de l\u2019effondrement financier et de la fin du capitalisme. Et je suis frapp\u00e9 en lisant George Couros 5 , Davidenkoff, Christensen, etc. de constater que tous \u00e9voquent un commerce (Kodak, Blockbuster) qui n\u2019a pas su percevoir les changements et ont provoqu\u00e9 leur effondrement. Crainte d\u2019une \u00e9cole qui subirait le m\u00eame sort. L\u2019innovation \u00ab disruptive \u00bb a donc pour but de d\u00e9truire le vieux pour faire du neuf. C\u2019est le discours marketing que vous connaissez bien (la fin du monde tel qu\u2019on le connait, Rien ne sera plus comme avant\u2026). Vous l'avez entendu \u00e0 chaque pr\u00e9sentation, chaque keynote, chaque d\u00e9claration de CEO de la Silicon Valley. Tout doit \u00eatre \u00ab perturb\u00e9 \u00bb : l\u2019\u00e9cole, la sant\u00e9, l\u2019urbanisme\u2026 Jamais assez nouveau : NASA's new innovation could help get humans to Mars by 2040 | Mashable (\"new innovatio\") Pour plagier Jill Lepore 6 , le 18 e si\u00e8cle a adopt\u00e9 l'id\u00e9e de progr\u00e8s, le 19 e si\u00e8cle a connu l'\u00e9volution, le 20 e la croissance puis l'innovation. Notre \u00e9poque conna\u00eet la \u00ab disruption \u00bb. Pas de bol. Il ne s'agit plus seulement d'innover. En fait, l'innovation n'est plus assez. C'est la voracit\u00e9 capitaliste, mais voyons les choses du bon c\u00f4t\u00e9. C\u2019est aussi une tension qui semble s\u00e9duire, qui stimule la r\u00e9flexion et qui semble vieille comme le monde : ancien et nouveau testament, querelle des anciens et des modernes, digital natives vs boomers\u2026 Je trouve cette tension entre tradition, h\u00e9ritage et modernit\u00e9, adaptation, transformation assez fascinante. En somme, on est toujours sur le fil du choix \u00e0 faire, dans un monde en p\u00e9ril ou changeant en permanence. Profitons-en pour rappeler un truisme. Le changement est l\u2019ordre du monde. C\u2019est l\u2019id\u00e9e de permanence qui est illusoire. Merci H\u00e9raclite. En somme, on n'a pas le choix. C'est ce que nous rappelle Fran\u00e7oise Cros et Dominique Broussal dans Changement et innovation en \u00e9ducation : deux notions en r\u00e9sonance 7 . [L\u2019innovation a aussi une implication religieuse : sauver le monde, r\u00e9demption \u00e9conomique et annonce de lendemains meilleurs. ] \u00c9voquer aussi Ken Robinson in Out of our minds (innovation comme imp\u00e9ratif humain) : Biologically, we are probably evolving at the same rate as other species: in cultural terms, we have always evolved at a uniquely furious rate. So far as we can tell, the cultural lives of dogs and cats are not changing that much. Left to their own devices, they seem to be doing what they have always done and to be pre-occupied with the same sorts of things. There is no need to keep checking in with them to see what\u2019s new. In human life, there is always something new, because creativity is part of what it is to be human. L\u2019innovation exerce sa fascination, disais-je. Mais c'est une fascination l\u00e9gitime. Il y a un d\u00e9fi \u00e0 innover, \u00e0 bouleverser les pratiques, \u00e0 chercher \u00ab l'or du temps \u00bb, \u00e0 \u00ab \u00eatre absolument moderne \u00bb, \u00e0 \u00e9pouser les transformations du monde, \u00e0 ne pas sombrer dans un pass\u00e9isme idol\u00e2tre, \u00e0 ne pas s'effrayer de la nouveaut\u00e9, mais aussi \u00e0 ne pas s'en laisser compter par les sir\u00e8nes de l'industrie et du marketing. Mais cela est-il possible ? Peut-on \u00ab disrupter \u00bb l'\u00e9ducation comme on perturbe le domaine de la sant\u00e9 ou de la t\u00e9l\u00e9phonie ? Un Justin Reich r\u00e9pondrait que non, que la technologie ne domestique pas l'\u00e9ducation mais que c'est le contraire. Notez que Diana Laurillard 8 dit non \u00e9galement. Transformer l'industrie, le syst\u00e8me bancaire en un sens est ais\u00e9. Transformer la fa\u00e7on on apprend et on enseigne est une toute autre affaire. People are fond of pointing out that the nineteenth-century time traveller would be astonished by our banks, factories, and operating theatres \u2013 all transformed by new technology \u2013 while the classroom has hardly changed. However, bankers, industrialists, and surgeons have had huge resources devoted to developing the specialised systems they need for transformation. Teachers have not. Yet it is a much more tractable problem to model the activity that moves a credit from one account to another than to model the activity that moves a mind from confusion to understanding. Governments provide education with the tools developed for industry and commerce, but who is there to help teachers and lecturers work out how to use them to transform teaching and learning? Pourtant beaucoup souhaitent bouleverser le syst\u00e8me \u00e9ducatif. J'en ai encore trouv\u00e9 un exemple sur Twitter tr\u00e8s r\u00e9cemment. Cf capture d'\u00e9cran (r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 retrouver) Reflect on a major disruptor that you have witnessed during your life (e.g., Uber, iPhone, Netflix, TikTok, Airbnb, etc.). What lessons can be applied to spark needed changes to education? https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5eb9b365d2446e64333aec15/t/60ed91aef67381323ef96b2a/1626182062517/Disruptive+Study+Guide.pdf L'id\u00e9e est que si Uber a \u00ab disrupt\u00e9 \u00bb l'\u00e9conomie, il doit bien se trouver une entreprise quelque part pour modifier en profondeur l'\u00e9ducation. Et de fait, permettre \u00e0 ceux qui le feront de gagner des sommes colossales. C'est ce qu'on annonce depuis des ann\u00e9es. 2009 en fait avec Disruptive class de Clayton Christensen. Je ne sais pas si c'est utile d'expliquer pourquoi une uberisation de l'\u00e9ducation serait malvenue. On peut toutefois l\u00e9gitimement se demander en quoi la volont\u00e9 disruptive mentionn\u00e9e pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment est si mauvaise. Apr\u00e8s tout, on parle de changement, de croissance, etc. (vocabulaire de l'entreprise). Pas bien ? Le fait est que toutes les annonces de disruption se sont toutes sold\u00e9es par un \u00e9chec. \u00c9voquer Clayton Christensen (citation de Reich 9 ) In 2008, Harvard Business School professor Clayton Christensen, with colleagues Michael Horn and Curtis Johnson, published Disrupting Class, a book about online learning and the future of K\u201312 schools. They predicted that by 2019, half of all middle- and high-school courses would be replaced by online options, and \u201cthe cost will be one-third of today\u2019s costs, and the courses will be much better.\u201dThese dramatic changes would be driven by innovators in education technology, or edtech. La \u00ab disruption \u00bb du syst\u00e8me scolaire ne peut \u00eatre qu'incr\u00e9mentale. C'est un changement progressif, lent. Et surtout au c\u0153ur de forces contradictoires. Citation de Reich. Schools are complex systems, and many stakeholders in school systems\u2014teachers, students, parents, administrators, and policymakers\u2014are often quite committed to various aspects of the status quo. The schools that exist today are an assemblage of features designed to balance competing visions of the purpose of schooling: inspiring lifelong learning, helping learners pass through gatekeeping exams, preparing people for their lives as citizens. As a result of these varied purposes, schools are tasked with an almost inconceivable array of often competing functions [...] Mais l'innovation peut-elle se d\u00e9cr\u00e9ter ? Peut-elle \u00eatre minist\u00e9rielle ? Institutionnalis\u00e9e ? Non, si on entend normaliser la cr\u00e9ativit\u00e9 des enseignants et les pousser \u00e0 un renouvellement permanent. Ce serait un peu comme avec l'imp\u00e9ratif du verbe \u00ab pouvoir \u00bb. Il n'existe pas. Oui, si l'on veut que le pouvoir politique agisse avec force, mais \u00e0 condition que l'injonction \u00e0 innover ne soit pas du seul ressort des enseignants. Et il s'agit plus d'une invitation, mindset (cf Couros), non pas tout changer mais accompagner enseignants d'un point a \u00e0 un point b. Innover serait alors pour l'\u00c9ducation nationale de mieux payer ses enseignants, de mettre fin \u00e0 la crise du recrutement, etc. Si j'\u00e9tais ministre, mon innovation \u00e0 moi serait de permettre aux enseignants de cr\u00e9er du contenu libre par exemple. Ou encore de revoir l'architecture des classes qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 pens\u00e9 pour les si\u00e8cles pass\u00e9s et dans lesquelles malheureusement l'air est irrespirable en ces p\u00e9riodes de chaleur. Pourquoi serait-ce du seul ressort de l'enseignant ? C'est tout un \u00e9tablissement qui doit innover. C'est m\u00eame l'institution en un sens. Autrement, les enseignants auraient pour mission d'innover dans un cadre traditionnel. Mais en fait ce ne sont pas les seuls enseignants qui doivent innover, c'est l'ensemble du syst\u00e8me \u00e9ducatif. Avec plus de temps, moins d'\u00e9l\u00e8ves et donc moins de copies, des enseignants pourraient \u00e0 eux tout seuls cr\u00e9er des ressources. Ou faire des hackatons p\u00e9dagogiques o\u00f9 on s'ing\u00e9nierait \u00e0 proposer des solutions nouvelles pour r\u00e9soudre des probl\u00e8mes identifi\u00e9s dans tel ou tel \u00e9tablissement. En somme, ce serait une innovation des enseignants pour les enseignants. En tout cas pas un discours publicitaire invitant \u00e0 mettre la main au porte-monnaie pour acheter de la r\u00e9alit\u00e9 virtuelle, de l'intelligence artificielle, etc. Citer Ken Robinson (r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 retrouver) 10 : Effective education is always a balance between rigor and freedom, tradition and innovation, the individual and the group, theory and practice, the inner world and the outer world. Innover pour les objectifs d'hier ? Objectifs Of the nearly 1 BILLION kids who go to school every day, more than 600 million are unable to reach minimum proficiency levels in reading and mathematics. This learning crisis is identified by the United Nations as the greatest global challenge to preparing children for life, work, and active citizenship. On ne peut innover seul. Citer Walter Isaacson 11 : Sometimes innovation involves recovering what has been lost. Dans cet ouvrage, Isaacson \u00e9voque the WELL, l'anc\u00eatre d'internet.

On ne peut l'ignorer ou balayer cette id\u00e9e d\u2019un revers de manche. Le monde change. Il est en pleine mutation. Et apr\u00e8s un Brexit, une pand\u00e9mie, une guerre en cours, une crise climatique, tout le monde en conviendra. L\u2019\u00e9cole change donc \u00e9galement ou doit changer si ce n'est pas le cas. C'est quelque chose que j'ai lu souvent. Par exemple, on dit qu'on a r\u00e9ussi la massification de l'enseignement. On dit alors qu'il faut maintenant gagner celui de la qualit\u00e9. Ou encore qu'il faut faire entrer le num\u00e9rique dans l'\u00e9cole, que l'enseignement des 3 R (writing, arithmetics, reading) ne sont plus suffisants, qu'il faut de surcro\u00eet enseigner les 4 C, etc. De fait, il faut innover. Si, par innovation, on entend la volont\u00e9 de faire progresser tous les \u00e9l\u00e8ves ou encore de faire entrer le num\u00e9rique \u00e0 l'\u00e9cole (formule un peu creuse, juste un raccourci), je vote pour. Mais les choses sont peut-\u00eatre plus compliqu\u00e9es que cela. Il faut d\u00e9finir l'innovation et comprendre les probl\u00e8mes pos\u00e9es par une telle revendication, non pas pour tout rejeter en bloc, mais pour mieux appr\u00e9hender les choses et faire des choix. Voil\u00e0 d\u00e9j\u00e0 une premi\u00e8re confusion \u00e0 corriger : l'innovation appelle au changement, mais elle n'est pas synonyme de changement. On verra pourquoi par la suite. Reste que l'injonction \u00e0 innover peut laisser perplexe. On n'innove pas pour innover. Employ\u00e9 absolument, le verbe ne veut rien dire. On veut, par exemple, innover pour am\u00e9liorer les r\u00e9sultats de ses \u00e9l\u00e8ves. On veut \u00eatre plus juste, pour lutter contre les in\u00e9galit\u00e9s par exemple.","title":"Sources"},{"location":"Documentation/Innovation/Critique%20de%20l%27innovation/#quest-ce-que-linnovation","text":"C'est assez amusant comme ce mot est \u00e0 la fois facile et difficile \u00e0 d\u00e9finir. Lorsqu'il se rapporte \u00e0 l'industrie, c'est facile. Apple est une entreprise innovante. Elle cr\u00e9e l'iPod puis l'iPhone et enfin l'iPad, et bouleverse le march\u00e9. M\u00eame chose avec Sony ou IBM qui ont, en leur temps, boulevers\u00e9 un march\u00e9 domin\u00e9 par des entreprises qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 m\u00e9chamment malmen\u00e9es par les challengers susmentionn\u00e9s. Mais, en \u00e9ducation, qu'est-ce qu'une innovation ? Il me semble qu'une exp\u00e9rience comme the hole in the wall de Sugata Mitra est une entreprise fondamentalement innovante. Donner un acc\u00e8s \u00e0 l'ordinateur \u00e0 des enfants vivant dans un bidon ville, leur en laisser un acc\u00e8s complet, sans intervention aucune de l'adulte et constater la nature \u00e9mergeante du savoir \u00e9tait extraordinaire. Mais l'enseignant comme vous et moi peut-il innover dans sa classe ? Je ne parle pas d'inverser la classe cinq \u00e0 dix ans apr\u00e8s que de r\u00e9els innovateurs l'aient mis en place pour la premi\u00e8re fois, je parle r\u00e9ellement d'innover, c'est-\u00e0-dire de faire quelque chose de nouveau dans une pratique \u00e9tablie (transmettre un savoir \u00e0 une classe d'\u00e2ge dans un lieu donn\u00e9). R\u00e9ponse ??? L\u2019innovation, c\u2019est aussi un sujet complexe et m\u00eame inqui\u00e9tant. C\u2019est un exercice int\u00e9ressant d\u2019\u00e9quilibre entre l\u2019Ancien et le Nouveau, entre h\u00e9ritage et renouvellement, entre modernit\u00e9 et tradition. Aujourd'hui, c'est un processus per\u00e7u comme extr\u00eamement positif. Alors qu'au Moyen \u00c2ge, l'innovation constituait une transgression, un bouleversement de l'ordre \u00e9tabli con\u00e7u comme immuable. Ce n'est qu'ensuite qu'il a \u00e9t\u00e9 vu comme un progr\u00e8s. D\u00e8s les Lumi\u00e8res, c'est une am\u00e9lioration des conditions de vie. C'est un levier d'\u00e9mancipation de l'homme. Miroitent les perspectives d'un bien-\u00eatre dont la publicit\u00e9 serait aujourd'hui probablement un exemple troublant : tous ces nouveaux produits qui feront de vous un individu combl\u00e9 et moderne. Mais l\u2019innovation est bien souvent l\u2019occasion d\u2019un recyclage. On fait du neuf avec du vieux comme dit Andr\u00e9 Tricot 1 . L'\u00e9tymologie, in-novare , indique que cela consiste \u00e0 introduire du nouveau dans quelque chose qui est d\u00e9j\u00e0 l\u00e0, qui pr\u00e9existe et va \u00eatre transform\u00e9. Ma culture litt\u00e9raire m'inviterait \u00e0 d\u00e9finir alors l'innovation comme une transgression de l'ancien. Il faut conna\u00eetre ses classiques pour \u00eatre moderne. C'est un peu ce que fait Baudelaire en son temps : introduire des sujets modernes (la ville par exemple) dans des po\u00e8mes de facture assez classique (le sonnet notamment). J.-C. Cailliez 2 ne dit pas autre chose, mais s'appuyant sur la musique : \u00ab Ne dit-on pas que les meilleurs jazzmans sont ceux qui connaissent leurs gammes ? Il en est de m\u00eame pour les enseignants lorsqu\u2019ils d\u00e9cident de quitter le 100% de cours magistraux pour innover \u00bb. Puisqu'on est dans le domaine des arts, cela me rappelle aussi un peu cette croyance du Grand Si\u00e8cle, qu'on arrive trop tard, que tout a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait, que les Anciens ont tout dit. Ils ne nous laissent que la possibilit\u00e9 de les imiter, dit La Fontaine. Et en un sens, tout a d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 fait en mati\u00e8re d'\u00e9ducation. En termes de p\u00e9dagogie, il va \u00eatre tr\u00e8s difficile d'innover (s'appuyer sur Tricot) Emmanuel Davidenkoff nous le rappelle dans Le Tsunami num\u00e9rique 4 : H\u00e9rodote et \u00c9rasme pratiquaient la learning expedition\u2008; un directeur de conscience n\u2019a pas grand-chose \u00e0 envier \u00e0 un coach\u2008; le serio ludere du Quattrocento italien pr\u00e9figure les serious games du XXI e si\u00e8cle\u2008; C\u00e9lestin Freinet n\u2019avait pas besoin de Twitter pour faire correspondre les \u00e9l\u00e8ves\u2008; la flipped classroom (classe invers\u00e9e) avec son \u00ab professeur-pr\u00e9cepteur\u2008\u00bb n\u2019est pas tr\u00e8s \u00e9loign\u00e9e du fonctionnement du lyc\u00e9e du XIX e si\u00e8cle Mais ce qui est vrai pour le domaine p\u00e9dagogique est-il vrai pour tout ce qui a trait \u00e0 l'\u00e9ducation. Non, bien s\u00fbr. Pour diverses raisons. Celle qui me tient \u00e0 c\u0153ur est certainement celle des si mal nomm\u00e9s \u00ab outils num\u00e9riques \u00bb qui ne peuvent ainsi d\u00e9sign\u00e9s qu'en tant qu'ils permettent de faire peut \u00eatre mieux mais faire ce qu'on faisait d\u00e9j\u00e0 avant. Or le \u00ab num\u00e9rique \u00bb nous impose de faire de nouvelles choses. Il permet de faire des choses qu'on ne faisait pas avant. La n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 d'enseigner les 4C le montre bien (\u00e0 d\u00e9velopper). Il y a aussi cette id\u00e9e qu'on n'innove pas tout seul. C'est la raison pour laquelle il faut apprendre \u00e0 travailler ensemble (voir les 4C encore). Les grandes innovations sont le produit d'\u00e9quipe. Internet en est un bel exemple. Mais l'innovation, c\u2019est aussi un mod\u00e8le port\u00e9 par l\u2019industrie (la Silicon Valley notamment) qui d\u00e9clare le pass\u00e9 comme obsol\u00e8te voire cass\u00e9 et le futur charg\u00e9 de promesses (\u00ab Think different \u00bb ,\u00ab Make the world a better a place \u00bb...). En fait, impossible de s\u00e9parer innovation et \u00e9conomie. Dans son livre Creating Innovators 3 , Tony Wagner \u00e9voque dans sa pr\u00e9face la crise de 2008 et ses cons\u00e9quences sur l'\u00e9conomie. C'est la sant\u00e9 de l'\u00e9conomie qui doit g\u00e9n\u00e9rer l'innovation : The long-term health of our economy and a full economic recovery are dependent upon creating far more innovation. New or improved ideas, products, and services create wealth and new jobs. Ce qui n'est pas compl\u00e8tement scandaleux. Apr\u00e8s tout, l'\u00e9ducation n'a pas pour unique but de vous sensibiliser aux subtilit\u00e9s des r\u00e8gles de la versification au XVI e si\u00e8cle, mais aussi \u00e9ventuellement de vous donner un travail. Toutefois, Wagner ajoute : Most leaders agree on one thing, however. The long-term health of our economy and a full economic recovery are dependent upon creating far more innovation. New or improved ideas, products, and services create wealth and new jobs. Business leaders, in particular, say that we need many more young people who can create innovations in the areas of science, technology, and engineering. En fait, on a ici un programme \u00e9ducatif dont l'objectif est de soigner l'\u00e9conomie. \u00c9videmment, cela forme un cycle, puisqu'en retour, l'\u00e9conomie nourrit ceux qui participent \u00e0 son d\u00e9veloppement. L'urgence est d'autant \u00e9vidente que la menace de l'automatisation est une invitation \u00e0 rendre les gens plus comp\u00e9tents dans les domaines de la technologie afin qu'ils puissent faire ce que les machines ne sont pas en mesure de faire. En somme, pourquoi pas ? Malheureusement, la comp\u00e9tition \u00e9conomique est souvent l'envers d'un discours nationaliste. Cf. Obama : In America, innovation doesn\u2019t just change our lives. It\u2019s how we make a living. We need to out-innovate, out-educate and out-build the rest of the world.\u201d (https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/State_of_the_Union/state-of-the-union-2011-full-transcript/story?id=12759395) Pourquoi innove-t-on ? Le fait que l'innovation a pour but de trouver des solutions aux probl\u00e8mes d'aujourd'hui. Peut-on enseigner l'innovation ? La cr\u00e9ativit\u00e9 ? Et dans quelle mati\u00e8re ? En lisant Wagner, on voit bien que l'innovation n'existerait essentiellement que dans les sciences, la technologie, les maths, l'ing\u00e9nierie. Toutefois, l\u2019innovation ne peut vendre du neuf que sur une courte p\u00e9riode de temps. Le neuf ne dure pas. Il peut m\u00eame devenir tradition. Et la tradition devenir innovation. Voir plus haut (ou plus bas ?). Ce processus de renouvellement \u00e9voque un cycle naturel : ascension/chute, croissance/d\u00e9cadence, floraison/fl\u00e9trissure\u2026 Il faut alors renouveler en permanence. C\u2019est en fait un processus \u00e9conomique (la fameuse cr\u00e9ation destructrice de Schumpeter, le renouvellement permanent d\u00e9truisant l\u2019ancien). Il repose sur une peur de l\u2019effondrement financier et de la fin du capitalisme. Et je suis frapp\u00e9 en lisant George Couros 5 , Davidenkoff, Christensen, etc. de constater que tous \u00e9voquent un commerce (Kodak, Blockbuster) qui n\u2019a pas su percevoir les changements et ont provoqu\u00e9 leur effondrement. Crainte d\u2019une \u00e9cole qui subirait le m\u00eame sort. L\u2019innovation \u00ab disruptive \u00bb a donc pour but de d\u00e9truire le vieux pour faire du neuf. C\u2019est le discours marketing que vous connaissez bien (la fin du monde tel qu\u2019on le connait, Rien ne sera plus comme avant\u2026). Vous l'avez entendu \u00e0 chaque pr\u00e9sentation, chaque keynote, chaque d\u00e9claration de CEO de la Silicon Valley. Tout doit \u00eatre \u00ab perturb\u00e9 \u00bb : l\u2019\u00e9cole, la sant\u00e9, l\u2019urbanisme\u2026 Jamais assez nouveau : NASA's new innovation could help get humans to Mars by 2040 | Mashable (\"new innovatio\") Pour plagier Jill Lepore 6 , le 18 e si\u00e8cle a adopt\u00e9 l'id\u00e9e de progr\u00e8s, le 19 e si\u00e8cle a connu l'\u00e9volution, le 20 e la croissance puis l'innovation. Notre \u00e9poque conna\u00eet la \u00ab disruption \u00bb. Pas de bol. Il ne s'agit plus seulement d'innover. En fait, l'innovation n'est plus assez. C'est la voracit\u00e9 capitaliste, mais voyons les choses du bon c\u00f4t\u00e9. C\u2019est aussi une tension qui semble s\u00e9duire, qui stimule la r\u00e9flexion et qui semble vieille comme le monde : ancien et nouveau testament, querelle des anciens et des modernes, digital natives vs boomers\u2026 Je trouve cette tension entre tradition, h\u00e9ritage et modernit\u00e9, adaptation, transformation assez fascinante. En somme, on est toujours sur le fil du choix \u00e0 faire, dans un monde en p\u00e9ril ou changeant en permanence. Profitons-en pour rappeler un truisme. Le changement est l\u2019ordre du monde. C\u2019est l\u2019id\u00e9e de permanence qui est illusoire. Merci H\u00e9raclite. En somme, on n'a pas le choix. C'est ce que nous rappelle Fran\u00e7oise Cros et Dominique Broussal dans Changement et innovation en \u00e9ducation : deux notions en r\u00e9sonance 7 . [L\u2019innovation a aussi une implication religieuse : sauver le monde, r\u00e9demption \u00e9conomique et annonce de lendemains meilleurs. ] \u00c9voquer aussi Ken Robinson in Out of our minds (innovation comme imp\u00e9ratif humain) : Biologically, we are probably evolving at the same rate as other species: in cultural terms, we have always evolved at a uniquely furious rate. So far as we can tell, the cultural lives of dogs and cats are not changing that much. Left to their own devices, they seem to be doing what they have always done and to be pre-occupied with the same sorts of things. There is no need to keep checking in with them to see what\u2019s new. In human life, there is always something new, because creativity is part of what it is to be human. L\u2019innovation exerce sa fascination, disais-je. Mais c'est une fascination l\u00e9gitime. Il y a un d\u00e9fi \u00e0 innover, \u00e0 bouleverser les pratiques, \u00e0 chercher \u00ab l'or du temps \u00bb, \u00e0 \u00ab \u00eatre absolument moderne \u00bb, \u00e0 \u00e9pouser les transformations du monde, \u00e0 ne pas sombrer dans un pass\u00e9isme idol\u00e2tre, \u00e0 ne pas s'effrayer de la nouveaut\u00e9, mais aussi \u00e0 ne pas s'en laisser compter par les sir\u00e8nes de l'industrie et du marketing. Mais cela est-il possible ? Peut-on \u00ab disrupter \u00bb l'\u00e9ducation comme on perturbe le domaine de la sant\u00e9 ou de la t\u00e9l\u00e9phonie ? Un Justin Reich r\u00e9pondrait que non, que la technologie ne domestique pas l'\u00e9ducation mais que c'est le contraire. Notez que Diana Laurillard 8 dit non \u00e9galement. Transformer l'industrie, le syst\u00e8me bancaire en un sens est ais\u00e9. Transformer la fa\u00e7on on apprend et on enseigne est une toute autre affaire. People are fond of pointing out that the nineteenth-century time traveller would be astonished by our banks, factories, and operating theatres \u2013 all transformed by new technology \u2013 while the classroom has hardly changed. However, bankers, industrialists, and surgeons have had huge resources devoted to developing the specialised systems they need for transformation. Teachers have not. Yet it is a much more tractable problem to model the activity that moves a credit from one account to another than to model the activity that moves a mind from confusion to understanding. Governments provide education with the tools developed for industry and commerce, but who is there to help teachers and lecturers work out how to use them to transform teaching and learning? Pourtant beaucoup souhaitent bouleverser le syst\u00e8me \u00e9ducatif. J'en ai encore trouv\u00e9 un exemple sur Twitter tr\u00e8s r\u00e9cemment. Cf capture d'\u00e9cran (r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 retrouver) Reflect on a major disruptor that you have witnessed during your life (e.g., Uber, iPhone, Netflix, TikTok, Airbnb, etc.). What lessons can be applied to spark needed changes to education? https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5eb9b365d2446e64333aec15/t/60ed91aef67381323ef96b2a/1626182062517/Disruptive+Study+Guide.pdf L'id\u00e9e est que si Uber a \u00ab disrupt\u00e9 \u00bb l'\u00e9conomie, il doit bien se trouver une entreprise quelque part pour modifier en profondeur l'\u00e9ducation. Et de fait, permettre \u00e0 ceux qui le feront de gagner des sommes colossales. C'est ce qu'on annonce depuis des ann\u00e9es. 2009 en fait avec Disruptive class de Clayton Christensen. Je ne sais pas si c'est utile d'expliquer pourquoi une uberisation de l'\u00e9ducation serait malvenue. On peut toutefois l\u00e9gitimement se demander en quoi la volont\u00e9 disruptive mentionn\u00e9e pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment est si mauvaise. Apr\u00e8s tout, on parle de changement, de croissance, etc. (vocabulaire de l'entreprise). Pas bien ? Le fait est que toutes les annonces de disruption se sont toutes sold\u00e9es par un \u00e9chec. \u00c9voquer Clayton Christensen (citation de Reich 9 ) In 2008, Harvard Business School professor Clayton Christensen, with colleagues Michael Horn and Curtis Johnson, published Disrupting Class, a book about online learning and the future of K\u201312 schools. They predicted that by 2019, half of all middle- and high-school courses would be replaced by online options, and \u201cthe cost will be one-third of today\u2019s costs, and the courses will be much better.\u201dThese dramatic changes would be driven by innovators in education technology, or edtech. La \u00ab disruption \u00bb du syst\u00e8me scolaire ne peut \u00eatre qu'incr\u00e9mentale. C'est un changement progressif, lent. Et surtout au c\u0153ur de forces contradictoires. Citation de Reich. Schools are complex systems, and many stakeholders in school systems\u2014teachers, students, parents, administrators, and policymakers\u2014are often quite committed to various aspects of the status quo. The schools that exist today are an assemblage of features designed to balance competing visions of the purpose of schooling: inspiring lifelong learning, helping learners pass through gatekeeping exams, preparing people for their lives as citizens. As a result of these varied purposes, schools are tasked with an almost inconceivable array of often competing functions [...] Mais l'innovation peut-elle se d\u00e9cr\u00e9ter ? Peut-elle \u00eatre minist\u00e9rielle ? Institutionnalis\u00e9e ? Non, si on entend normaliser la cr\u00e9ativit\u00e9 des enseignants et les pousser \u00e0 un renouvellement permanent. Ce serait un peu comme avec l'imp\u00e9ratif du verbe \u00ab pouvoir \u00bb. Il n'existe pas. Oui, si l'on veut que le pouvoir politique agisse avec force, mais \u00e0 condition que l'injonction \u00e0 innover ne soit pas du seul ressort des enseignants. Et il s'agit plus d'une invitation, mindset (cf Couros), non pas tout changer mais accompagner enseignants d'un point a \u00e0 un point b. Innover serait alors pour l'\u00c9ducation nationale de mieux payer ses enseignants, de mettre fin \u00e0 la crise du recrutement, etc. Si j'\u00e9tais ministre, mon innovation \u00e0 moi serait de permettre aux enseignants de cr\u00e9er du contenu libre par exemple. Ou encore de revoir l'architecture des classes qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 pens\u00e9 pour les si\u00e8cles pass\u00e9s et dans lesquelles malheureusement l'air est irrespirable en ces p\u00e9riodes de chaleur. Pourquoi serait-ce du seul ressort de l'enseignant ? C'est tout un \u00e9tablissement qui doit innover. C'est m\u00eame l'institution en un sens. Autrement, les enseignants auraient pour mission d'innover dans un cadre traditionnel. Mais en fait ce ne sont pas les seuls enseignants qui doivent innover, c'est l'ensemble du syst\u00e8me \u00e9ducatif. Avec plus de temps, moins d'\u00e9l\u00e8ves et donc moins de copies, des enseignants pourraient \u00e0 eux tout seuls cr\u00e9er des ressources. Ou faire des hackatons p\u00e9dagogiques o\u00f9 on s'ing\u00e9nierait \u00e0 proposer des solutions nouvelles pour r\u00e9soudre des probl\u00e8mes identifi\u00e9s dans tel ou tel \u00e9tablissement. En somme, ce serait une innovation des enseignants pour les enseignants. En tout cas pas un discours publicitaire invitant \u00e0 mettre la main au porte-monnaie pour acheter de la r\u00e9alit\u00e9 virtuelle, de l'intelligence artificielle, etc. Citer Ken Robinson (r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 retrouver) 10 : Effective education is always a balance between rigor and freedom, tradition and innovation, the individual and the group, theory and practice, the inner world and the outer world. Innover pour les objectifs d'hier ? Objectifs Of the nearly 1 BILLION kids who go to school every day, more than 600 million are unable to reach minimum proficiency levels in reading and mathematics. This learning crisis is identified by the United Nations as the greatest global challenge to preparing children for life, work, and active citizenship. On ne peut innover seul.

Schools and colleges are among the most durable and conservative of our social institutions. They prepare people for the future by connecting them with knowledge and wisdom from the past. Faculty make some accommodations for changing times, but for the most part, instructors teach how they were taught. Schools hold fast. Failure to disrupt , Introduction, Justin Reich Tension entre l'ancien et le nouveau. Lu dans Teaching Machines: A Brief History of \"Teaching at Scale\" (2014) : Yesterday was one of those regularly scheduled moments when the technology industry puts that best on display: an Apple keynote, where new products are introduced that have everyone cooing about innovation, that have everyone prepared to declare last year\u2019s hardware and software obsolete, and often have education technology writers predicting that this is going to revolutionize the way we teach and learn. (Audrey Watters) \u279d L'industrie suscite ce discours admiratif devant un renouvellement permanent. Toute nouveaut\u00e9 technologique est porteuse d'une part non n\u00e9gligeable de tradition qui, dans le cas des MOOCs, peut expliquer son \u00e9chec (\" ideology is embedded in technology\" Audrey Watters. Article cit\u00e9 \ud83d\udc46) Educators and researchers who had been conducting online courses since the 1980s noted that few new MOOCs offered an improved pedagogical experience for distance learners; most courses simply recorded a professor lecturing, harkening back to the earliest days of motion pictures when the first order of business was the filming of stage plays. Failure to disrupt , Instructor-guided learning at scale, Massive Open Online Courses, Justin Reich \u279d Voir plus chapitre New Technologies, Old Pedagogies (\u00e9chec des MOOCs s'explique pour cette raison) Nombreux sont ceux qui affirment que telle ou telle technologie va transformer l'\u00e9cole. In 2008, Harvard Business School professor Clayton Christensen, with colleagues Michael Horn and Curtis Johnson, published Disrupting Class , a book about online learning and the future of K\u201312 schools. They predicted that by 2019, half of all middle- and high-school courses would be replaced by online options, and \u201cthe cost will be one-third of today\u2019s costs, and the courses will be much better.\u201d These dramatic changes would be driven by innovators in education technology, or edtech . One such educator (though he was not identified by name in Disrupting Class), was Salman Khan, who in 2008 founded Khan Academy [...].

On annoncait la fermeture des universit\u00e9s : In early 2013, Clayton Christensen [...] warned that within fifteen years, \u201cmaybe half the universities would be in bankruptcy.\u201d The concern was that every local college\u2019s Introduction to Biology course would be replaced by one or two Bio 101 courses taught by rockstar super-professors from elite universities. Cf. the \"iron triangle\" of cost , access and quality qui \u00e9tait cens\u00e9 transformer le syst\u00e8me universitaire. Cela me rappelle (EDIT : en fait, ce passage est cit\u00e9 au tout d\u00e9but de la conclusion) : Savez-vous qui a dit : \u00ab Les livres seront bient\u00f4t obsol\u00e8tes dans les \u00e9coles. Les \u00e9l\u00e8ves recevront un enseignement visuel. Il est possible d\u2019enseigner tous les domaines de la connaissance humaine par le cin\u00e9ma. Notre syst\u00e8me scolaire va compl\u00e8tement changer d\u2019ici dix ans . Nous travaillons depuis un certain temps sur les films scolaires. Nous avons \u00e9tudi\u00e9 et reproduit la vie de la mouche, du moustique, du ver \u00e0 soie, de la mite brune, des papillons et d\u2019autres insectes, ainsi que la cristallisation chimique. Nos travaux montrent de fa\u00e7on concluante la valeur des films dans l\u2019enseignement de la chimie, de la physique et d\u2019autres domaines, ce qui rend les connaissances scientifiques, difficiles \u00e0 comprendre dans les livres, claires et simples pour les enfants. \u00bb ? C\u2019est Thomas Edison, en 1913, dans une interview au New York Dramatic Mirror . Il r\u00e9pondait \u00e0 la question \u00ab Quel est votre avis sur la valeur p\u00e9dagogique du cin\u00e9ma ? \u00bb Cette citation donne le vertige : et si le num\u00e9rique nous refaisait le coup du cin\u00e9ma ? Quand Thomas Edison disait cela, il \u00e9tait parfaitement honn\u00eate et raisonnable. Il n\u2019imaginait peut-\u00eatre pas \u00e0 quel point le cin\u00e9ma allait bouleverser le xxe si\u00e8cle, notre rapport \u00e0 la culture, il n\u2019imaginait peut-\u00eatre pas qu\u2019un art majeur \u00e9tait en train de na\u00eetre. Mais il n\u2019imaginait pas non plus que le cin\u00e9ma allait rester en dehors des salles de classe. La valeur p\u00e9dagogique potentielle du cin\u00e9ma est sans doute immense. Sa valeur p\u00e9dagogique r\u00e9elle est tr\u00e8s limit\u00e9e. Apprendre avec le num\u00e9rique, Mythes et r\u00e9alit\u00e9s , Franck Amadieu et Andr\u00e9 Tricot \u279d Books Will Soon Be Obsolete in the Schools : \u201cBooks,\u201d declared the inventor with decision, \u201cwill soon be obsolete in the public schools. Scholars will be instructed through the eye. It is possible to teach every branch of human knowledge with the motion picture. Our school system will be completely changed inside of ten years. \u201cWe have been working for some time on the school pictures. We have been studying and reproducing the life of the fly, mosquito, silk weaving moth, brown moth, gypsy moth, butterflies, scale and various other insects, as well as chemical chrystallization. It proves conclusively the worth of motion pictures in chemistry, physics and other branches of study, making the scientific truths, difficult to understand from text books, plain and clear to children. Edward L. Thorndike and John Dewey \u29eb Edward L. Thorndike won and John Dewey lost. This lecture-based pedagogical approach goes back millennia. To a first approximation, there are only two primary approaches to teaching and learning . As Plutarch wrote in \u201cOn Listening\u201d in the first century CE, \u201cEducation is not the filling of a pail, but the lighting of a fire.\u201d Of course, theories of learning and instruction can be infinitely more complex than this simple dichotomy, but these two perspectives of pail filling and fire lighting appear in various guises throughout the history of schooling and learning. Summarizing these two ideas in the American context, historian Ellen Lagemann argued, \u201cOne cannot understand the history of education in the United States during the twentieth century, unless one realizes that Edward L. Thorndike won and John Dewey lost.\u201d In twentieth-century America, philosopher John Dewey became the patron saint of the fire-lighters.

Thorndike believed that education could be organized as a science, in the positivist traditions that shaped sociology, political science, economics, and other social sciences. Thorndike believed that learning could be precisely measured, and he was an early developer and advocate of standardized tests and intelligence testing. With these measures of learning, best practices in the direct transfer from experts to novices could be standardized and scientifically evaluated. No single term captures all of the pail-filling intellectual decedents of Thorndike\u2019s thinking, but instructionism is a useful label for these ideas. MOOC developers have been overwhelmingly instructionists. New learning technologies rarely innovate on these fundamental pedagogical ideas. Instead, they reenact them.

Article cit\u00e9 \ud83d\udc46) Educators and researchers who had been conducting online courses since the 1980s noted that few new MOOCs offered an improved pedagogical experience for distance learners; most courses simply recorded a professor lecturing, harkening back to the earliest days of motion pictures when the first order of business was the filming of stage plays.

Thorndike won and John Dewey lost. This lecture-based pedagogical approach goes back millennia. To a first approximation, there are only two primary approaches to teaching and learning . As Plutarch wrote in \u201cOn Listening\u201d in the first century CE, \u201cEducation is not the filling of a pail, but the lighting of a fire.\u201d Of course, theories of learning and instruction can be infinitely more complex than this simple dichotomy, but these two perspectives of pail filling and fire lighting appear in various guises throughout the history of schooling and learning. Summarizing these two ideas in the American context, historian Ellen Lagemann argued, \u201cOne cannot understand the history of education in the United States during the twentieth century, unless one realizes that Edward L. Thorndike won and John Dewey lost.\u201d In twentieth-century America, philosopher John Dewey became the patron saint of the fire-lighters.

It\u2019s about the process by which . . . new things take place. I look at innovation as an approach. However, [the institute] uses the standard definition, which is about novel and creative ways to create value through new products and services, or new business models or new processes .\u201d \u201cInnovation may then be defined as the process of having original ideas and insights that have value, and then implementing them so that they are accepted and used by significant numbers of people. By this definition, a major innovation is one that is so successful that soon after its introduction few people can even remember what life was like before the innovation was introduced.\u201d Ellen Bowman [\u2026] told me in a recent interview that her definition of innovation is simply \u201ccreative problem solving.\u201d She said, \u201cProblem solving without the creative element is not truly innovative.\u201d And creativity that is not applied to real world problems cannot be considered innovation either. Innovation is our lifeblood at P&G\u2014but not just innovation for its own sake. It\u2019s about taking real needs and creating a bridge to a solution.\u201d On voit combien ces d\u00e9finitions sont li\u00e9es \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9conomie. L\u2019importance de la sant\u00e9 \u00e9conomique est d\u00e9velopp\u00e9e d\u00e8s le d\u00e9but du livre : The long-term health of our economy and a full economic recovery are dependent upon creating far more innovation. New or improved ideas, products, and services create wealth and new jobs. D\u00e9finition in The Innovator\u2019s Mindset \u29eb Et si on lit The Innovator\u2019s Mindset de George Couros, m\u00eame chose d\u00e8s le d\u00e9but, comparaison avec l\u2019\u00e9conomie : If education\u2019s leaders refuse to evaluate and stay in touch with students\u2019 needs, our institutions will fail, just like businesses that don\u2019t keep up with changing customers\u2019 needs. Et plus loin : The structure and type of learning that happens in many of our schools does not fulfill the needs of the twenty-first-century marketplace. When students graduate, many of them are good at one thing: school. La d\u00e9finition que Couros donne est celle-ci : For the purpose of this book, I\u2019m defining innovation as a way of thinking that creates something new and better . Innovation can come from either \u201cinvention\u201d (something totally new) or \u201citeration\u201d (a change of something that already exists), but if it does not meet the idea of \u201cnew and better,\u201d it is not innovative. That means that change for the sake of change is never good enough. Il ajoute ces propos de Carl Bass CEO of Autodesk (TEDx talk) : \u201cThe New Rules of Innovation,\u201d \u201cInnovation is the process by which we change the world.... It\u2019s the practical application of ideas and technologies to make new and better things. \u201d Il fait \u00e9galement un parall\u00e8le avec la transformation : Another word that is often used interchangeably with innovation is transformation, which is really more about dramatically altering the work educators do. [\u2026] the truth is innovation\u2014in our thinking as individuals and organizations\u2014is within easy reach; no dramatic shifts required . L\u2019id\u00e9e de transformation rejoint un peu celles de Justin Reich (la technologie ne \u00ab disrupte \u00bb pas l\u2019\u00e9ducation. R\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 retrouver). D\u00e9finition de Ken Robinson \u29eb Cr\u00e9ativit\u00e9 et Innovation \u29eb Comme on a d\u00e9j\u00e0 pu le voir ci-dessus, innovation et cr\u00e9ativit\u00e9 sont li\u00e9s. \"Imagination is the root of creativity. It is the ability to bring to mind things that aren\u2019t present to our senses. Creativity is putting your imagination to work. It is applied imagination. Innovation is putting new ideas into practice.\" (Ken Robinson and Lou Aronica, Creative Schools ) Ken Robinson dans Out of your mind \u00e9crit They are imagination , which is the process of bringing to mind things that are not present to our senses; creativity , which is the process of developing original ideas that have value, and innovation , which is the process of putting new ideas into practice. Il ajoute plus loin Creativity involves putting your imagination to work. In a sense, creativity is applied imagination. Innovation is the process of putting new ideas into practice. Innovation is applied creativity. By definition, innovation is always about introducing something new, or improved, or both and it is usually assumed to be a positive thing. Processus : imagination > cr\u00e9ativit\u00e9 > innovation. Retenons \u00e9galement l'id\u00e9e du b\u00e9n\u00e9fice : l'innovation est positive . Incremental vs Disruptive Innovation \u29eb Tony Wagner oppose Incremental Innovation et Disruptive Innovation : Incremental innovation is about significantly improving existing products, processes, or services. Disruptive or transformative innovation, on the other hand, is about creating a new or fundamentally different product or service that disrupts existing markets and displaces formerly dominant technologies. Creating Innovators: The Making of Young People Who Will Change the World (chapitre 1) Influence de Clayton Christensen, The Innovator's Dilemma (\u00e0 rapprocher de ce qu\u2019\u00e9crivent Audrey Watters et Justin Reich dans Failure to disrupt ). Id\u00e9e int\u00e9ressante. L'innovation n'est pas n\u00e9cessairement bouleversement complet. And that\u2019s a key lesson: innovation is not about changing everything; sometimes you only need to change one thing. That experience can lead to new and better learning opportunities. (George Courros , ajouter citation que j'ai mise dans pr\u00e9sentation, donner r\u00e9f exacte) \u00c0 quel moment l\u2019innovation surgit-elle ? \u29eb Selon Clive Thompson, \u201cMost huge innovations emerge gradually, not suddenly\u201d (source : The \u2018Long Nose\u2019 Theory of Tech Innovation ) As Buxton\u2019s argument goes, very few major technologies emerge suddenly . Quite the opposite: They\u2019re usually the product of gradual tinkering and experimentation, with engineers and designers puttering around for years or even decades. Things get slowly refined, and the new tech starts being used in real-world circumstances, but mostly in niche areas. Eventually some mass-market inventor notices these niche uses and realizes huh, this tech really works now. They build it into a mainstream product \u2014 which bursts into truly mass adoption. C\u2019est la th\u00e9orie du \u00ab long nez \u00bb : Buxton calls this the \u201clong nose,\u201d based on a chart he drew, below. The X-axis is time; the Y-axis is adoption. During the long period when the technology is being refined, it\u2019s not very widespread. Then suddenly it bursts into mass adoption. Lire la suite de l\u2019article pour comprendre le concept de \u201csurprising obviousness\u201d. Du fait que certaines technologies ont \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9j\u00e0 utilis\u00e9es longtemps auparavant, lorsqu\u2019elles deviennent massivement r\u00e9pandues, elles ont cette surprenante \u00e9vidence qui caract\u00e9rise l\u2019innovation. Conclusion : If you wanted to predict the Next Big Thing, the Long Nose theory suggests that you don\u2019t need to look in top-secret corporate innovation labs or in the latest scientific literature. No, you look in the world around you.

Pourtant, lorsqu\u2019il s\u2019agit d\u2019introduire en classe l\u2019utilisation par les \u00e9l\u00e8ves d\u2019un smartphone jusque-l\u00e0 jamais introduit, le nouveau est bien dans cette introduction ! Peut-on pour autant d\u00e9clarer qu\u2019il s\u2019agit d\u2019une innovation en \u00e9ducation si le ma\u00eetre emploie le smartphone comme il l\u2019aurait fait avec un manuel ? La difficult\u00e9 vient du fait que l\u2019\u00e9cole et surtout les apprentissages sont \u00e9troitement li\u00e9s aux pratiques p\u00e9dagogiques, \u00e0 des processus sociaux, \u00e0 de l\u2019intersubjectivit\u00e9. C\u2019est au c\u0153ur de cette relation qu\u2019intervient l\u2019innovation : l\u2019objet nouveau intrins\u00e8quement ne peut qualifier \u00e0 lui seul l\u2019innovation de nouvelle. C\u2019est dans la relation p\u00e9dagogique que s\u2019observe la nouveaut\u00e9, dans cette relation qui s\u2019approprie l\u2019objet nouveau pour d\u00e9velopper une qualit\u00e9 ma\u00eetre-apprenants plus en ad\u00e9quation avec les profils des form\u00e9s. O\u00f9 se trouve alors la nouveaut\u00e9 dans l\u2019\u00e9ducation quand on sait que tout a \u00e9t\u00e9 tent\u00e9 en mati\u00e8re de nouveaut\u00e9 de cette relation p\u00e9dagogique ? Il suffit de consulter les grands p\u00e9dagogues depuis Platon jusqu\u2019\u00e0 nos jours pour constater que pratiquement toutes les modalit\u00e9s d\u2019apprentissage ont \u00e9t\u00e9 exploit\u00e9es ! La nouveaut\u00e9 r\u00e9side alors dans le contexte de cette relation qui n\u2019est plus le m\u00eame, ce contexte pouvant occasionner une nouvelle pratique d\u2019enseignants, pratique que ces derniers n\u2019avaient jusque-l\u00e0 pas r\u00e9alis\u00e9e, ne serait-ce que dans les modalit\u00e9s d\u2019usages de cet objet nouveau. L\u2019apparition de la nouveaut\u00e9 recouvre un empan large : de la plus modeste modification (comme de changer de manuel) \u00e0 la plus impliquante (comme changer de pratique professionnelle). Elle convoque conjointement trois capacit\u00e9s : d\u2019une part, une expertise du domaine concern\u00e9 (par exemple, les nouveaux enseignants, contrairement \u00e0 ce qu\u2019on pourrait penser, innovent peu (Huberman, 1991)), d\u2019autre part, de la motivation et, enfin, une pens\u00e9e cr\u00e9ative ou, du moins transgressive, [...] Qui dit pens\u00e9e cr\u00e9ative ne d\u00e9signe pas une aptitude \u00e0 la cr\u00e9ation, beaucoup plus ample et ambitieuse, mais une capacit\u00e9 poss\u00e9d\u00e9e par tous, qui peut, certes, \u00eatre d\u00e9velopp\u00e9e lors d\u2019activit\u00e9s formatives, mais dont tout individu est dot\u00e9. Anzieu (1981), distingue cr\u00e9ativit\u00e9 et cr\u00e9ation quand il \u00e9crit : \u00ab Les arts mineurs comme la d\u00e9coration, la gastronomie, le tissage, la poterie etc. sollicitent la cr\u00e9ativit\u00e9\u2026 C\u2019est un domaine dans lequel on ne consid\u00e8re pas qu\u2019il y ait cr\u00e9ation. Alors on parle d\u2019innovation au lieu de cr\u00e9ation \u00bb (p.59). La cr\u00e9ativit\u00e9 est indispensable pour innover ; pour autant, elle n\u2019est pas suffisante. Elle est accompagn\u00e9e d\u2019une volont\u00e9 de changement (souvent faite de valeurs \u00e0 d\u00e9fendre) et d\u2019une connaissance du lieu o\u00f9 se d\u00e9veloppe cette innovation, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire en \u00e9ducation d\u2019une certaine expertise dans le domaine. C\u2019est \u00e0 travers une r\u00e9organisation singuli\u00e8re de ces ingr\u00e9dients en lien avec les \u00e9l\u00e9ments contextuels que se met en place l\u2019innovation.

It\u2019s about the process by which . . . new things take place. I look at innovation as an approach. However, [the institute] uses the standard definition, which is about novel and creative ways to create value through new products and services, or new business models or new processes .\u201d \u201cInnovation may then be defined as the process of having original ideas and insights that have value, and then implementing them so that they are accepted and used by significant numbers of people. By this definition, a major innovation is one that is so successful that soon after its introduction few people can even remember what life was like before the innovation was introduced.\u201d Ellen Bowman [\u2026] told me in a recent interview that her definition of innovation is simply \u201ccreative problem solving.\u201d She said, \u201cProblem solving without the creative element is not truly innovative.\u201d And creativity that is not applied to real world problems cannot be considered innovation either.

Innovation can come from either \u201cinvention\u201d (something totally new) or \u201citeration\u201d (a change of something that already exists), but if it does not meet the idea of \u201cnew and better,\u201d it is not innovative.

Things get slowly refined, and the new tech starts being used in real-world circumstances, but mostly in niche areas.

C\u2019est au c\u0153ur de cette relation qu\u2019intervient l\u2019innovation : l\u2019objet nouveau intrins\u00e8quement ne peut qualifier \u00e0 lui seul l\u2019innovation de nouvelle. C\u2019est dans la relation p\u00e9dagogique que s\u2019observe la nouveaut\u00e9, dans cette relation qui s\u2019approprie l\u2019objet nouveau pour d\u00e9velopper une qualit\u00e9 ma\u00eetre-apprenants plus en ad\u00e9quation avec les profils des form\u00e9s. O\u00f9 se trouve alors la nouveaut\u00e9 dans l\u2019\u00e9ducation quand on sait que tout a \u00e9t\u00e9 tent\u00e9 en mati\u00e8re de nouveaut\u00e9 de cette relation p\u00e9dagogique ? Il suffit de consulter les grands p\u00e9dagogues depuis Platon jusqu\u2019\u00e0 nos jours pour constater que pratiquement toutes les modalit\u00e9s d\u2019apprentissage ont \u00e9t\u00e9 exploit\u00e9es ! La nouveaut\u00e9 r\u00e9side alors dans le contexte de cette relation qui n\u2019est plus le m\u00eame, ce contexte pouvant occasionner une nouvelle pratique d\u2019enseignants, pratique que ces derniers n\u2019avaient jusque-l\u00e0 pas r\u00e9alis\u00e9e, ne serait-ce que dans les modalit\u00e9s d\u2019usages de cet objet nouveau. L\u2019apparition de la nouveaut\u00e9 recouvre un empan large : de la plus modeste modification (comme de changer de manuel) \u00e0 la plus impliquante (comme changer de pratique professionnelle). Elle convoque conjointement trois capacit\u00e9s : d\u2019une part, une expertise du domaine concern\u00e9 (par exemple, les nouveaux enseignants, contrairement \u00e0 ce qu\u2019on pourrait penser, innovent peu (Huberman, 1991)), d\u2019autre part, de la motivation et, enfin, une pens\u00e9e cr\u00e9ative ou, du moins transgressive, [...] Qui dit pens\u00e9e cr\u00e9ative ne d\u00e9signe pas une aptitude \u00e0 la cr\u00e9ation, beaucoup plus ample et ambitieuse, mais une capacit\u00e9 poss\u00e9d\u00e9e par tous, qui peut, certes, \u00eatre d\u00e9velopp\u00e9e lors d\u2019activit\u00e9s formatives, mais dont tout individu est dot\u00e9. Anzieu (1981), distingue cr\u00e9ativit\u00e9 et cr\u00e9ation quand il \u00e9crit : \u00ab Les arts mineurs comme la d\u00e9coration, la gastronomie, le tissage, la poterie etc. sollicitent la cr\u00e9ativit\u00e9\u2026 C\u2019est un domaine dans lequel on ne consid\u00e8re pas qu\u2019il y ait cr\u00e9ation. Alors on parle d\u2019innovation au lieu de cr\u00e9ation \u00bb (p.59). La cr\u00e9ativit\u00e9 est indispensable pour innover ; pour autant, elle n\u2019est pas suffisante. Elle est accompagn\u00e9e d\u2019une volont\u00e9 de changement (souvent faite de valeurs \u00e0 d\u00e9fendre) et d\u2019une connaissance du lieu o\u00f9 se d\u00e9veloppe cette innovation, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire en \u00e9ducation d\u2019une certaine expertise dans le domaine. C\u2019est \u00e0 travers une r\u00e9organisation singuli\u00e8re de ces ingr\u00e9dients en lien avec les \u00e9l\u00e9ments contextuels que se met en place l\u2019innovation.

In What year has the following text been written? \u29eb The author explain how students benefit from working with teaching machines. I have highlighted some sentences who demonstrate what computers bring to the classroom, to the learning experience. As soon as the student has written his response, he operates the machine and learns immediately whether he is right or wrong . This is a great improvement over the system in which papers are corrected by a teacher where the student must wait perhaps still another day to learn whether or not what he has written is right. Such immediate knowledge has two principal effects. It aids most rapidly to the formation of correct behaviour. The student quickly learns to be right. [...] Another important advantage is that the student is free to move at his own pace . With techniques in which a whole class is forced to move forward together, the bright student wastes time by waiting for others to catch up. And the slow student may not be in theory or in any other respect forced to go too fast.

Answer \u29eb This is the transcript of a video which was shot in in the mid 1950s. You can watch the video here. The author explains what are the benefits from using his teaching machine: this \"a new way\" of studying, it improves how students study, students get immediate feedback, they learn at their own pace. These are trendy words you can still read on many edtech websites. Borrowing Audrey Watters' words, I would say that B.F. Skinner\u2019s teaching machine might look like terribly out-of-date but this is the history that still shapes so much of what we say today: self-paced learning, an emphasis on real-time corrections. Edtech today draws heavily on Skinner\u2019s ideas. Is this really what we want? Behaviorism in our classrooms? Shape our students behaviour? Like Skinner did with pigeons and dogs? Can't we envision something a little more exciting than students seated in front of their computers? But let's stick with that idea that what we call innovation is sometimes quite old as we just saw. In that case, if nothing is new, what is innovation? To help you reflect on that, here's a quote (Emmanuel Davidenkoff, Le Tsunami Num\u00e9rique ) that tells us that everything has already been done when it comes to pedagogy. H\u00e9rodote et \u00c9rasme pratiquaient la learning expedition\u2008; un directeur de conscience n\u2019a pas grand-chose \u00e0 envier \u00e0 un coach\u2008; le serio ludere du Quattrocento italien pr\u00e9figure les serious games du XXIe si\u00e8cle\u2008; C\u00e9lestin Freinet n\u2019avait pas besoin de Twitter pour faire correspondre les \u00e9l\u00e8ves\u2008; la flipped classroom (classe invers\u00e9e) avec son \u00ab\u2008professeur-pr\u00e9cepteur\u2008\u00bb n\u2019est pas tr\u00e8s \u00e9loign\u00e9e du fonctionnement du lyc\u00e9e du XIXe si\u00e8cle Herodotus and Erasmus practised the learning expedition; a director of conscience has little to envy to a coach; the serio ludere of the Italian Quattrocento prefigures the serious games of the 21st century; C\u00e9lestin Freinet did not need Twitter to make pupils correspond; the flipped classroom with its \"teacher-preceptor\" is not very far from the functioning of the high school of the 19th century. One can see the ability of educational innovation to make old ideas seem new. In that regard, I would say that teachers need knowledge of the history of pedagogy. 2. If nothing is new, what is innovation? \u29eb So we tried everything. But who's we? Humankind? But what about us? What about our school? I would say that innovation is about bringing something new ( novation ) into something that already exists ( in ). This is not invention. You don't bring something that didn't exist. I can innovate if I'm doing something that I wasn't doing before. Maybe my fellow teachers were already doing it but not me. Maybe it that something we don't do in my country but that other countries do or other schools do or other parts of the school. For sure, there's something to be learn from primary teachers, from the English track/stream and so on and so forth. In fact, I would say that innovation is a relative process (not absolute). But it's important to emphasize that you don't need to invent something to be an innovator. Apple is well known to be an innovative company but they never invented a thing. They didn't invent the phone, nor the watch nor the phone. However, they brought something new in every of the afordementioned devices. So, we should ask ourselves what could we bring to our school so we are innovating? List 3 things. I'll start. I really like this quote from George Couros: Effective leadership in education is not about moving everyone from one standardized point to the next but moving individuals from their point \u201cA\u201d to their point \u201dB.\u201d Un \"leadership\" (direction) efficace dans l'\u00e9ducation ne consiste pas \u00e0 faire passer tout le monde d'un point standardis\u00e9 \u00e0 un autre, mais \u00e0 faire passer les individus de leur point \"A\" \u00e0 leur point \"B\". So my goal is to empower teachers so they get new skills. I will offer training on a weekly basis so, for instance, they become as proficient as possible, say, with Google Workspace for education. They need to take advantage of everything we already have so they can more communicate with students, design the best teaching and learning experience. But there is a risk and it's called the curse of the familiar (Justin Reich). To help you reflect on that, a cartoon: one of the women is using a new device, a vacuum cleaner, the way she used to things before the appliance was devised. This is the curse of the familiar (easily adopted technology will be those that replicate existing classroom practices). \"And even in schools that have the latest technology, teachers and administrators use that advanced equipment to do the same things they did before. A tool that could change education for the better\u2014a laptop, tablet, or interactive white board\u2014too often ends up becoming the equivalent of a thousand-dollar pencil.\" (George Couros, The Innovator\u2019s Mindset) Et m\u00eame dans les \u00e9coles qui disposent des derni\u00e8res technologies, les enseignants et les administrateurs utilisent ces \u00e9quipements de pointe pour faire les m\u00eames choses qu'avant. Un outil qui pourrait changer l'\u00e9ducation pour le mieux - un ordinateur portable, une tablette ou un tableau blanc interactif - finit trop souvent par devenir l'\u00e9quivalent d'un crayon \u00e0 mille dollars. 3. What do these next two slides have in common? \u29eb Next up, I would like to observe these two slides and the question is What do these next two slides have in common? In the first one, we have some nice drawings with sketch notes. The second one is an introduction of a blog post about innovation in education. Innovation is a central topic in education today. Innovation is about bringing something new into something existing. It's not invention, which creates from scratch, but the transformation of an existing object or process for better use or efficiency. The word innovation comes from the Latin word \"innovatio\" and was first used as an insult in Middle Age - meaning a transgression against what was considered to be immutable order (and we can say that its current meaning also denotes upheaval). From Enlightenment onwards, innovation gains a positive meaning. It is an improvement in living conditions. Nowadays, innovation is seen as a cornerstone in education and it is said that schools must innovate. Educators are called to innovating their pedagogy in order to produce young people who are prepared for the contemporary world and be able to create or make the innovations they will need. L'innovation est un sujet central dans l'\u00e9ducation aujourd'hui. L'innovation consiste \u00e0 apporter quelque chose de nouveau \u00e0 quelque chose d'existant. Il ne s'agit pas d'une invention, qui cr\u00e9e \u00e0 partir de rien, mais de la transformation d'un objet ou d'un processus existant pour une meilleure utilisation ou efficacit\u00e9. Le mot \"innovation\" vient du latin \"innovatio\" et a \u00e9t\u00e9 utilis\u00e9 pour la premi\u00e8re fois comme une insulte au Moyen \u00c2ge - signifiant une transgression de ce qui \u00e9tait consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme un ordre immuable (et nous pouvons dire que son sens actuel d\u00e9note \u00e9galement un bouleversement). \u00c0 partir du si\u00e8cle des Lumi\u00e8res, l'innovation acquiert une signification positive. Elle correspond \u00e0 une am\u00e9lioration des conditions de vie. De nos jours, l'innovation est consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme une pierre angulaire de l'\u00e9ducation et il est dit que les \u00e9coles doivent innover. Les \u00e9ducateurs sont appel\u00e9s \u00e0 innover dans leur p\u00e9dagogie afin de former des jeunes qui soient pr\u00e9par\u00e9s au monde contemporain et capables de cr\u00e9er ou de r\u00e9aliser les innovations dont ils auront besoin. The answer to that question is that none of them have been created by a human person. Midjourney, GPT-3\u2026 Machines are doing human jobs. Is AI a threat? Yes and no. Think about Kasparov loosing against Deep BLue. Was is still worth it to play chess since the machines were more powerful than human beings (and truly one can see now thirty years after that no one has given up on chess. On the contrary). Kasparov's idea was that it's no use to compete with machines. Instead, we should learn to work with machines (Centaur's metaphor). Indeed, I see great opportunity using OpenAI and for instance it's last product (Whisper). One can easily a time where a journalist speaking only german will be able to have a conversation with a chinese one. Machines will do the real time translation (and for that matter, you'll get a full transcript with important passages underlined). And to be fair, it's really not SF (think of Otter for instance). So I guess our good old Four Cs are still relevant today. We need to learn to collaborate for instance. And we desperatly need digital skills. The EU reminds us that 42% who are currently unemployed don't have digital competences. But one can easily see that AI is going to destroy the jobs that can be automated (See Yuval Noah Harari about that). But what we said remains true: our students need skills that we'll spare them from being easily replaced. 4. What is left to human beings? \u29eb This quote makes me laugh. \"When I read about autowriters and autograders, I like to imagine students downloading and running computer programs that automatically write essays while instructors use computers to automatically grade those essays. While the computers instantaneously pass these essays and grades back and forth, students and instructors can retire to a grassy quad, sitting together in the warm sun, holding forth on grand ideas and helping each other learn.\" (Justin Reich, Failure to Disrupt) Lorsque je lis des articles sur les r\u00e9dacteurs et les correcteurs automatiques, j'aime imaginer que les \u00e9tudiants t\u00e9l\u00e9chargent et ex\u00e9cutent des programmes informatiques qui r\u00e9digent automatiquement des dissertations, tandis que les instructeurs utilisent des ordinateurs pour noter automatiquement ces dissertations. Pendant que les ordinateurs transmettent instantan\u00e9ment ces dissertations et ces notes, les \u00e9tudiants et les enseignants peuvent se retirer sur une pelouse, s'asseoir ensemble au soleil, discuter de grandes id\u00e9es et s'aider mutuellement \u00e0 apprendre. First, it brings back to our first point. We have something more interesting that putting every students on a computers with an adaptative tutor or an AI software. Secondly, it reminds us that machines are there to do the tedious work. But let's answer to that question What is left to human beings? In fact, we alredy answered this but I do believe that powerful machines are going not to kill creativity but to spark it. That's really one can see when loggin on a Discord channel and see what you can do with Midjourney, people creating new drawings even comics. Finally, I would argue that machines would be our new gods. According to Bidar, by conceiving deity, we have a model to compete with. Le coup de g\u00e9nie est l\u00e0 : en concevant quelque chose comme le divin, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire l\u2019\u00eatre sup\u00e9rieur en tout et sup\u00e9rieur \u00e0 tout, au temps, \u00e0 l\u2019espace, \u00e0 la vie, \u00e0 la mort, l\u2019\u00eatre humain se donne \u00e0 lui-m\u00eame le d\u00e9fi supr\u00eame d\u2019entrer en dialogue avec cet interlocuteur sublime, d\u2019exister par soi-m\u00eame face \u00e0 cet adversaire tout-puissant, de s\u2019\u00e9lancer sans fin vers cet horizon irrattrapable. (Abdennour Bidar, Histoire De l'Humanisme en Occident) The stroke of genius is there: by conceiving something like the divine, that is to say the being superior in everything and superior to everything, to time, to space, to life, to death, the human being gives himself the supreme challenge of entering into dialogue with this sublime interlocutor, of existing by himself in the face of this all-powerful adversary, of rushing endlessly towards this irrecoverable horizon. Of course, that's a joke. But isn't something great that you can train yourself to better at chess using a computer or to learn a foreign language? What about you? What would you say. List three things that machines can\u2019t perform or tell how AI will transform education (note that I\u2019m not saying disrupting). 5. Why do we need to innovate? \u29eb This is the final question. We saw what is innovation and how we could innovate. We also gave one reason to innovate, to bring technology into the classroom so our students gain new skills. But there's is more than that. So why should schools innovate? Why this word became so trendy? Why is it absolutely necessary? Or not if you think so. There's a lot to be said about that (and particurlaly why this word became trendy) but I would focus on one thing. The world is on fire. We desperatly need to educate people not to destroy the earth, not to saw off the branch on which they are sitting. In 1934, the great Swiss psychologist Jean Piaget said, \u201cOnly education is capable of saving our societies from possible collapse\u201d. Well, isn't it more true than ever? A war, a pandemic, global warming... So how would you modify the curriculum so it fits these new urgent needs? Can you list three things? Conclusion \u29eb Our initial question was What is innovation? Let's sum up. Innovation is about bringing something new into something that already exists. This is not invention. You don't bring something that didn't exist. But we also saw the ability of educational innovation to make old ideas seem new. Innovation a relative process. You may doing something new that your fellow teachers were already doing but you were not. So, we need to invite teachers to try new things. It can be a lot of things (a new pedagogical approch, a new app, a new way of collaborating...). We need to forster that willingness to try new things by creating opportunities (teacher are able to meet each other, to work together, to collaborate...). Having an Innovation Day or a Passion Day would be meaningful. People would share their passion. We would need a place where students could build things (fablabs)... I would add that more than every teachers have to team up with computers. They are not a the center of the stage anymore. They are more the guide on the side (using AI among other things). But why do we want to innovate? Like any startup in Silicon Valley, we could say we want to make the world a better place. We wan't students to work better and to be happy. So innovation is a positive word. We need to innovate so the education we provide is helping students to overcome challenges. Let's remember that, according to the EU, 42% of people currently unemployed have no digital skills whatsoever. Also, we need to innovate because it is now urgent. War, pandemic, global warming are wreaking havoc. We desperatly need to educate students. \"Only education is capable of saving our societies from possible collapse\", said Jean Piaget.","title":"What is innovation"},{"location":"Documentation/Innovation/What%20is%20innovation/#1-in-what-year-has-the-following-text-been-written","text":"The author explain how students benefit from working with teaching machines.

They didn't invent the phone, nor the watch nor the phone. However, they brought something new in every of the afordementioned devices. So, we should ask ourselves what could we bring to our school so we are innovating? List 3 things. I'll start. I really like this quote from George Couros: Effective leadership in education is not about moving everyone from one standardized point to the next but moving individuals from their point \u201cA\u201d to their point \u201dB.\u201d Un \"leadership\" (direction) efficace dans l'\u00e9ducation ne consiste pas \u00e0 faire passer tout le monde d'un point standardis\u00e9 \u00e0 un autre, mais \u00e0 faire passer les individus de leur point \"A\" \u00e0 leur point \"B\". So my goal is to empower teachers so they get new skills. I will offer training on a weekly basis so, for instance, they become as proficient as possible, say, with Google Workspace for education. They need to take advantage of everything we already have so they can more communicate with students, design the best teaching and learning experience. But there is a risk and it's called the curse of the familiar (Justin Reich). To help you reflect on that, a cartoon: one of the women is using a new device, a vacuum cleaner, the way she used to things before the appliance was devised. This is the curse of the familiar (easily adopted technology will be those that replicate existing classroom practices). \"And even in schools that have the latest technology, teachers and administrators use that advanced equipment to do the same things they did before. A tool that could change education for the better\u2014a laptop, tablet, or interactive white board\u2014too often ends up becoming the equivalent of a thousand-dollar pencil.\" (George Couros, The Innovator\u2019s Mindset) Et m\u00eame dans les \u00e9coles qui disposent des derni\u00e8res technologies, les enseignants et les administrateurs utilisent ces \u00e9quipements de pointe pour faire les m\u00eames choses qu'avant. Un outil qui pourrait changer l'\u00e9ducation pour le mieux - un ordinateur portable, une tablette ou un tableau blanc interactif - finit trop souvent par devenir l'\u00e9quivalent d'un crayon \u00e0 mille dollars.","title":"2. If nothing is new, what is innovation?"},{"location":"Documentation/Innovation/What%20is%20innovation/#3-what-do-these-next-two-slides-have-in-common","text":"Next up, I would like to observe these two slides and the question is What do these next two slides have in common? In the first one, we have some nice drawings with sketch notes. The second one is an introduction of a blog post about innovation in education. Innovation is a central topic in education today. Innovation is about bringing something new into something existing. It's not invention, which creates from scratch, but the transformation of an existing object or process for better use or efficiency. The word innovation comes from the Latin word \"innovatio\" and was first used as an insult in Middle Age - meaning a transgression against what was considered to be immutable order (and we can say that its current meaning also denotes upheaval). From Enlightenment onwards, innovation gains a positive meaning. It is an improvement in living conditions. Nowadays, innovation is seen as a cornerstone in education and it is said that schools must innovate. Educators are called to innovating their pedagogy in order to produce young people who are prepared for the contemporary world and be able to create or make the innovations they will need. L'innovation est un sujet central dans l'\u00e9ducation aujourd'hui. L'innovation consiste \u00e0 apporter quelque chose de nouveau \u00e0 quelque chose d'existant. Il ne s'agit pas d'une invention, qui cr\u00e9e \u00e0 partir de rien, mais de la transformation d'un objet ou d'un processus existant pour une meilleure utilisation ou efficacit\u00e9. Le mot \"innovation\" vient du latin \"innovatio\" et a \u00e9t\u00e9 utilis\u00e9 pour la premi\u00e8re fois comme une insulte au Moyen \u00c2ge - signifiant une transgression de ce qui \u00e9tait consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme un ordre immuable (et nous pouvons dire que son sens actuel d\u00e9note \u00e9galement un bouleversement). \u00c0 partir du si\u00e8cle des Lumi\u00e8res, l'innovation acquiert une signification positive. Elle correspond \u00e0 une am\u00e9lioration des conditions de vie. De nos jours, l'innovation est consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme une pierre angulaire de l'\u00e9ducation et il est dit que les \u00e9coles doivent innover. Les \u00e9ducateurs sont appel\u00e9s \u00e0 innover dans leur p\u00e9dagogie afin de former des jeunes qui soient pr\u00e9par\u00e9s au monde contemporain et capables de cr\u00e9er ou de r\u00e9aliser les innovations dont ils auront besoin. The answer to that question is that none of them have been created by a human person. Midjourney, GPT-3\u2026 Machines are doing human jobs. Is AI a threat? Yes and no. Think about Kasparov loosing against Deep BLue. Was is still worth it to play chess since the machines were more powerful than human beings (and truly one can see now thirty years after that no one has given up on chess. On the contrary). Kasparov's idea was that it's no use to compete with machines. Instead, we should learn to work with machines (Centaur's metaphor). Indeed, I see great opportunity using OpenAI and for instance it's last product (Whisper). One can easily a time where a journalist speaking only german will be able to have a conversation with a chinese one. Machines will do the real time translation (and for that matter, you'll get a full transcript with important passages underlined). And to be fair, it's really not SF (think of Otter for instance). So I guess our good old Four Cs are still relevant today. We need to learn to collaborate for instance. And we desperatly need digital skills. The EU reminds us that 42% who are currently unemployed don't have digital competences. But one can easily see that AI is going to destroy the jobs that can be automated (See Yuval Noah Harari about that). But what we said remains true: our students need skills that we'll spare them from being easily replaced.","title":"3. What do these next two slides have in common?"},{"location":"Documentation/Innovation/What%20is%20innovation/#4-what-is-left-to-human-beings","text":"This quote makes me laugh. \"When I read about autowriters and autograders, I like to imagine students downloading and running computer programs that automatically write essays while instructors use computers to automatically grade those essays. While the computers instantaneously pass these essays and grades back and forth, students and instructors can retire to a grassy quad, sitting together in the warm sun, holding forth on grand ideas and helping each other learn.\" (Justin Reich, Failure to Disrupt) Lorsque je lis des articles sur les r\u00e9dacteurs et les correcteurs automatiques, j'aime imaginer que les \u00e9tudiants t\u00e9l\u00e9chargent et ex\u00e9cutent des programmes informatiques qui r\u00e9digent automatiquement des dissertations, tandis que les instructeurs utilisent des ordinateurs pour noter automatiquement ces dissertations. Pendant que les ordinateurs transmettent instantan\u00e9ment ces dissertations et ces notes, les \u00e9tudiants et les enseignants peuvent se retirer sur une pelouse, s'asseoir ensemble au soleil, discuter de grandes id\u00e9es et s'aider mutuellement \u00e0 apprendre. First, it brings back to our first point. We have something more interesting that putting every students on a computers with an adaptative tutor or an AI software. Secondly, it reminds us that machines are there to do the tedious work. But let's answer to that question What is left to human beings? In fact, we alredy answered this but I do believe that powerful machines are going not to kill creativity but to spark it. That's really one can see when loggin on a Discord channel and see what you can do with Midjourney, people creating new drawings even comics. Finally, I would argue that machines would be our new gods. According to Bidar, by conceiving deity, we have a model to compete with. Le coup de g\u00e9nie est l\u00e0 : en concevant quelque chose comme le divin, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire l\u2019\u00eatre sup\u00e9rieur en tout et sup\u00e9rieur \u00e0 tout, au temps, \u00e0 l\u2019espace, \u00e0 la vie, \u00e0 la mort, l\u2019\u00eatre humain se donne \u00e0 lui-m\u00eame le d\u00e9fi supr\u00eame d\u2019entrer en dialogue avec cet interlocuteur sublime, d\u2019exister par soi-m\u00eame face \u00e0 cet adversaire tout-puissant, de s\u2019\u00e9lancer sans fin vers cet horizon irrattrapable. (Abdennour Bidar, Histoire De l'Humanisme en Occident) The stroke of genius is there: by conceiving something like the divine, that is to say the being superior in everything and superior to everything, to time, to space, to life, to death, the human being gives himself the supreme challenge of entering into dialogue with this sublime interlocutor, of existing by himself in the face of this all-powerful adversary, of rushing endlessly towards this irrecoverable horizon. Of course, that's a joke. But isn't something great that you can train yourself to better at chess using a computer or to learn a foreign language? What about you? What would you say. List three things that machines can\u2019t perform or tell how AI will transform education (note that I\u2019m not saying disrupting).","title":"4. What is left to human beings?"},{"location":"Documentation/Innovation/What%20is%20innovation/#5-why-do-we-need-to-innovate","text":"This is the final question. We saw what is innovation and how we could innovate. We also gave one reason to innovate, to bring technology into the classroom so our students gain new skills. But there's is more than that. So why should schools innovate? Why this word became so trendy? Why is it absolutely necessary? Or not if you think so. There's a lot to be said about that (and particurlaly why this word became trendy) but I would focus on one thing. The world is on fire. We desperatly need to educate people not to destroy the earth, not to saw off the branch on which they are sitting. In 1934, the great Swiss psychologist Jean Piaget said, \u201cOnly education is capable of saving our societies from possible collapse\u201d. Well, isn't it more true than ever? A war, a pandemic, global warming... So how would you modify the curriculum so it fits these new urgent needs? Can you list three things?","title":"5. Why do we need to innovate?"},{"location":"Documentation/Innovation/What%20is%20innovation/#conclusion","text":"Our initial question was What is innovation? Let's sum up. Innovation is about bringing something new into something that already exists. This is not invention. You don't bring something that didn't exist. But we also saw the ability of educational innovation to make old ideas seem new. Innovation a relative process. You may doing something new that your fellow teachers were already doing but you were not. So, we need to invite teachers to try new things. It can be a lot of things (a new pedagogical approch, a new app, a new way of collaborating...). We need to forster that willingness to try new things by creating opportunities (teacher are able to meet each other, to work together, to collaborate...). Having an Innovation Day or a Passion Day would be meaningful. People would share their passion. We would need a place where students could build things (fablabs)... I would add that more than every teachers have to team up with computers. They are not a the center of the stage anymore. They are more the guide on the side (using AI among other things). But why do we want to innovate? Like any startup in Silicon Valley, we could say we want to make the world a better place. We wan't students to work better and to be happy. So innovation is a positive word. We need to innovate so the education we provide is helping students to overcome challenges. Let's remember that, according to the EU, 42% of people currently unemployed have no digital skills whatsoever. Also, we need to innovate because it is now urgent. War, pandemic, global warming are wreaking havoc. We desperatly need to educate students. \"Only education is capable of saving our societies from possible collapse\", said Jean Piaget.","title":"Conclusion"},{"location":"Documentation/Innovation/What%20the%20Gospel%20of%20Innovation%20Gets%20Wrong/","text":"What the Gospel of Innovation Gets Wrong | The New Yorker Unable to persuade its established consumers to buy a hydraulic excavator, Bucyrus introduced a hybrid product, called the Hydrohoe, in 1951\u2014a merely sustaining innovation. Christensen says that Bucyrus \u201clogged record profits until 1966\u2014the point at which the disruptive hydraulics technology had squarely intersected with customers\u2019 needs,\u201d and then began to decline. \u201cThis is typical of industries facing a disruptive technology,\u201d he explains. \u201cThe leading firms in the established technology remain financially strong until the disruptive technology is, in fact, in the midst of their mainstream market.\u201d But, actually, between 1962 and 1979 Bucyrus\u2019s sales grew sevenfold and its profits grew twenty-five-fold. Was that so bad? In the nineteen-eighties, Bucyrus suffered. The whole construction-equipment industry did: it was devastated by recession, inflation, the oil crisis, a drop in home building, and the slowing of highway construction. (Caterpillar sustained heavy losses, too.) In the early nineteen-nineties, after a disastrous leveraged buyout handled by Goldman Sachs, Bucyrus entered Chapter 11 protection, but it made some sizable acquisitions when it emerged, as Bucyrus International, and was a leading maker of mining equipment, just as it had been a century earlier. Was it a failure? Caterpillar didn\u2019t think so when, in 2011, it bought the firm for nearly nine billion dollars. Christensen\u2019s sources are often dubious and his logic questionable. His single citation for his investigation of the \u201cdisruptive transition from mechanical to electronic motor controls,\u201d in which he identifies the Allen-Bradley Company as triumphing over four rivals, is a book called \u201cThe Bradley Legacy,\u201d an account published by a foundation established by the company\u2019s founders. This is akin to calling an actor the greatest talent in a generation after interviewing his publicist. \u201cUse theory to help guide data collection,\u201d Christensen advises. He finds further evidence of his theory in the disruption of the department store by the discount store. \u201cJust as in disk drives and excavators,\u201d he writes, \u201ca few of the leading traditional retailers\u2014notably S. S. Kresge, F. W. Woolworth, and Dayton Hudson\u2014saw the disruptive approach coming and invested early.\u201d In 1962, Kresge (which traces its origins to 1897) opened Kmart; Dayton-Hudson (1902) opened Target; and Woolworth (1879) opened Woolco. Kresge and Dayton-Hudson ran their discount stores as independent organizations; Woolworth ran its discount store in-house. Kmart and Target succeeded; Woolco failed. Christensen presents this story as yet more evidence of an axiom derived from the disk-drive industry: \u201ctwo models for how to make money cannot peacefully coexist within a single organization.\u201d In the mid-nineteen-nineties, Kmart closed more than two hundred stores, a fact that Christensen does not include in his account of the industry\u2019s history. (Kmart filed for bankruptcy in 2002.) Only in a footnote does he make a vague allusion to Kmart\u2019s troubles\u2014\u201cwhen this book was being written, Kmart was a crippled company\u201d\u2014and then he dismisses this piece of counter-evidence by fiat: \u201cKmart\u2019s present competitive struggles are unrelated to Kresge\u2019s strategy in meeting the original disruptive threat of discounting.\u201d In his discussion of the steel industry, in which he argues that established companies were disrupted by the technology of minimilling (melting down scrap metal to make cheaper, lower-quality sheet metal), Christensen writes that U.S. Steel, founded in 1901, lowered the cost of steel production from \u201cnine labor-hours per ton of steel produced in 1980 to just under three hours per ton in 1991,\u201d which he attributes to the company\u2019s \u201cferociously attacking the size of its workforce, paring it from more than 93,000 in 1980 to fewer than 23,000 in 1991,\u201d in order to point out that even this accomplishment could not stop the coming disruption. Christensen tends to ignore factors that don\u2019t support his theory. Factors having effects on both production and profitability that Christensen does not mention are that, between 1986 and 1987, twenty-two thousand workers at U.S. Steel did not go to work, as part of a labor action, and that U.S. Steel\u2019s workers are unionized and have been for generations, while minimill manufacturers, with their newer workforces, are generally non-union. Christensen\u2019s logic here seems to be that the industry\u2019s labor arrangements can have played no role in U.S. Steel\u2019s struggles\u2014and are not even worth mentioning\u2014because U.S. Steel\u2019s struggles must be a function of its having failed to build minimills. U.S. Steel\u2019s struggles have been and remain grave, but its failure is by no means a matter of historical record. Today, the largest U.S. producer of steel is\u2014U.S. Steel. The theory of disruption is meant to be predictive. On March 10, 2000, Christensen launched a $3.8-million Disruptive Growth Fund, which he managed with Neil Eisner, a broker in St. Louis. Christensen drew on his theory to select stocks. Less than a year later, the fund was quietly liquidated: during a stretch of time when the Nasdaq lost fifty per cent of its value, the Disruptive Growth Fund lost sixty-four per cent. In 2007, Christensen told Business Week that \u201cthe prediction of the theory would be that Apple won\u2019t succeed with the iPhone,\u201d adding, \u201cHistory speaks pretty loudly on that.\u201d In its first five years, the iPhone generated a hundred and fifty billion dollars of revenue. In the preface to the 2011 edition of \u201cThe Innovator\u2019s Dilemma,\u201d Christensen reports that, since the book\u2019s publication, in 1997, \u201cthe theory of disruption continues to yield predictions that are quite accurate.\u201d This is less because people have used his model to make accurate predictions about things that haven\u2019t happened yet than because disruption has been sold as advice, and because much that happened between 1997 and 2011 looks, in retrospect, disruptive. Disruptive innovation can reliably be seen only after the fact. History speaks loudly, apparently, only when you can make it say what you want it to say. The popular incarnation of the theory tends to disavow history altogether. \u201cPredicting the future based on the past is like betting on a football team simply because it won the Super Bowl a decade ago,\u201d Josh Linkner writes in \u201cThe Road to Reinvention.\u201d His first principle: \u201cLet go of the past.\u201d It has nothing to tell you. But, unless you already believe in disruption, many of the successes that have been labelled disruptive innovation look like something else, and many of the failures that are often seen to have resulted from failing to embrace disruptive innovation look like bad management. Christensen has compared the theory of disruptive innovation to a theory of nature: the theory of evolution. But among the many differences between disruption and evolution is that the advocates of disruption have an affinity for circular arguments. If an established company doesn\u2019t disrupt, it will fail, and if it fails it must be because it didn\u2019t disrupt. When a startup fails, that\u2019s a success, since epidemic failure is a hallmark of disruptive innovation. (\u201cStop being afraid of failure and start embracing it,\u201d the organizers of FailCon, an annual conference, implore, suggesting that, in the era of disruption, innovators face unprecedented challenges. For instance: maybe you made the wrong hires?) When an established company succeeds, that\u2019s only because it hasn\u2019t yet failed. And, when any of these things happen, all of them are only further evidence of disruption. The handpicked case study, which is Christensen\u2019s method, is a notoriously weak foundation on which to build a theory. But, if the handpicked case study is the approved approach, it would seem that efforts at embracing disruptive innovation are often fatal. Morrison-Knudsen, an engineering and construction firm, got its start in 1905 and helped build more than a hundred and fifty dams all over the world, including the Hoover. Beginning in 1988, a new C.E.O., William Agee, looked to new products and new markets, and, after Bill Clinton\u2019s election, in 1992, bet on mass transit, turning to the construction of both commuter and long-distance train cars through two subsidiaries, MK Transit and MK Rail. These disruptive businesses proved to be a disaster. Morrison-Knudsen announced in 1995 that it had lost three hundred and fifty million dollars, by which point the company had essentially collapsed\u2014not because it didn\u2019t disruptively innovate but because it did. Time, Inc., founded in 1922, auto-disrupted, too. In 1994, the company launched Pathfinder, an early new-media venture, an umbrella Web site for its magazines, at a cost estimated to have exceeded a hundred million dollars; the site was abandoned in 1999. Had Pathfinder been successful, it would have been greeted, retrospectively, as evidence of disruptive innovation. Instead, as one of its producers put it, \u201cit\u2019s like it never existed.\u201d In the late nineteen-nineties and early two-thousands, the financial-services industry innovated by selling products like subprime mortgages, collateralized debt obligations, and mortgage-backed securities, some to a previously untapped customer base. At the time, Ed Clark was the C.E.O. of Canada\u2019s TD Bank, which traces its roots to 1855. Clark, who earned a Ph.D. in economics at Harvard with a dissertation on public investment in Tanzania, forswore Canada\u2019s version of this disruptive innovation, asset-backed commercial paper. The decision made TD Bank one of the strongest banks in the world. Between 2002 and 2012, TD Bank\u2019s assets increased from \\(278 billion to \\) 806 billion. Since 2005, TD Bank has opened thirteen hundred branches in the United States, bought Commerce Bank for $8.5 billion, in 2008, and adopted the motto \u201cAmerica\u2019s Most Convenient Bank.\u201d With the money it earned by expanding its traditional banking services\u2014almost four billion dollars a year during the height of the financial crisis, according to the Canadian business reporter Howard Green\u2014it set about marketing itself as the bank with the longest hours, the best teller services, and free dog biscuits. When the financial-services industry disruptively innovated, it led to a global financial crisis. Like the bursting of the dot-com bubble, the meltdown didn\u2019t dim the fervor for disruption; instead, it fuelled it, because these products of disruption contributed to the panic on which the theory of disruption thrives. Disruptive innovation as an explanation for how change happens is everywhere. Ideas that come from business schools are exceptionally well marketed. Faith in disruption is the best illustration, and the worst case, of a larger historical transformation having to do with secularization, and what happens when the invisible hand replaces the hand of God as explanation and justification. Innovation and disruption are ideas that originated in the arena of business but which have since been applied to arenas whose values and goals are remote from the values and goals of business. People aren\u2019t disk drives. Public schools, colleges and universities, churches, museums, and many hospitals, all of which have been subjected to disruptive innovation, have revenues and expenses and infrastructures, but they aren\u2019t industries in the same way that manufacturers of hard-disk drives or truck engines or drygoods are industries. Journalism isn\u2019t an industry in that sense, either. Doctors have obligations to their patients, teachers to their students, pastors to their congregations, curators to the public, and journalists to their readers\u2014obligations that lie outside the realm of earnings, and are fundamentally different from the obligations that a business executive has to employees, partners, and investors. Historically, institutions like museums, hospitals, schools, and universities have been supported by patronage, donations made by individuals or funding from church or state. The press has generally supported itself by charging subscribers and selling advertising. (Underwriting by corporations and foundations is a funding source of more recent vintage.) Charging for admission, membership, subscriptions and, for some, earning profits are similarities these institutions have with businesses. Still, that doesn\u2019t make them industries, which turn things into commodities and sell them for gain. In \u201cThe Innovative University,\u201d written with Henry J. Eyring, who used to work at the Monitor Group, a consulting firm co-founded by Michael Porter, Christensen subjected Harvard, a college founded by seventeenth-century theocrats, to his case-study analysis. \u201cStudying the university\u2019s history,\u201d Christensen and Eyring wrote, \u201cwill allow us to move beyond the forlorn language of crisis to hopeful and practical strategies for success.\u201d On the basis of this research, Christensen and Eyring\u2019s recommendations for the disruption of the modern university include a \u201cmix of face-to-face and online learning.\u201d The publication of \u201cThe Innovative University,\u201d in 2011, contributed to a frenzy for Massive Open Online Courses, or mooc_s, at colleges and universities across the country, including a collaboration between Harvard and M.I.T., which was announced in May of 2012. Shortly afterward, the University of Virginia\u2019s panicked board of trustees attempted to fire the president, charging her with jeopardizing the institution\u2019s future by failing to disruptively innovate with sufficient speed; the vice-chair of the board forwarded to the chair a _Times column written by David Brooks, \u201cThe Campus Tsunami,\u201d in which he cited Christensen. Christensen and Eyring\u2019s recommendation of a \u201cmix of face-to-face and online learning\u201d was drawn from an investigation that involves a wildly misguided attempt to apply standards of instruction in the twenty-first century to standards of instruction in the seventeenth. One table in the book, titled \u201cHarvard\u2019s Initial DNA, 1636-1707,\u201d looks like this: Initial Traits Implications Small, face-to-face classes High faculty-student intimacy Low instructional efficiency Classical, religious instruction High moral content in the curriculum Narrow curriculum with low practicality for non-pastors Nonspecialized faculty Dogmatic instruction High faculty empathy for learners Low faculty expertise In 2014, there were twenty-one thousand students at Harvard. In 1640, there were thirteen. The first year classes were held, Harvard students and their \u201cnonspecialized faculty\u201d (one young schoolmaster, Nathaniel Eaton), enjoying \u201csmall, face-to-face classes\u201d (Eaton\u2019s wife, who fed the students, was accused of putting \u201cgoat\u2019s dung in their hasty pudding\u201d) with \u201chigh faculty empathy for learners\u201d (Eaton conducted thrashings with a stick of walnut said to have been \u201cbig enough to have killed a horse\u201d), could have paddled together in a single canoe. That doesn\u2019t mean good arguments can\u2019t be made for online education. But there\u2019s nothing factually persuasive in this account of its historical urgency and even inevitability, which relies on a method well outside anything resembling plausible historical analysis. Christensen and Eyring also urge universities to establish \u201cheavyweight innovation teams\u201d: Christensen thinks that R. & D. departments housed within a business and accountable to its executives are structurally unable to innovate disruptively\u2014they are preoccupied with pleasing existing customers through incremental improvement. Christensen argues, for instance, that if Digital Equipment Corporation, which was doing very well making minicomputers in the nineteen-sixties and seventies, had founded, in the eighties, a separate company at another location to develop the personal computer, it might have triumphed. The logic of disruptive innovation is the logic of the startup: establish a team of innovators, set a whiteboard under a blue sky, and never ask them to make a profit, because there needs to be a wall of separation between the people whose job is to come up with the best, smartest, and most creative and important ideas and the people whose job is to make money by selling stuff. Interestingly, a similar principle has existed, for more than a century, in the press. The \u201cheavyweight innovation team\u201d? That\u2019s what journalists used to call the \u201cnewsroom.\u201d It\u2019s readily apparent that, in a democracy, the important business interests of institutions like the press might at times conflict with what became known as the \u201cpublic interest.\u201d That\u2019s why, a very long time ago, newspapers like the Times and magazines like this one established a wall of separation between the editorial side of affairs and the business side. (The metaphor is to the Jeffersonian wall between church and state.) \u201cThe wall dividing the newsroom and business side has served The Times well for decades,\u201d according to the Times \u2019 Innovation Report, \u201callowing one side to focus on readers and the other to focus on advertisers,\u201d as if this had been, all along, simply a matter of office efficiency. But the notion of a wall should be abandoned, according to the report, because it has \u201chidden costs\u201d that thwart innovation. Earlier this year, the Times tried to recruit, as its new head of audience development, Michael Wertheim, the former head of promotion at the disruptive media outfit Upworthy. Wertheim turned the Times job down, citing its wall as too big an obstacle to disruptive innovation. The recommendation of the Innovation Report is to understand that both sides, editorial and business, share, as their top priority, \u201cReader Experience,\u201d which can be measured, following Upworthy, in \u201cAttention Minutes.\u201d Vox Media, a digital-media disrupter that is mentioned ten times in the Times report and is included, along with BuzzFeed, in a list of the Times \u2019 strongest competitors (few of which are profitable), called the report \u201cbrilliant,\u201d \u201cshockingly good,\u201d and an \u201cinsanely clear\u201d explanation of disruption, but expressed the view that there\u2019s no way the Times will implement its recommendations, because \u201cwhat the report doesn\u2019t mention is the sobering conclusion of Christensen\u2019s research: companies faced with disruptive threats almost never manage to handle them gracefully.\u201d Disruptive innovation is a theory about why businesses fail. It\u2019s not more than that. It doesn\u2019t explain change. It\u2019s not a law of nature. It\u2019s an artifact of history, an idea, forged in time; it\u2019s the manufacture of a moment of upsetting and edgy uncertainty. Transfixed by change, it\u2019s blind to continuity. It makes a very poor prophet. The upstarts who work at startups don\u2019t often stay at any one place for very long. (Three out of four startups fail. More than nine out of ten never earn a return.) They work a year here, a few months there\u2014zany hours everywhere. They wear jeans and sneakers and ride scooters and share offices and sprawl on couches like Great Danes. Their coffee machines look like dollhouse-size factories. They are told that they should be reckless and ruthless. Their investors, if they\u2019re like Josh Linkner, tell them that the world is a terrifying place, moving at a devastating pace. \u201cToday I run a venture capital firm and back the next generation of innovators who are, as I was throughout my earlier career, dead-focused on eating your lunch,\u201d Linkner writes. His job appears to be to convince a generation of people who want to do good and do well to learn, instead, remorselessness. Forget rules, obligations, your conscience, loyalty, a sense of the commonweal. If you start a business and it succeeds, Linkner advises, sell it and take the cash. Don\u2019t look back. Never pause. Disrupt or be disrupted. But they do pause and they do look back, and they wonder. Meanwhile, they tweet, they post, they tumble in and out of love, they ponder. They send one another sly messages, touching the screens of sleek, soundless machines with a worshipful tenderness. They swap novels: David Foster Wallace, Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie, Zadie Smith. \u201cSteppenwolf\u201d is still available in print, five dollars cheaper as an e-book. He\u2019s a wolf, he\u2019s a man. The rest is unreadable. So, as ever, is the future. \u2666","title":"What the Gospel of Innovation Gets Wrong"},{"location":"Documentation/Innovation/%C3%80%20lire/","tags":["documentation","innovation"],"text":"A lire/voir \u29eb \u00abJasons p\u00e9dagogie num\u00e9rique\u00bb \u2014 \u00c9pisode 6: L\u2019innovation p\u00e9dagogique \u00e0 la port\u00e9e de tous les enseignants? - \u00c9ductive Revisiter 10 ans apr\u00e8s ce qui a bien march\u00e9 en temps de crise. d'apr\u00e8s la carte de l'innovation Changement et innovation en \u00e9ducation : deux notions en r\u00e9sonance Creating Innovators: The Making of Young People Who Will Change the World, Tony Wagner BOOK (2012) The Innovator\u2019s Mindset: Empower Learning, Unleash Talent, and Lead a Culture of Creativity, George Couros BOOK (2015) Comment le handicap inspire-t-il l'innovation ? - Simon Houriez 1 TIME Innovative Teacher Helps Students with Disabilities Tap Their Superpowers 2 Innovation in Education Workshop (pr\u00e9sentation de Jean) Global Innovation Index | Tracking Innovation through the COVID-19 Crisis Cr\u00e9ation d\u2019un cours de Smurtz en atelier p\u00e9dagogique hybride !

I\u2019d like to see AI-assisted science where you have effectively AI research assistants that do a lot of the drudgery work and surface interesting articles, find structure in vast amounts of data, and then surface that to the human experts and scientists who can make quicker breakthroughs.

I can specify the length if the learning time I am designing for and the tool will automatically calculate how much time I have used. This helps me check I am not planning too much or too little for my learners [...]. So the next thing to do is to start building the detail. So I click this button which will add what we call a TLA or a set of teaching and learning activities . Well I need to give my TLA a name \u2014 and I am going to highlight that this will involve individual activities completed online and I need to decide what kind of learning experiences the students should have. I can choose from six learning types: Read watch listen , Collaborate , Discuss , Investigate , Practice , Produce [...] A pie chart shows you the proportion of activities that the students are going to experience. You can visualize the design of your lesson plan . To Sum Things Up \u29eb R\u00c9F\u00c9RENCE \u00c0 RETROUVER This design tool will help with the now urgent process of moving your teaching online . The Learning Designer is an online tool to help teachers and lecturers design teaching and learning activities and share their learning designs with each other. The tool is based on the six learning types from Diana Laurillard\u2019s Conversational Framework \u2013 a model of the conditions necessary for learning to take place. The six learning types are: Read/Write/Listen (or Acquisition) , Inquiry , Practice , Production , Discussion and Collaboration . In principle, a good learning design will contain a mix of all of these types of learning . The tool provides feedback on your design by showing you (a) the amount of learning time you have designed, and (b) a pie chart of the proportion of each of the six learning types in your design. You decide what adjustments to make. In principle, a good learning design will contain a mix of all of these types of learning . The Analysis tab also shows the proportions of time learners spend online , with the teacher present , and as a class, group or individual .","title":"5.

ABC Learning designer on a spreadsheet > 7. A more student-centered approach Discussing with one of my colleagues, we developed the idea that it would be very useful to produce a tool specifically designed for students so they can better understand the process of learning. They would also become more autonomous if they know exactly what to do to learn something. They don't need to hear about learning design nor the conversational framework. They just need to know \"what it takes to learn\" (therefore, the learning types). I made this video (\ud83d\udc47) to explain what are the learning types. ![[learning-types.mp4]] And this gif too: Here's an example for reading and produce a book review (Year 12/13). Each learning type is correlated to the Bloom\u2019s Taxonomy . The verbs used in the taxonomy can easily be understood as tasks to accomplish. \u26a0\ufe0f This is an early draft you can browse in Trello . The Kanban Framework (it's a board you can easily modify) is simple enough to engage students through a rather complex topic. Kanban boards visually depict work at various stages of a process using cards to represent work items and columns to represent each stage of the process. Cards are moved from left to right to show progress and to help coordinate teams performing the work. A Kanban board may be divided into horizontal \"swimlanes\" representing different kinds of work or different teams performing the work. -> Top 10 Free Kanban Boards For Productive Teams in 2020 I thought it would be convenient for students to visualize the learning types, to modify them, to add their own workflow and proof of work. They also can add links, tags, collaborators and even dates. This could also be done with, A padlet ? Miro ? Obsidian (with the Kanban plugin)? A spreadsheet?","title":"7.

However, the inevitability of teaching shaped by machines must not make us forget these questions: what is the pedagogy underpinning the use of technology? What is the role of the teacher? But that\u2019s not it. In the midst of the pandemic, how teachers can adapt? Should they simply move away from their lectern, turn on the camera and talk? Or should they embrace the upheaval to reinvent their role? If so, how can they do that? But to adapt to a world changing because of permanent imminent disruption or because of a pandemic also requires creativity. That\u2019s why we can say that teaching is both a science and an art. In other words, teaching is not only about delivering content. So how do we run a lesson so the acquisition of content becomes transmogrified into knowledge? The answers to all these questions lie in Diana Laurillard\u2019s work: teachers are like engineers who try to make the world a better place using science to design their teaching. And to do that, we have both a tool and a framework: the learning design. Edited version: Schools will become more technological, more computerised, more data driven, more automated, more individualised, so we\u2019re told. However, the inevitability of teaching shaped by machines must not make us forget these questions: what is the pedagogy underpinning the use of technology? What is the role of the teacher?

Or should they embrace the opportunity to reinvent their role? If so, how can they do that? To adapt to a world changing because of permanent imminent disruption or because of a pandemic also requires creativity. We can say that teaching is both a science and an art \u2013 like a kind of design science. In other words, teaching is not only about delivering content, but also about discovering how best to help our students learn. So how do we run a lesson so the acquisition of content becomes transformed into usable knowledge? The answers to all these questions lie in Diana Laurillard\u2019s work: teachers are like engineers who try to make the world a better place using teaching as a design science to develop their teaching. To do that, at UCL they have both a framework to represent the teaching-learning process, and a tool to turn that theory into teaching practice. Professor Laurillard will introduce both. To prepare for the session, please enrol in this online course (it is free), and watch the first video in Step 1.2 (5 mins), and register on the Learning Designer platform (it just requires an email address).

Apr\u00e8s tout, il est \u00e9vident que certainement peu de monde a envie d\u2019abandonner son traitement de texte favori. J\u2019imagine que Word a de nombreux fervents. Les utilisateurs de Mac ou d\u2019iPad trouveront dans Pages un joli traitement de texte permettant m\u00eame de faire des livres num\u00e9riques. Les fans de Google verront dans Google Docs l\u2019app collaborative par excellence que l\u2019on peut enrichir de merveilleuses extensions. Alors pourquoi ? Encore une fois la r\u00e9ponse n\u2019est pas \u00e9vidente, car je peux imaginer que de nombreux personnes consid\u00e8rent qu\u2019un logiciel WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) est aujourd\u2019hui la norme et est indispensable. C\u2019est tellement pratique ! On \u00e9crit et ce qu\u2019on obtient est absolument similaire \u00e0 ce qu\u2019on a \u00e9crit, et cela s\u00e9duit imm\u00e9diatement l\u2019\u0153il quand un traitement de texte recourant au Markdown n\u00e9cessite un format de sortie. C\u2019est une sorte de code (un format d\u2019entr\u00e9e) qui n\u00e9cessitera un format de sortie (de publication si vous pr\u00e9f\u00e9rez). En effet, si vous \u00e9crivez en Markdown, ce que vous voyez n\u2019est pas ce que vous aurez : vous \u00e9crivez, et votre travail sera ensuite export\u00e9 dans l\u2019un des formats de votre choix : rtf, txt, md, docx, PDF, HTML, ePub... Une premi\u00e8re r\u00e9ponse \u29eb Vous vous direz que vous avez l\u00e0 un premier \u00e9l\u00e9ment de r\u00e9ponse : la grande vari\u00e9t\u00e9 de formats possibles . Mais, pour moi, les premiers \u00e9l\u00e9ments de la liste sont les plus importants. En effet, je fuis d\u00e9sormais comme la peste les applications vous enfermant dans un format propri\u00e9taire dont la dur\u00e9e de vie peut atteindre un terme pr\u00e9matur\u00e9 quand une entreprise d\u00e9cide que le logiciel sur lequel vous aviez fond\u00e9 tous vos espoirs n\u2019est pas financi\u00e8rement profitable. Par ailleurs, si vous d\u00e9cidez de migrer et qu\u2019un jour vous en avez assez du Mac ou de votre PC, vous envisagerez la portabilit\u00e9 de vos donn\u00e9es avec r\u00e9confort sinon avec joie. C\u2019est pour cette raison que lorsque je vois des enseignants b\u00e2tir leurs s\u00e9quences enti\u00e8res pour telle ou telle plateforme, je me dis que cela n\u2019est pas prudent. Par exemple si vous cr\u00e9ez pendant trois ans des cours pour le TBI Promethean et que vous r\u00e9alisez (en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral bien tardivement) que l\u2019\u00e9tablissement pour lequel vous avez obtenu votre mutation utilise SmartTech, vous allez avoir pas mal de travail de sauvegarde et d\u2019adaptation. Je suis pass\u00e9 par l\u00e0 et la faute incombe aux nombreux logiciels auxquels j\u2019ai confi\u00e9 mes cours : Works, Word, LibreOffice, Pages, Google Docs, etc. Pour moi, la solution la plus simple est donc alors d\u2019\u00e9crire d\u2019abord mes cours sur un traitement de texte comme iA Writer puis d\u2019exporter mon cours dans le format de mon choix (choix fait en fonction de l\u2019\u00e9tablissement dans lequel je me trouve). En l\u2019occurrence, comme nous utilisons massivement la G-Suite, mes cours arrivent sur Google Docs ou au format PDF dans Classroom. Mais je ne veux absolument pas me poser la question du transfert de mes donn\u00e9es si un jour (improbable) on abandonne la G-Suite ou si je quitte l\u2019\u00e9tablissement. Or le format txt ou md autorise cette portabilit\u00e9 des donn\u00e9es . Par ailleurs le format texte brut ( plain text en anglais) est p\u00e9renne. Aucune inqui\u00e9tude. Il ne d\u00e9pend pas du bon vouloir d\u2019Apple ou de Microsoft. Le format texte brut est indestructible . Ajoutons enfin qu\u2019une application comme Pandoc fait du Markdown un format particuli\u00e8rement \u00ab versatile \u00bb et exportable en \u00e0 peu pr\u00e8s tout ce que vous souhaitez (voir, \u00e0 ce propos, la page Liens ). Enfin, \u00e7a n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 pour moi le moindre \u00e9tonnement de d\u00e9couvrir que je pouvais \u00ab pr\u00e9senter \u00bb, avec HackMD, mon texte comme je le ferai avec Keynote ou PowerPoint. Au prix de quelques petites adaptations, des portions de texte se transforment en diapositives (\u00ab slides \u00bb en anglais) Voici deux exemples : 20 tips to learn how to better read and write with the iPad 30 Useful Apps To Teach Online Les mains sur le clavier \u29eb Il y a un autre point qui me plait beaucoup dans le Markdown, c\u2019est la possibilit\u00e9 de se concentrer sur l\u2019\u00e9criture, les deux mains sur le clavier . J\u2019ai toujours d\u00e9test\u00e9 l\u00e2cher le clavier, parcourir l\u2019\u00e9cran pour chercher un menu, puis parfois un sous-menu afin de trouver le r\u00e9glage n\u00e9cessaire au formatage du texte. Avec le Markdown, tout est fait au clavier en ins\u00e9rant des balises ou des signes simples : mettre en gras se fait au clavier, cr\u00e9er un lien se fait au clavier, une liste \u00e0 puces se fait au clavier, etc. C\u2019est pourquoi j\u2019adore les raccourcis clavier en particulier ceux qui me permettent de me \u00ab balader \u00bb n\u2019importe o\u00f9 sur la page sans avoir \u00e0 \u00ab caresser \u00bb mon trackpad sur des kilom\u00e8tres. Aller du d\u00e9but \u00e0 la fin de la ligne (et vice versa) : \u2318 + \u279d Aller au d\u00e9but ou \u00e0 la fin d\u2019un mot : \u2325 + \u279d S\u00e9lectionner lettre par lettre : \u21e7 + \u279d S\u00e9lectionner mot par mot : \u21e7 + \u2325 + \u279d S\u00e9lectionner toute la ligne : \u2318 + \u21e7 + \u279d ou s\u00e9lectionner \u00e0 partir du curseur du d\u00e9but du texte : \u2318 + \u21e7 + \u2191 ou vers la fin : \u2318 + \u21e7 + \u2193 La possibilit\u00e9 d\u2019automatiser \u29eb Les traitements de texte reposant sur le Markdown ont une grande flexibilit\u00e9 en ce qui concerne l\u2019automatisation. Si vous \u00eates arriv\u00e9 sur cette page, vous avez probablement vu ou lu les articles suivants : Apprendre le Markdown Le guide du Markdown Markdown et automatisation Dans le dernier article, j\u2019\u00e9voque Shorcuts sur iOS et iPad OS, mais aussi Automator sur Mac et notamment cette s\u00e9rie de scripts : Avec les Markdown Service Tools , vous pouvez choisir certains scripts pour r\u00e9aliser rapidement diff\u00e9rentes manipulations tr\u00e8s vite. Ainsi, imaginons que vous souhaitiez s\u00e9lectionner pour vos \u00e9l\u00e8ves une dizaine de sites web dans Safari et constituer une liste contenant le nom du site et le lien aff\u00e9rent. En lan\u00e7ant le script md - Links - Safari Tabs dans TextEdit, vous obtiendrez automatiquement cette liste en un seul clic. Mais si l\u2019\u00e9criture de script n\u2019est pas votre truc (et pour \u00eatre honn\u00eate, \u00e7a n\u2019est pas tout \u00e0 fait le mien), il existe de nombreux services tout pr\u00eats \u00e0 l\u2019emploi pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment comme les susmentionn\u00e9s Markdown Service Tools, mais aussi des sites qui vous proposent de convertir votre texte en Mardown. Ainsi, je l\u2019ai mentionn\u00e9 plus haut, avec Pandoc , vous pouvez convertir votre article \u00e9crit en Markdown en HTLM 5 pour votre blog ou en Wikicode si vous pr\u00e9voyez de la partager sur un wiki. Cr\u00e9ez vos propres templates \u29eb G\u00e9n\u00e9ralement, quand vous utilisez un traitement de texte, vous disposez de \u00ab templates \u00bb c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire de mod\u00e8les propos\u00e9s par l\u2019\u00e9diteur du logiciel. Mais vous pouvez cr\u00e9er les v\u00f4tres. Avec certains \u00e9diteurs de texte, vous pouvez \u00e9diter la feuille de style ( CSS ) et b\u00e2tir votre propre mod\u00e8le. C\u2019est une fonction que j\u2019utilise assez peu, car sur iPad les applications le permettant sont assez rares (il y a toutefois Editorial ). Sur Mac, il y a Ulysses ou Marked qui proposent d\u2019ailleurs tous deux des galeries de mod\u00e8les \u00e0 t\u00e9l\u00e9charger. Mais pensez bien qu\u2019en \u00e9ditant le CSS, vous pouvez composer votre mod\u00e8le dans les moindres d\u00e9tails ou m\u00eame conformer vos textes au graphisme de votre site, ce qui est plut\u00f4t pratique. Vous pouvez alors avoir un mode sombre ou avoir un affichage qui s\u2019adapte \u00e0 la taille de l\u2019\u00e9cran, toute la palette des couleurs qu\u2019offre le code hexad\u00e9cimal, bref, tout ce qu\u2019on fait avec le CSS. Pour r\u00e9sumer, je trouve que je travaille plus vite depuis que j\u2019utilise le Markdown. Traitement de texte l\u00e9ger, format portable, mains solidement pos\u00e9es sur le clavier, automatisation des t\u00e2ches, possibilit\u00e9 de cr\u00e9er ses propres templates... C\u2019est un bonheur d\u2019\u00e9crivain (ou d\u2019\u00e9crivant en ce qui me concerne). Le web s\u00e9mantique \u29eb Il existe une autre raison qui n\u2019est pas sp\u00e9cifiquement inh\u00e9rente au Markdown, mais qui lui est quand m\u00eame fortement consubstantielle. Le Markdown ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 con\u00e7u comme un format de texte pour construire des documents structur\u00e9s ensuite convertis en HTML, il est, je crois, impossible, d\u2019\u00e9crire un texte en Markdown sans que celui n\u2019ait une forte structure qui tient, entre autres, \u00e0 l\u2019utilisation des titres qui sont hi\u00e9rarchis\u00e9s. Je vous explique. De nombreuses personnes \u00e9crivent un document, placent un titre, le mettent en gras et grossissent la police. On pourrait en fait dire que ceci n\u2019est pas un titre. C\u2019est du texte (le corps) qui fait office de titre, mais ce n\u2019est pas un titre. Pas un vrai en tout cas. M\u00eame chose avec les sous-titres : un peu de gras, on saute une ligne, etc. \u00c7a ressemble \u00e0 un sous-titre, mais \u00e7a n\u2019en est pas un. Pour que \u00e7a en soit, il faudrait aller faire un tour dans les styles et appliquer le style idoine (et c\u2019est bien pratique. C\u2019est m\u00eame \u00e7a qui vous cr\u00e9ent de facto une table des mati\u00e8res). Que ce soit en Markdown ou en HTML, les titres et les sous-titres pr\u00e9sentent des diff\u00e9rences. Le titre principal est pr\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9 d\u2019un # (en Markdown) ou encadr\u00e9 par les balises <h1></h1> . Un titre de niveau 2 aura ## en Markdown ou <h2></h2> en HTML, etc. \u00c7a va jusqu\u2019\u00e0 6. Quelle diff\u00e9rence ? \u00c9norme. Un document structur\u00e9 ainsi est dit s\u00e9mantique. Il signifie quelque chose \u2014 et pas seulement pour le cr\u00e9ateur du document \u2014, non, il signifie quelque chose pour le moteur de recherche de Google qui saura indexer correctement votre travail en identifiant le titre principal et ce qui est secondaire ou ce qui se trouve \u00eatre un paragraphe. Imaginez bien que les machines de Google n\u2019ont aucune id\u00e9e que l\u2019inf\u00e2me truc qui tr\u00f4ne en haut du document en police 76 de couleur fuchsia est un titre. Seule un document structur\u00e9 sera en mesure d\u2019\u00eatre signifiant pour un robot. Si vous n\u2019\u00eates pas convaincu, sachez que tout le monde ne \u00ab lit \u00bb pas le web. Certains l\u2019\u00e9coutent et ceux qui ne peuvent alors b\u00e9n\u00e9ficier d\u2019un p\u00e9riph\u00e9rique d\u2019affichage mais recourent \u00e0 des syst\u00e8mes auditifs vous seront reconnaissants. La reconnaissance vocale est d\u2019ailleurs ainsi bien meilleure. En tout cas, tout le monde sera satisfait. Les personnes mal voyantes comme le chercheur qui glanent des informations sur le web. Vers un travail collaboratif \u29eb Si c\u2019\u00e9tait tout, ce serait d\u00e9j\u00e0 pas mal, mais ce serait probablement peu convaincant ou en tout cas pas suffisant pour vous faire adopter le Markdown. Alors, disons-le d\u2019embl\u00e9e, ce qui me s\u00e9duit aujourd\u2019hui dans le choix du Markdown est la possibilit\u00e9 de synchroniser mes cours sur GitHub et de rendre mon travail collaboratif. Pour \u00eatre tout \u00e0 fait honn\u00eate, la lecture de l\u2019article de MacStories, My Markdown Writing and Collaboration Workflow, Powered by Working Copy 3.6, iCloud Drive, and GitHub , a \u00e9t\u00e9 pour moi une v\u00e9ritable r\u00e9v\u00e9lation. J\u2019imagine que j\u2019aurais pu d\u00e9couvrir tout cela plus t\u00f4t notamment \u00e0 travers cet autre article du m\u00eame auteur . Mais il m\u2019a fallu aussi un peu de temps pour assimiler tout cela. Reprenons depuis le d\u00e9but. La mort de mon disque dur \u29eb Je pense que tout a commenc\u00e9 avec la mort de mon disque dur externe ou disons du dernier disque dur que j\u2019ai achet\u00e9. Il semble que ces choses-l\u00e0 sont fragiles et j\u2019ai d\u00e9cid\u00e9, il y a bien dix ans maintenant au moins, de n\u2019en plus acheter. Jamais.

Apr\u00e8s tout, il est \u00e9vident que certainement peu de monde a envie d\u2019abandonner son traitement de texte favori. J\u2019imagine que Word a de nombreux fervents. Les utilisateurs de Mac ou d\u2019iPad trouveront dans Pages un joli traitement de texte permettant m\u00eame de faire des livres num\u00e9riques. Les fans de Google verront dans Google Docs l\u2019app collaborative par excellence que l\u2019on peut enrichir de merveilleuses extensions. Alors pourquoi ? Encore une fois la r\u00e9ponse n\u2019est pas \u00e9vidente, car je peux imaginer que de nombreux personnes consid\u00e8rent qu\u2019un logiciel WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) est aujourd\u2019hui la norme et est indispensable. C\u2019est tellement pratique ! On \u00e9crit et ce qu\u2019on obtient est absolument similaire \u00e0 ce qu\u2019on a \u00e9crit, et cela s\u00e9duit imm\u00e9diatement l\u2019\u0153il quand un traitement de texte recourant au Markdown n\u00e9cessite un format de sortie. C\u2019est une sorte de code (un format d\u2019entr\u00e9e) qui n\u00e9cessitera un format de sortie (de publication si vous pr\u00e9f\u00e9rez). En effet, si vous \u00e9crivez en Markdown, ce que vous voyez n\u2019est pas ce que vous aurez : vous \u00e9crivez, et votre travail sera ensuite export\u00e9 dans l\u2019un des formats de votre choix : rtf, txt, md, docx, PDF, HTML, ePub...","title":"Une r\u00e9ponse pas si \u00e9vidente"},{"location":"Documentation/Markdown/Pourquoi%20%C3%A9crire%20en%20Markdown/#une-premiere-reponse","text":"Vous vous direz que vous avez l\u00e0 un premier \u00e9l\u00e9ment de r\u00e9ponse : la grande vari\u00e9t\u00e9 de formats possibles . Mais, pour moi, les premiers \u00e9l\u00e9ments de la liste sont les plus importants. En effet, je fuis d\u00e9sormais comme la peste les applications vous enfermant dans un format propri\u00e9taire dont la dur\u00e9e de vie peut atteindre un terme pr\u00e9matur\u00e9 quand une entreprise d\u00e9cide que le logiciel sur lequel vous aviez fond\u00e9 tous vos espoirs n\u2019est pas financi\u00e8rement profitable. Par ailleurs, si vous d\u00e9cidez de migrer et qu\u2019un jour vous en avez assez du Mac ou de votre PC, vous envisagerez la portabilit\u00e9 de vos donn\u00e9es avec r\u00e9confort sinon avec joie. C\u2019est pour cette raison que lorsque je vois des enseignants b\u00e2tir leurs s\u00e9quences enti\u00e8res pour telle ou telle plateforme, je me dis que cela n\u2019est pas prudent. Par exemple si vous cr\u00e9ez pendant trois ans des cours pour le TBI Promethean et que vous r\u00e9alisez (en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral bien tardivement) que l\u2019\u00e9tablissement pour lequel vous avez obtenu votre mutation utilise SmartTech, vous allez avoir pas mal de travail de sauvegarde et d\u2019adaptation. Je suis pass\u00e9 par l\u00e0 et la faute incombe aux nombreux logiciels auxquels j\u2019ai confi\u00e9 mes cours : Works, Word, LibreOffice, Pages, Google Docs, etc. Pour moi, la solution la plus simple est donc alors d\u2019\u00e9crire d\u2019abord mes cours sur un traitement de texte comme iA Writer puis d\u2019exporter mon cours dans le format de mon choix (choix fait en fonction de l\u2019\u00e9tablissement dans lequel je me trouve). En l\u2019occurrence, comme nous utilisons massivement la G-Suite, mes cours arrivent sur Google Docs ou au format PDF dans Classroom. Mais je ne veux absolument pas me poser la question du transfert de mes donn\u00e9es si un jour (improbable) on abandonne la G-Suite ou si je quitte l\u2019\u00e9tablissement. Or le format txt ou md autorise cette portabilit\u00e9 des donn\u00e9es . Par ailleurs le format texte brut ( plain text en anglais) est p\u00e9renne. Aucune inqui\u00e9tude. Il ne d\u00e9pend pas du bon vouloir d\u2019Apple ou de Microsoft. Le format texte brut est indestructible . Ajoutons enfin qu\u2019une application comme Pandoc fait du Markdown un format particuli\u00e8rement \u00ab versatile \u00bb et exportable en \u00e0 peu pr\u00e8s tout ce que vous souhaitez (voir, \u00e0 ce propos, la page Liens ).

Le Markdown ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 con\u00e7u comme un format de texte pour construire des documents structur\u00e9s ensuite convertis en HTML, il est, je crois, impossible, d\u2019\u00e9crire un texte en Markdown sans que celui n\u2019ait une forte structure qui tient, entre autres, \u00e0 l\u2019utilisation des titres qui sont hi\u00e9rarchis\u00e9s. Je vous explique. De nombreuses personnes \u00e9crivent un document, placent un titre, le mettent en gras et grossissent la police. On pourrait en fait dire que ceci n\u2019est pas un titre. C\u2019est du texte (le corps) qui fait office de titre, mais ce n\u2019est pas un titre. Pas un vrai en tout cas. M\u00eame chose avec les sous-titres : un peu de gras, on saute une ligne, etc. \u00c7a ressemble \u00e0 un sous-titre, mais \u00e7a n\u2019en est pas un. Pour que \u00e7a en soit, il faudrait aller faire un tour dans les styles et appliquer le style idoine (et c\u2019est bien pratique. C\u2019est m\u00eame \u00e7a qui vous cr\u00e9ent de facto une table des mati\u00e8res). Que ce soit en Markdown ou en HTML, les titres et les sous-titres pr\u00e9sentent des diff\u00e9rences. Le titre principal est pr\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9 d\u2019un # (en Markdown) ou encadr\u00e9 par les balises <h1></h1> . Un titre de niveau 2 aura ## en Markdown ou <h2></h2> en HTML, etc. \u00c7a va jusqu\u2019\u00e0 6. Quelle diff\u00e9rence ? \u00c9norme. Un document structur\u00e9 ainsi est dit s\u00e9mantique. Il signifie quelque chose \u2014 et pas seulement pour le cr\u00e9ateur du document \u2014, non, il signifie quelque chose pour le moteur de recherche de Google qui saura indexer correctement votre travail en identifiant le titre principal et ce qui est secondaire ou ce qui se trouve \u00eatre un paragraphe. Imaginez bien que les machines de Google n\u2019ont aucune id\u00e9e que l\u2019inf\u00e2me truc qui tr\u00f4ne en haut du document en police 76 de couleur fuchsia est un titre. Seule un document structur\u00e9 sera en mesure d\u2019\u00eatre signifiant pour un robot. Si vous n\u2019\u00eates pas convaincu, sachez que tout le monde ne \u00ab lit \u00bb pas le web.

He published 50 books and over 600 articles thanks to his Zettelkasten method. A Zettelkasten is a personal tool for thinking and writing. It has /hypertextual/ features to make /a web of thought/ possible. The difference to other systems is that you create a web of thoughts instead of notes of arbitrary size and form, and /emphasize connection, not a collection/. Luhmann\u2019s Zettelkasten is a collection of notes on paper slips with a special twist: It is a hypertext that he could navigate the drawer cabinet containing all the paper slips with a reasonable amount of time and energy. We can improve ordinary note-taking methods in several ways: We can improve the connectivity of our thoughts. The hyper-textual nature of the Zettelkasten enables us to connect ideas. These connections make new insights possible. Insights don\u2019t happen in a vacuum. They are the result of making new ( unexpected ) connections. We can be more productive. The Zettelkasten Method streamlines our workflow by giving clear guidelines on what to do. This, in turn, decreases friction. It is quite common to enter a stage of flow which further increases productivity. I even allocate two days per week to make Zettelkasten work my priority and allow Zettelkasten flow to happen. We stop wasting our efforts. Even if you don\u2019t use any of your notes for a project you\u2019re working on at the moment, you prepare the knowledge for future projects. At the very least, you improve the depth of processing information from that topic. We can tackle more complex problems. It is very difficult to keep all the balls in the air if you juggle complex problems. The Zettelkasten Method allows you to concentrate on a small part of the problem and after that take a step back and look at it with a panorama vision. Normal note-taking will create a bloated mess over time. The Zettelkasten on the other hand will scale itself automatically to the size of the problem you are tackling. This is what Luhmann talked about when he wrote about \u201cinternal growth\u201d (I translated it into \u201corganic growth\u201d) in his manual . The Zettelkasten Method will make your writing easier, more coherent, smoother and more convincing. One of the main problems in writing and thinking is our limited capacity to follow one line of thought for a long period of time. Just think of meditation. It is even difficult to focus on a simple thing like breathing for a couple of minutes. Imagine how difficult it is to think about one issue for weeks and months to write a thesis. The Zettelkasten will hold your thoughts alive and help you to hold onto them. We have to make notes to wrestle with problems effectively. To put it in Luhmann\u2019s words : What are we to do with what we have written down? Certainly, at first, we will produce mostly garbage. But we have been educated to expect something useful from our activities and soon lose confidence if nothing useful seems to result. We should, therefore, reflect on whether and how we arrange our notes so that they are available for later access. How does it work? \u29eb If you want to refer to an individual note, it needs to have a fixed and unique address by which you can identify the note. It is necessary to make the actual lookup possible. [...] When you deal with a bunch of paper notes, however, you need to make it possible and bearable to get anywhere at all. Luhmann\u2019s approach was a clever numbering system. The very first note is assigned the number 1. If you add a second note that is not related to the first note, it is assigned the number 2. But if you want to continue the first note, or inject something into its content, comment on it, or something along those lines, you branch off. That new note would get assigned the number 1a. If you continue with this new note, you would go on with 1b. If you then want to comment on the note 1a, you would create a note with the address 1a1. So, in short, whenever you continue a train of thought, you increment the last position in the address, be it number or a character from the alphabet. And when you want to expand, intersperse, or comment on a note, you take its address and append a new character. For this to work, you alternate numbers and characters. Luhmann\u2019s numbering system has two consequences for re-creating his method: It makes organic growth possible. Luhmann didn\u2019t use the term /hypertext/, but he probably would if he lived today. ::This organic growth is also precisely how wikis and their wiki-link feature works. You have a text but want to expand on a point. You /branch off/ from the current page, and thus basically inject another text into the current one, but at the same time hide its contents.:: It makes linking possible. The emphasis on linking is a more obvious hint at the hyper-textual nature of his Zettelkasten. The non-linear link structure is the main trait of a hypertext. In his manual on how to create a Zettelkasten, he wrote: It is not important where you place a new note as long as you can link to it. [...] At this stage, we have a surfable hypertext. But we do not have something like a search engine to enter the hypertext. \u201cWhere to start?\u201d is a question Luhmann needed to answer. He used his register as the place to start, his entry point. Luhmann\u2019s register could be mistaken for a tag system. However, the individual notes were not tagged, nor did he put a tagging system in place to organise his Zettelkasten. There are very few IDs per item in his register, sometimes just a single one, next to each term. His register is purely a list of entry points, not a tag list. The fixed address of each note is the alpha and omega of the world of Zettelkasten. Everything becomes possible because of it.","title":"Prendre des notes"},{"location":"Documentation/Markdown/Prendre%20des%20notes/#note-taking-podcast","text":"Lien This week, Federico and John continue their mini-series focused on breaking down and rethinking the core workflows behind MacStories by tackling note-taking and their adoption of Craft for personal and collaborative notes.

L\u2019export est g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement assez riche : txt, PDF, Docs, HTML, ePub, etc. Introduction \u29eb Markdown est un langage de balisage l\u00e9ger cr\u00e9\u00e9 en 2004 par John Gruber avec l'aide d'Aaron Swartz. Son but est d'offrir une syntaxe facile \u00e0 lire et \u00e0 \u00e9crire. Un document balis\u00e9 par Markdown peut \u00eatre lu en l'\u00e9tat sans donner l\u2019impression d'avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 balis\u00e9 ou format\u00e9 par des instructions particuli\u00e8res. Wikip\u00e9dia Vous connaissez peut-\u00eatre d\u2019autres langages de balisage comme le HTML ou la syntaxe wiki. Ces \u00ab langages \u00bb consistent simplement \u00e0 ins\u00e9rer des balises afin de mettre en forme le texte propos\u00e9 \u00e0 la lecture. Par exemple, en HTML, afin de mettre un mot en gras, on peut utiliser les balises <b>Mot en gras</b> pour indiquer que l\u2019on veut que le mot soit affich\u00e9 en gras. Sur un wiki, on met des apostrophes au nombre de trois de part et d'autre du mot. Ainsi si vous \u00e9crivez '''Mot en gras''' , cela donnera Mot en gras . Le probl\u00e8me avec certaines balises, c\u2019est que cela rend le texte peu lisible. Or, comme le dit John Gruber : HTML is a publishing format ; Markdown is a writing format. Il s\u2019agit donc d\u2019\u00e9crire facilement et lisiblement en vue de publier sur le web (de tr\u00e8s nombreuses applications recourent au Markdown : Wordpress , Trello , Reddit , Tumblr , Day One Journal , Discord , Bear , etc.) De fait, si, par exemple, j\u2019\u00e9cris en HTML \u00ab Le Markdown , c\u2019est vraiment pratique ! \u00bb, je vais obtenir ceci : <p>Le <a href=\"https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown\" title=\"Markdown\">Markdown</a>, c\u2019est vraiment <em>pratique</em> !</p> Mais en Markdown, cela donnerait ceci : Le [Markdown](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown), c\u2019est vraiment *pratique* ! On remarque que c\u2019est plus \u00e9pur\u00e9, c\u2019est plus lisible en somme et que l\u2019on fait tout en une seule \u00e9tape. L\u2019\u00e9criture et la mise en forme. Votre WordPress \u2014 si vous l\u2019utilisez \u2014 saura afficher tout \u00e7a comme si c\u2019\u00e9tait du HTML. Il y a l\u00e0 un gain de temps appr\u00e9ciable. Si vous souhaitez obtenir davantage d\u2019informations sur l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat du Markdown, je vous renvoie \u00e0 l\u2019article Pourquoi \u00e9crire en Markdown . Si vous voulez directement acc\u00e9der au document pr\u00e9sentant la syntaxe du Markdown sans autres explications, je vous renvoie \u00e0 l\u2019article Le guide du Markdown . Connaissances de bases \u00e0 acqu\u00e9rir \u29eb Faire un paragraphe \u29eb Pour aller \u00e0 la ligne, appuyez simplement sur la touche \u21b5 . Si vous souhaitez forcer le retour \u00e0 la ligne, ins\u00e9rez la balise <br /> . Les titres \u29eb Comme en HTML, il y a des titres de plusieurs niveaux (1 \u00e0 6). On utilise le signe # pour ce faire. # Titre de niveau 1 ## Titre de niveau 2 ### Titre de niveau 3 #### Titre de niveau 4 ##### Titre de niveau 5 ###### Titre de niveau 6 Rappelons que mettre des titres de cette fa\u00e7on permet de construire dans certains documents la table des mati\u00e8res. Mettre en gras, en italique, surligner ou rayer un mot \u29eb Pour mettre un mot en italique, placez ce mot entre deux ast\u00e9risques * : Ce mot est en *italique* . Pour mettre un mot en gras, places-le entre deux ast\u00e9risques ** : Ce mot est en **gras** . Pour surligner un mot, placez deux signes \u00e9gal de part et d\u2019autre : Ce mot est ==surlign\u00e9==. Pour barrer un mot, encadrez-le d\u2019un double tilde ~~ : Ce mot est ~~barr\u00e9~~ . Ins\u00e9rer une note de bas de page \u29eb Placez [^1] juste apr\u00e8s le mot \u00e0 la suite duquel vous souhaitez ins\u00e9rez une note de bas de page.

Son but est d'offrir une syntaxe facile \u00e0 lire et \u00e0 \u00e9crire. Un document balis\u00e9 par Markdown peut \u00eatre lu en l'\u00e9tat sans donner l\u2019impression d'avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 balis\u00e9 ou format\u00e9 par des instructions particuli\u00e8res. Wikip\u00e9dia Vous connaissez peut-\u00eatre d\u2019autres langages de balisage comme le HTML ou la syntaxe wiki. Ces \u00ab langages \u00bb consistent simplement \u00e0 ins\u00e9rer des balises afin de mettre en forme le texte propos\u00e9 \u00e0 la lecture. Par exemple, en HTML, afin de mettre un mot en gras, on peut utiliser les balises <b>Mot en gras</b> pour indiquer que l\u2019on veut que le mot soit affich\u00e9 en gras. Sur un wiki, on met des apostrophes au nombre de trois de part et d'autre du mot. Ainsi si vous \u00e9crivez '''Mot en gras''' , cela donnera Mot en gras . Le probl\u00e8me avec certaines balises, c\u2019est que cela rend le texte peu lisible. Or, comme le dit John Gruber : HTML is a publishing format ; Markdown is a writing format. Il s\u2019agit donc d\u2019\u00e9crire facilement et lisiblement en vue de publier sur le web (de tr\u00e8s nombreuses applications recourent au Markdown : Wordpress , Trello , Reddit , Tumblr , Day One Journal , Discord , Bear , etc.) De fait, si, par exemple, j\u2019\u00e9cris en HTML \u00ab Le Markdown , c\u2019est vraiment pratique ! \u00bb, je vais obtenir ceci : <p>Le <a href=\"https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown\" title=\"Markdown\">Markdown</a>, c\u2019est vraiment <em>pratique</em> !</p> Mais en Markdown, cela donnerait ceci : Le [Markdown](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown), c\u2019est vraiment *pratique* ! On remarque que c\u2019est plus \u00e9pur\u00e9, c\u2019est plus lisible en somme et que l\u2019on fait tout en une seule \u00e9tape. L\u2019\u00e9criture et la mise en forme. Votre WordPress \u2014 si vous l\u2019utilisez \u2014 saura afficher tout \u00e7a comme si c\u2019\u00e9tait du HTML. Il y a l\u00e0 un gain de temps appr\u00e9ciable. Si vous souhaitez obtenir davantage d\u2019informations sur l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat du Markdown, je vous renvoie \u00e0 l\u2019article Pourquoi \u00e9crire en Markdown .

Mais dans ma conclusion, je savais qu'il me restait beaucoup de choses \u00e0 d\u00e9couvrir et \u00e9crivais donc : Comme je l'ai dit en d\u00e9but d'article, je suis probablement, forc\u00e9ment pass\u00e9 \u00e0 c\u00f4t\u00e9 de beaucoup, beaucoup de choses. [...] Mais cette impression permanente d'avoir \u00e0 d\u00e9couvrir une vaste terra incognita est un vrai plaisir dans l'utilisation quotidienne d'Obsidian. On sait qu'on a toujours un truc \u00e0 explorer. Je ne m'\u00e9tais pas tromp\u00e9. Je continue \u00e0 explorer inlassablement Obsidian sans m'en lasser et m\u00eame ce que je connaissais d\u00e9j\u00e0 parvient \u00e0 un \u00e9tat de raffinement nouveau et progressif qui me laisse pantois. Par exemple, les raccourcis clavier (hotkeys) sont, pardon pour l'\u00e9vidence, un incroyable moyen d'acc\u00e9l\u00e9rer son travail. Le truc, c'est qu'il y a un raccourci pour la moindre chose. Quelques exemples : cmd + P (lancer une commande) cmd + \u21e7 + P (\u00e9pingler une page (pin)) cmd + \u21e7 + i (utiliser un template) C'est vous m\u00eame qui d\u00e9cidez (et si vous oubliez : cmd + P pour chercher...). Les iframes ne cessent de m'enchanter non plus. J'en avais d\u00e9j\u00e0 parl\u00e9 pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment \u00e9galement, mais j'avais un souci avec l'affichage des tweets. Ceux-ci ne s'affichant pas correctement, j'ai d\u00e9somaris recours \u00e0 https://twitframe.com qui m'affiche un beau tweet en bonne et due forme. Mais, \u00e9videmment, ce sont les plugins qui sont responsables en grande partie de la richesse d'Obsidian et qui justifient l'\u00e9criture de ce deuxi\u00e8me article. Voici ceux qui m'ont le plus impressionn\u00e9. Advanced tables Templates Buttons Tags pane Dataview Advanced tables \u29eb Comme vous pouvez vous en douter, ce plugin permet de cr\u00e9er des tableaux, ce qui n'est quand m\u00eame pas le fort du Markdown. Mais, comme vous vous en doutez \u00e9galement, ce plugin va consid\u00e9rablement arranger les choses. Comment l'utiliser ? \u29eb Je cite les explications trouv\u00e9es sur le compte Github du d\u00e9veloppeur. To create a table, create a single | character, then type the table's first heading and press Tab. Continue entering headings and pressing Tab until all the headings are created. Press Enter to go to the first row. Continue filling cells as before, and press Enter again for each new row. Ce qui, en fran\u00e7ais googlement traduit, donne : Pour cr\u00e9er un tableau, cr\u00e9ez un seul caract\u00e8re \u00ab | \u00bb, puis saisissez le premier titre du tableau et appuyez sur Tab. Continuez \u00e0 saisir les en-t\u00eates et appuyez sur Tab jusqu'\u00e0 ce que tous les en-t\u00eates soient cr\u00e9\u00e9s. Appuyez sur Entr\u00e9e pour acc\u00e9der \u00e0 la premi\u00e8re ligne. Continuez \u00e0 remplir les cellules comme avant et appuyez \u00e0 nouveau sur Entr\u00e9e pour chaque nouvelle ligne. Sinon, lorsque le curseur est plac\u00e9 dans le tableau, vous pouvez utiliser les raccourcis clavier suivants : Hotkey Action Tab Next Cell Shift + Tab Previous Cell Enter Next Row Cmd + Shift + D Open table controls sidebar Le plus simple est parfois encore d'utiliser la commande ( cmd + P ) et de taper \u00ab table \u00bb pour trouver ce dont on a besoin. Mais ce n'est pas tout ! Les formules \u29eb Le titre est un peu un spoiler, mais enfin, on peut avoir des formules dans son tableau comme on le ferait avec Google Sheets ou Excel. Quelques explications ici : Formulas in Markdown Tables Using Excel-like Formulas In Obsidian - Advanced Tables Plugin (vid\u00e9o bien plus pratique et rapide pour comprendre) Sinon voici ce que j'ai compris pour faire une simple addition. \u00c0 la fin du tableau, Ins\u00e9rez un commentaire HTML : <!-- --> (sans oublier les espaces) Ajoutez TBLFM: (= table formatt) : <!-- TBLFM: --> Pr\u00e9cisez la destination & la source (en fait, l\u00e0 o\u00f9 la formule sera plac\u00e9e : dernier rang, derni\u00e8re colonne) @>$2 Indiquez la formule : =sum() Donnez la premi\u00e8re rang\u00e9e : @I (=premi\u00e8re rang\u00e9e sous le titre/header) Puis la derni\u00e8re : @-1 (= derni\u00e8re rang\u00e9e) Utilisez le raccourci ( cmd + option + D ) ou la commande ( cmd + P ) et choisir evaluate formulas En pratique, \u00e7a donne \u00e7a : Chose Nombre Un 1 Deux 2 Trois 3 Total 6 On avouera que n'est quand m\u00eame pas super user friendly, mais c'est plut\u00f4t amusant (quoique j'utiliserai plut\u00f4t un tableur de pr\u00e9f\u00e9rence pour ce genre de choses). ## Templates Quand on veut s'\u00e9viter d'\u00e9crire et de r\u00e9\u00e9crire inlassablement la m\u00eame chose, on cr\u00e9e des templates. J'ai, par exemple, cr\u00e9\u00e9 un template pour r\u00e9diger le plan d'une s\u00e9quence que je donne \u00e0 mes \u00e9l\u00e8ves. Le template ins\u00e8re automatiquement les principaux titres et les tags. Ainsi, je cr\u00e9e un nouveau fichier, utilise le raccourci suivant : cmd + \u21e7 + i , choisis le template voulu et mon plan de s\u00e9quence est automatiquement ins\u00e9r\u00e9. Je n'ai plus qu'\u00e0 le remplir. \u00c0 l'avenir, jaimerais utliser les templates pour acc\u00e9l\u00e9rer l'\u00e9criture de mails pour communiquer davantage avec les parents pour signaler rapidement tout manquement, difficult\u00e9 ou autre. Bref, je sens que je vais cr\u00e9er de nombreux templates. Si vous voulez en savoir plus, voyez cette vid\u00e9o de Bryan Jenks pour comprendre comment faire (la deuxi\u00e8me partie de la vid\u00e9o parle du plugin Templater mais \u00e7a m'a paru un rien complexe.) Lisez aussi l'aide d'Obsidian . Mais, en gros, c'est relativement simple : Activez les templates dans Core plugins (dans les r\u00e9glages) Cr\u00e9ez un dossier Templates (pour stocker vos templates) Cr\u00e9ez dans ce dossier un template (en fait, un simple fichier contenant tout ce que vous souhaitez ensuite r\u00e9utiliser) Lancez votre template (par exemple, vous cr\u00e9ez un fichier et y ins\u00e9rez votre template) Buttons \u29eb Aussi surprenant cela puisse-t-il paraitre, on peut ins\u00e9rer dans une note... un bouton. Bon, apr\u00e8s tout, on savait d\u00e9j\u00e0 qu'on pouvait ins\u00e9rer un iframe ou un tableau contenant une formule comme dans un tableur. Alors pouquoi pas un bouton ? Pour ce faire, t\u00e9l\u00e9chargez le plugin Buttons . Il y a un assistant pour cr\u00e9er un bouton, mais en fait ce sont quelques lignes de codes apparaissant dans votre note et qui contiennent quelque chose comme ceci : ```button name Pin type command action Toggle pin color green ``` ^button-buttonpin En gros, on a le nom du bouton (name) le type (ce que fait le bouton) l'action effectu\u00e9e la couleur OK, mais pour quoi faire ? Eh bien j'imagine que les possibilit\u00e9s sont assez importantes (bis repetita...), mais comme vous allez le d\u00e9couvrir dans la prochaine section de cet article, j'en ai cr\u00e9\u00e9 quelques-uns sur une note que j'ai baptis\u00e9e Dashboard. En attendant, sachez que les options pour cr\u00e9er les boutons sont les suivantes : Command: Click the Button to run a Command from the Command Palette Link: Click the Button to open a URL or URI Calculate: Click the Button to run a math calculation. Calculate Buttons can reference lines from the note Template: Click the Button to prepend, append, insert, or create a new note from a template note Text: Clock the Button to prepend, append, insert, or create a new note with specified text Swap: A Swap Button is a special type of Inline Button. With a Swap Button you can run a different type of Button on each click La meilleure vid\u00e9o pour comprendre ce plugin est celle de son auteur (mais regardez les deux autres, le d\u00e9veloppeur est marrant). Une fois le plugin install\u00e9, Lancez la commande cmd + P Tapez \u00ab button \u00bb (puis s\u00e9lectionnez \u00ab Button Maker \u00bb) Cr\u00e9ez votre bouton (s\u00e9lectionnez dans le menu le type de bouton que vous voulez cr\u00e9er) Modifiez deux ou trois param\u00e8tres (comme l'apparence ou si vous voulez que le bouton disparaisse une fois qu'il a \u00e9t\u00e9 utilis\u00e9) On peut aussi choisir d'ins\u00e9rer un \u00ab inline button \u00bb (le bouton sera ins\u00e9r\u00e9 dans la ligne) et c'est tr\u00e8s \u00e9l\u00e9gant. Pour ce faire, suivez les instructions suivantes : Inline Buttons can be created inline with other text, or other Buttons. An Inline Button is essentially a copy of an existing Button codeblock placed inline. To create an inline button: 1. Create a regular Button using the Button Maker or hand-written Button codeblock 2. Ensure your Button has a unique button-block-id 3. Go to the note you want an inline Button and run the Insert Inline Button Command, or write the button-block-id between backticks: button-id Inline Buttons must start with button , whereas other usages of the button-block-id only require the id ### Dashboard Mon dashboard est une page d'accueil qui affiche toutes les tables des mati\u00e8res de chaque dossier voire sous-dossier. En utilisant ![[texte]] , on peut ins\u00e9rer le contenu d'une note dans une autre note. Ainsi, chaque table des mati\u00e8res peut \u00eatre affich\u00e9e dans la table principale et s'actualiser automatiquement. Makes sense? Le dashboard pr\u00e9sente quelques boutons (des \u00ab inline buttons \u00bb) : Pin, Edit/Preview, New Note, Search... \u00c7a permet d'effectuer certaines actions plus vite. J'y ai plac\u00e9 \u00e9galement mes tags ou encore les t\u00e2ches \u00e0 accomplir avant 2071. Tags \u29eb Tout d'abord, activez le \u00ab Core plugin \u00bb Tag pane. Comme indiqu\u00e9 dans la description du plugin : Adds a panel on the right that displays all the tags you have, along with their tag count. Et comme je trouvais plus simple de l'avoir \u00e0 gauche, je l'ai simplement fait glisser sur la gauche pour l'avoir \u00e0 c\u00f4t\u00e9 de la loupe ou de l'\u00e9toile o\u00f9 je fais mes recherches ou place les notes les plus fr\u00e9quemment utilis\u00e9es. \u00c0 propos de tags... J'ai d\u00e9couvert l'\u00e9tendue des possibilit\u00e9s induites par YAML . Pour faire tr\u00e8s court, YAML = metadata. Pour rappel, les m\u00e9tadonn\u00e9es, ce sont des donn\u00e9es sur vos donn\u00e9es. \u00c7a procure des informations sur vos donn\u00e9es. Par exemple, pour une photo, les m\u00e9tadonn\u00e9es vont vous donner la dimension, le type d'appareil, mais encore la date et l'heure, la localisation ou m\u00eame, selon le programme que vous utilisez, des informations sur les gens ou les choses apparaissant sur la photo... Les m\u00e9tadonn\u00e9es que vous allez placer dans vos notes peuvent donc \u00eatre l'auteur, la date, des tags, etc. Pour en savoir davantage sur YAML et savoir comment l'utiliser, vous pouvez aussi lire et voir ceci pour comprendre exactement de quoi il retourne si cela ne vous parle pas : YAML front matter YAML | In One Video Mieux encore, regardez An Introduction to Dataview - Part 1 . C'est une vid\u00e9o excellente pour comprendre YAML, les metadata et surtout, on va le voir ci-dessous, le plugin Dataview . Les donn\u00e9es YAML doivent \u00eatre plac\u00e9es au d\u00e9but du fichier avec --- au d\u00e9but et \u00e0 la fin. --- tags: [Documentation, Markdown] --- Entre ces --- , vous placez une \u00ab key \u00bb (par exemple \u00ab tags \u00bb) et une \u00ab value \u00bb (par exemple \u00ab Markdwon \u00bb). Pour le moment, Obsidian n'accepte que trois keys : tags , aliases et cssclass , mais \u00e7a n'a pas beaucoup d'importance parce que vous allez in\u00e9vitablement utiliser Dataview . Les avantages sont immenses, mais le premier qui m'est apparu est que mes tags n'apparaissent pas \u00e0 l'export. Ils n'encombrent pas non plus la page. Mais surtout on peut aller beaucoup plus loin avec Dataview . Dataview \u29eb Pour tout savoir ce que je ne saurais vous expliquer en quelques lignes sur Dataview, voyez An Introduction to Dataview - Part 1 An Introduction to Dataview - Part 2 Il parait, du moins si j'en crois ceux qui savent exactement de quoi il retourne, que \u00e7a ressemble \u00e0 des requ\u00eates SQL. En fait, on peut transformer ses notes en une base de donn\u00e9es dans laquelle on va pouvoir puiser all\u00e8grement. Je peux, par exemple, demander \u00e0 avoir une liste de tous les fichiers se trouvant dans tel dossier (\u00e0 condition d'appuyer sur Preview ensuite). On \u00e9crit simplement ceci : ```` list ````` Mais, \u00e9videmment, c'est l'exemple le plus simple que l'on puisse donner. On peut faire tellement plus ! On peut m\u00eame faire des tables et trier ses notes par date, auteur ou \u00ab rating \u00bb, etc. Le mieux est encore de voir cela en images. Pour cela, on va utiliser des op\u00e9rateurs comme from pour filtrer la liste et afficher par exemple un hashtag particulier. Ou lister le contenu d'un dossier (mettre des guillemets : \"Le dossier\" ). On peut utiliser op\u00e9rateur bool\u00e9en AND ou OR utiliser le signe moins -Google pour exclure certains termes de la recherche Utiliser le signe + pour concat\u00e9ner etc. Conclusion \u29eb Il n'y en aura pas (pr\u00e9t\u00e9rition). Je sais que je vais encore d\u00e9couvrir plein de choses. Je ne peux que citer la conclusion \u00e0 laquelle j'\u00e9tais parvenu dans l'article pr\u00e9c\u00e9dent et que je citais au d\u00e9but : Comme je l'ai dit en d\u00e9but d'article, je suis probablement, forc\u00e9ment pass\u00e9 \u00e0 c\u00f4t\u00e9 de beaucoup, beaucoup de choses. [...] Mais cette impression permanente d'avoir \u00e0 d\u00e9couvrir une vaste terra incognita est un vrai plaisir dans l'utilisation quotidienne d'Obsidian.

Pour ce faire, suivez les instructions suivantes : Inline Buttons can be created inline with other text, or other Buttons. An Inline Button is essentially a copy of an existing Button codeblock placed inline. To create an inline button: 1. Create a regular Button using the Button Maker or hand-written Button codeblock 2. Ensure your Button has a unique button-block-id 3. Go to the note you want an inline Button and run the Insert Inline Button Command, or write the button-block-id between backticks: button-id Inline Buttons must start with button , whereas other usages of the button-block-id only require the id ### Dashboard Mon dashboard est une page d'accueil qui affiche toutes les tables des mati\u00e8res de chaque dossier voire sous-dossier.

Les m\u00e9tadonn\u00e9es que vous allez placer dans vos notes peuvent donc \u00eatre l'auteur, la date, des tags, etc. Pour en savoir davantage sur YAML et savoir comment l'utiliser, vous pouvez aussi lire et voir ceci pour comprendre exactement de quoi il retourne si cela ne vous parle pas : YAML front matter YAML | In One Video Mieux encore, regardez An Introduction to Dataview - Part 1 .

La suite dans un troisi\u00e8me article ?","title":"Conclusion"},{"location":"Documentation/Obsidian/Obsidian%20English%20Version/","text":"Since I discovered Markdown, several applications have successively seduced me and I first adopted 1Writer and then Ulysses or Editorial . More recently iA Writer and Bear made me very happy and since I came back to the Mac, I have heard about Obsidian . It was love at first sight. Therefore it deserves a separate section in this little section devoted to Markdown ). What I would have to say here could be summed up in very few words: do not miss out on such an application. It's a marvel like I haven't seen in 10 years. However, defining what makes the strength of this app is difficult: a note taking app? A word processing? A PKM ? Some kind of IDE ? And then explaining what makes Obsidian so rich would take pages and pages, but I can at least give you an idea of its power and show what uses I have developed that were not possible with other applications I have used in the past. However, there is a good chance that these few weeks spent with Obsidian did not allow me to perceive the entirety of the possibilities which seem immense. Actually, I have the impression of having discovered a new universe, that of PKM (Personal Knowledge Management) actually. But let's try. First of all, learn that it all starts with the creation of a \u201cvault\u201d, which is never more than a folder in which you will place all your notes, all your files. You can create several, which I did (one for my lesson plans, one for my reading, one for technology, etc.). In a \"vault\", you will have an .obsidian folder in which will be nestled various things which will be discussed below such as plugins, themes or CSS files. But let's start with the beginning. Obsidian is above all Markdown. 1. Markdown \u29eb In a section dedicated to markdown , it goes without saying that this is an essential point. If the importance of keeping control of your data, not entrusting apps that are likely to lock them into an ecosystem that does not care about openness or communication with other applications is an essential feature for you, you will also appreciate that the Markdown remains (more or less) displayed as Markdown and is not subject to any adjustment whatsoever to erase its traces. Applications that I appreciate a lot like Ulysses, iA Writer or Bear tend to offer their own version of Markdown and take some liberties which I would do well without (and which I do without). 2. HTML \u29eb Obsidian is based on HTML, JavasScript and CSS. There is even a console like in a browser ( alt + cmd + i ). You therefore have the possibility of inserting HTML. Thus, you can insert various small very useful tags ( <sup> / </sup> , <br /> ...), but also, for example, a table (and everyone knows that this is not the strongest point of Markdown). Here's a much more complex one than I could not have done with Markdown alone: <table cellpadding=\"5\"> <tr> <th colspan=\"2\" rowspan=\"2\" style=\"border-style:none;\"></th> <th colspan = \"3\">Formes conjointes</th> <th rowspan=\"2\">Formes<br />disjointes</th> </tr> <tr> <td>Sujet</td> <td>Compl\u00e9ment direct</td> <td>Compl\u00e9ment indirect</td> </tr> <tr> <th rowspan=\"4\">Sing.</th> <td>1<sup>re</sup> pers.</td> <td>je</td> <td>me</td> <td>me</td> <td>moi</td> </tr> <tr> <td>2<sup>e</sup> pers.</td> <td>tu</td> <td>te</td> <td>te</td> <td>toi</td> </tr> <tr> <td>3<sup>e</sup> pers.</td> <td>il, elle</td> <td>le, la, en</td> <td>lui, en, y</td> <td>lui, elle</td> </tr> <tr> <td></td> <td></td> <td>se</td> <td>se</td> <td>soi (soi-m\u00eame)</td> </tr> <tr> <th rowspan=\"4\">Plur.</th> <td>1<sup>re</sup> pers.</td> <td>nous</td> <td>nous</td> <td>nous</td> <td>nous</td> </tr> <tr> <td>2<sup>e</sup> pers.</td> <td>vous</td> <td>vous</td> <td>vous</td> <td>vous</td> </tr> <tr> <td>3<sup>e</sup> pers.</td> <td>ils, elles</td> <td>les, leur, se</td> <td>leur, en, y, se</td> <td>eux, elles, </td> </tr> </table> But, of course, you can also insert iframes in your notes. This means that you can insert entire web pages, tweets, a list from Dynalist, a Genially, a Google Calendar or even a Pomodoro... <iframe src=\"https://pomofocus.io/\" height=\"700\" width=\"700\"></iframe> Maybe it's worth mentioning that I had a problem with displaying tweets. As they are not shown correctly, I have found Twitframe which displays a nice and proper tweet. 3. CSS Snippets \u29eb You can modify the Obsidian style sheet and adapt the display of your notes to your needs. But the stroke of genius is to allow the creation of small \"snippets\" which replace the modified elements in the main CSS. So you don't have to edit the main file, but can turn on or off certain portions of CSS on the fly. For now, I have contented myself with modifying the appearance of the tags and quotes by copying the code I found here and there. But the next time I want to offer nice documents to my students, I will be able to develop a template of my own. Anyway, it is quite simple. Just create a .css file with your favorite editor. When you are finished, place this file in the snippets folder ( .obsidian> snippets ). Check out the Meta Post - CSS Themes - Share & showcase - Obsidian Forum . You will find pretty things ready to use. 4. Themes \u29eb Not much to say. The thing is pretty self-explanatory: you can download different \"templates\". Choose the one you like. For my part, I opted for Cybertron Comfort color dark. Go to Settings> Appearance> Themes . It is very pleasant to be able to personalize your own working environment. This is, by the way, an area that I have explored very little, but Obsidian's flexibility in this matter is great. 5. Links \u29eb The ability to link notes together is the first thing that appealed to me when I discovered this kind of apps. I already had this possibility in Bear and since I got a glimpse of the Zettelkasten method, this is something that is now essential to me. These are called \"wikilinks\". I use them, among other things, to create a table of contents or to gather scattered notes (for example, all the notes that I take, say, when I read a book by Jules Verne, are thus \"connected\" a little bit like in a wiki). Just open double square brackets and type the name of the note. [[Note Mysterious Island]] We also have the possibility of aggregating these notes between them. You just have to add an exclamation point, which is handy. For example, imagine you are a French teacher and you have various scattered texts that you have studied with your students and you want to put them all together to make your exam list. No need to copy and paste everything. Just insert each note into one by inserting the links. ! [Obsidian](./Obsidian.md) Another interesting possibility: Copy Obsidian url . We get something like obsidian://open? Vault=Tech&file=Markdown%2FObsidian . That is, if I am not mistaken, some sort of x-callback-url , which should come in handy for automating some tasks. Still on the subject of links, in Preview mode, it's quite nice to have this little window for previewing the content of a link, a bit like on Wikipedia, when you hover the mouse over the link. 6. Tags \u29eb They are not specific to Obsidian, but I would be sad to do without them. As you can see above, with a little CSS, I tried to make them look better. And since I spend time linking my notes together, I also take time to tag everything so that I can better find everything that, in my life as a teacher, I have been able to produce (more on that later). Thus, the tags allow me to carry out a more detailed search to find (for instance) all the writing exercises that I have been able to propose to my students or even sort them by level or subject. Obviously, this is a work in progress, but just as I want to have documents that are portable regardless of the application I use or will be using, I make sure I can find and gather everything that is still terribly scattered. Like I said, more on that when it comes to the Dataview plugin. 7. Mind map \u29eb This is not an essential one but I like the idea of having it: you can export a text file into an image format and thus have a mind map. To get this mind map, open the command ( cmd + P ) and type \"mind map\". To export the image, click on the three small dots on the right above the mind map and click on \"Copy screenshot\". 8. Graph View \u29eb This Graph View is perhaps the prettiest thing I have seen. It is like a starry sky or rather a constellation which allows you to see a graphic representation of your notes. All those that are connected together are linked by a line. Those with the most references are bigger. These dots are all clickable and allow you to navigate easily through this labyrinth made up of your notes. Everything is editable. You can change the CSS. You can filter or only show certain things (orphan notes, images or other documents, etc.). That is wonderful. ![[graph-view.gif]] 9. Plugins \u29eb Last but not least, plugins. You will tell me, the \"graph view\" is a plugin (like the mind map for that matter), but it is a plugin that is part of the \"Core plugins\". Among these, I also like Tag Pane or Daily Notes. As its name suggests, the latter is used to take daily notes. Basically every time you open the app, a note is created. Convenient for taking notes on the fly. It reminds me a little of Draft which, each time it is launched, opens a blank page ready to welcome the fruit of your reflections. There is another set of plugins, third party plugins, made by other developers that bring enrichment to the application that goes beyond expectation. You will find them by clicking on the small cogwheel at the bottom left corner and then heading to Community plugins . You will also need to deactivate the Safe mode (same location). You can click on any of these links to search for plugins: List of plugins ) Third party plugins For now, these are the plugins I use the more: Better Word Count Ozan's Image in Editor Plugin Kindle Plugin Readwise Text Snippets Pandoc Review Natural language Dates Editor Syntax Highlight Advanced Tables Templates Buttons Tags and Tags pane Dataview Here is, very quickly, what can be said about these plugins. Better Word Count \u29eb A very simple plugin that allows you to count the number of words on a page of course (like all counters of this type), but also by selecting a portion of text only. Very handy if you need to fill out a document with a small number of words or if you write your tweets first on Obsidian. Ozan's Image in Editor Plugin \u29eb This plugin allows you to see the images in editor mode while keeping the image link displayed. Note that there is an option in Obsidian that automatically updates this link if you move or rename this link. Kindle Plugin \u29eb Certainly, with the following plugin, the one that made me want to adopt Obsidian. You can import all the highlighted and annotated excerpts on your Kindle (with Kindle Highlights ). Super handy, because all your quotes are available in text format, so you can easily insert them into an essay or an article. It also allows you to find them more easily perhaps because the search can be filtered using tags. Do you remember that we can link notes together? You can also link a note to only a part (a block) of another note. Read Link to blocks to learn more. This allows you to insert your quote quite easily. Readwise \u29eb Obviously, I'm not only highlighting things in my Kindle. This is why I use Readwise for Kindle Highlights only works with books purchased from Amazon (although you can import the My Clippings.txt file from your Kindle), but Readwise also offers to collect pretty much anything you have highlighted and annotated: tweets, saved articles. on Instapaper, Pocket, Books, Feedly, Medium, etc. If the topic interests you, take a look at the Obsidian forum . Text Snippets \u29eb I have become an absolute fan of this stuff. Fran\u00e7ois Jourde introduced me to Text Blaze . I also knew Text Expander . I use a lot, on the iPad, iPhone or Mac, the Text Replacement function, but this is also available on Obsidian thanks to this plugin. The idea is to define a keyword (in the example below, the word \"I\") and when you activate the appropriate keyboard shortcut, it inserts a whole portion of text that has been defined in advance. This is extremely useful when you grade digital essays, for example. You define a \"snippet\" and it inserts the text automatically. Pandoc \u29eb While browsing the export possibilities, I had a feeling of disappointment. Only PDF is permitted. Fortunately, a kind developer has created a plugin to take advantage of Pandoc which I have already mentioned here . In short, you install the plugin and to summon Pandoc, run the command (use the shortcut cmd + P ) then type \u201cPandoc\u201d. At first, it didn't work. I had to change the path /usr/local/bin/pandoc in settings (after typing which pandoc in Terminal). Not sure why, but it works and I can now export to Word, odt, ePub, HTML, etc. Natural language Dates & Review \u29eb If I write @Today , it inserts today's date. Lovely, isn't it? To be used in combination with Review ( cmd + p ). For example, you select a note or a portion of text, you launch Review , choose a date and the selected text will be reminded to you on the given date. I'm not quite sure anymore, but I believe it should be used with the Calendar plugin. Editor Syntax Highlight \u29eb Probably not the plugin that will be the most useful to me, although I gladly use it to store some snippets of code that I use for my website Ralentir travaux . But I am thinking above all of my colleagues teaching computer science who will be able to insert portions of code into their courses with syntax highlighting. Advanced table \u29eb As you can imagine, this plugin allows you to create tables, which is not the strongest Markdown feature. But, as you can imagine too, this plugin is going to help considerably. How to use it? \u29eb I am quoting the explanations found on the developer's [Github account] (https://github.com/tgrosinger/advanced-tables-obsidian). To create a table, create a single | character, then type the table's first heading and press Tab. Continue entering headings and pressing Tab until all the headings are created. Press Enter to go to the first row. Continue filling cells as before, and press Enter again for each new row. When the cursor is placed in the table, you can use the following keyboard shortcuts: Hotkey Action Tab Next Cell Shift + Tab Previous Cell Enter Next Row Cmd + Shift + D Open table controls sidebar Sometimes the easiest way is still to use the command ( cmd + P ) and type \"table\" to find what you need. But that's not all! Formulas \u29eb The title is a bit of a spoiler, but you can have formulas in your table as you would with Google Sheets or Excel. Some explanations here: [Formulas in Markdown Tables] (https://github.com/tgrosinger/md-advanced-tables/blob/main/docs/formulas.md) [Using Excel-like Formulas In Obsidian - Advanced Tables Plugin] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0UxmHGoqTk) (a much more practical and faster video to understand how to insert formulas) Here is what I understood to make a simple addition. At the end of a table, Insert an HTML comment: <! - -> (without forgetting the spaces) Add TBLFM: (= table format): <! - TBLFM: -> Specify the destination & the source (in fact, where the formula will be placed: last row, last column) @>$2 Specify the formula: = sum () Give the first row: @I (= first row under the header) Then the last one: @-1 (= last row) Use the shortcut ( cmd + option + D ) or the command ( cmd + P ) and choose evaluate formulas You should get this: | Things | Number | | ------ | ------ | | One | 1 | | Two | 2 | | Three | 3 | | Total | 6 | <!-- TBLFM: @>$2=sum(@I..@-1) --> I must admit that it is not super user friendly, but it is rather fun (although I will use a spreadsheet preferably for this kind of thing). ### Templates When one wants to avoid writing and rewriting the same thing over and over again, one creates templates. For example, I created a template to write a lesson plan that I give to my students. The template automatically inserts the main titles and tags. To do that, I create a new file, use the following shortcut: cmd + \u21e7 + i , choose the desired template and my lesson plan is automatically inserted. I just have to fill it out. As a teacher, I would like to use the templates to speed up email writing to communicate more with parents to quickly report any misbehaving or problems. Anyway, I feel like I'm going to create a lot of templates. If you want to know more, [watch this video made by Bryan Jenks] (https://youtu.be/1eUxQo6Dy7k) to understand how to create templates (the second part of the video talks about the Templater plugin but it seemed a little complex to me). Also read [Obsidian help] (https://help.obsidian.md/Plugins/Templates). But, basically, it's relatively simple: Activate the templates in Core plugins (in the settings) Create a Templates folder (to store your templates) Create in this folder a template (in fact, a simple file containing everything you want to reuse) Launch your template (for example, you create a file and insert your template into it) Buttons \u29eb As surprising as it may seem, you can insert a button in a note! Well, after all, we already knew that we could insert an iframe or a table containing a formula like in a spreadsheet. So why not a button? To do this, download the [Buttons] plugin (https://github.com/shabegom/buttons). There is a wizard for creating a button, but it's actually a few lines of code appearing in your note that contain something like this: ```button name Pin type command action Toggle pin color green ``` ^button-buttonpin Basically, you have the name of the button (name) the type (what the button does) the action performed the colour OK, but what do we do with that? Well I imagine the possibilities are quite large (bis repetita ...), but as you will find out in the next section of this article, I created a few on a note that I called the dashboard. In the meantime, know that the options to create the buttons are as follows: Command: Click the Button to run a Command from the Command Palette Link: Click the Button to open a URL or URI Calculate: Click the Button to run a math calculation. Calculate Buttons can reference lines from the note Template: Click the Button to prepend, append, insert, or create a new note from a template note Text: Clock the Button to prepend, append, insert, or create a new note with specified text Swap: A Swap Button is a special type of Inline Button. With a Swap Button you can run a different type of Button on each click [The best video] (https://youtu.be/2qltHuOjD54) to understand this plugin is from its author (but watch the other two, the developer is funny). Once the plugin is installed, Run the command cmd + P Type \"button\" (then select \"Button Maker\") Create your button (select the type of button you want to create from the menu) Change two or three settings (like the appearance or whether you want the button to disappear after it's been used) You can also choose to insert an \"inline button\" (the button will be inserted in the line) and it is very elegant. Dashboard \u29eb My dashboard is a home page that displays all the tables of content of each folder or sub-folder. By using ![[Text]] , you can insert the content of a note into another note (remember?). Thus, each table of content can be displayed in the main table and refreshed automatically. Makes sense? The dashboard presents a few buttons (\u201cinline buttons\u201d): Pin, Edit / Preview, New Note, Search ... This allows certain actions to be performed faster. I also placed my tags there or the tasks to be accomplished before 2071. ### Tags & Tags pane First, activate the \u201cCore plugin\u201d Tag pane. As stated in the plugin description: Adds a panel on the right that displays all the tags you have, along with their tag count. And since I found it easier to have it on the left, I simply dragged it to the left to have it next to the magnifying glass or the star where I do my research or place the most frequently used notes. About tags ... I discovered the extent of the possibilities induced by [YAML] (https://youtu.be/rAoFGGMG-0g). To make it very short, YAML = metadata. As a reminder, metadata is data about your data. It provides information about your data. For example, metadata of a photo give you the size, the type of device, but also the date and time, the location or even, depending on the program you are using, information about people or things appearing in the photo... The metadata that you are going to place in your notes can therefore be the author, the date, tags and so forth. To learn more about YAML and how to use it, you can read and see this and that to understand exactly what it's all about: YAML front matter YAML | In One Video Even better, check out [An Introduction to Dataview - Part 1] (https://youtu.be/sEgzrRNkgsE). This is an excellent video for understanding YAML, metadata and above all, as we will see down below, the [Dataview] plugin (https://github.com/blacksmithgu/obsidian-dataview). YAML data must be placed at the beginning of the file with --- at the beginning and at the end. --- tags: [Documentation, Markdown] --- Between these --- , you place a \"key\" (for example \"tags\") and a \"value\" (for example \"Markdown\"). At the moment Obsidian only accepts three keys: tags , aliases , and cssclass , but that doesn't matter much because you will inevitably be using Dataview . The advantages are immense but the first that occurred to me is that my tags do not appear when exporting the note. They don't clutter up the page. But above all, we can go much further with [Dataview] (https://github.com/blacksmithgu/obsidian-dataview). Dataview \u29eb To find out everything that I could not explain to you in a few lines about Dataview, see: An Introduction to Dataview - Part 1 An Introduction to Dataview - Part 2 It seems, at least if I am to believe those who know exactly what it is, that they look like SQL queries. In fact, you can turn your notes into a database that you can easily extract from. I can, for example, ask to have a list of all the files located in this folder (providing I click Preview). Simply write this: ```` list ````` But, of course, this is the simplest example I can give. There is so much more you can do! You can even make tables and sort your notes by date, author or rating, etc. The best solution is to watch it: For that, you will use operators like from or where to filter the list and display for example a specific hashtag. Or list the contents of a folder (put quotes: \"The folder\" ). You can: use boolean operator AND or OR use the minus sign -Google to exclude certain terms from the search use the + sign to concatenate create tables etc. Conclusion \u29eb As I said at the beginning of the article, I probably missed a lot of things. I don't really use Hotkeys (not as much as I should) or Vim . But this permanent feeling of having to discover a vast terra incognita is a real pleasure in the daily use of Obsidian. I know I always have something to explore. In addition, the application is free. However, I paid \u00a3 25 which gave me access to the beta of the mobile app (which is not in beta anymore by the way). I feel that there is still a lot of work on this side (I would have liked to be able to open files that I share between iA Writer and Working copy). Anyway, I am not paying for the sync service since I am using iCloud. On the other hand, I would gladly pay for the publishing service (and in fact, I am abandoning the iA / Writer / Working Copy duo). In my wish list, I would like to find natively the export richness of a Bear or a Draft. Pandoc is awesome, but somewhat insufficient. Maybe I need to master it. Finally, I would like to see what teachers would do with such an app. It's more of a nerd-oriented use so I'm not sure it appeals to the crowds but who knows. But what if the students had Obsidian?

If the importance of keeping control of your data, not entrusting apps that are likely to lock them into an ecosystem that does not care about openness or communication with other applications is an essential feature for you, you will also appreciate that the Markdown remains (more or less) displayed as Markdown and is not subject to any adjustment whatsoever to erase its traces. Applications that I appreciate a lot like Ulysses, iA Writer or Bear tend to offer their own version of Markdown and take some liberties which I would do well without (and which I do without).","title":"1. Markdown"},{"location":"Documentation/Obsidian/Obsidian%20English%20Version/#2-html","text":"Obsidian is based on HTML, JavasScript and CSS. There is even a console like in a browser ( alt + cmd + i ). You therefore have the possibility of inserting HTML. Thus, you can insert various small very useful tags ( <sup> / </sup> , <br /> ...), but also, for example, a table (and everyone knows that this is not the strongest point of Markdown). Here's a much more complex one than I could not have done with Markdown alone: <table cellpadding=\"5\"> <tr> <th colspan=\"2\" rowspan=\"2\" style=\"border-style:none;\"></th> <th colspan = \"3\">Formes conjointes</th> <th rowspan=\"2\">Formes<br />disjointes</th> </tr> <tr> <td>Sujet</td> <td>Compl\u00e9ment direct</td> <td>Compl\u00e9ment indirect</td> </tr> <tr> <th rowspan=\"4\">Sing.</th> <td>1<sup>re</sup> pers.</td> <td>je</td> <td>me</td> <td>me</td> <td>moi</td> </tr> <tr> <td>2<sup>e</sup> pers.</td> <td>tu</td> <td>te</td> <td>te</td> <td>toi</td> </tr> <tr> <td>3<sup>e</sup> pers.</td> <td>il, elle</td> <td>le, la, en</td> <td>lui, en, y</td> <td>lui, elle</td> </tr> <tr> <td></td> <td></td> <td>se</td> <td>se</td> <td>soi (soi-m\u00eame)</td> </tr> <tr> <th rowspan=\"4\">Plur.</th> <td>1<sup>re</sup> pers.</td> <td>nous</td> <td>nous</td> <td>nous</td> <td>nous</td> </tr> <tr> <td>2<sup>e</sup> pers.</td> <td>vous</td> <td>vous</td> <td>vous</td> <td>vous</td> </tr> <tr> <td>3<sup>e</sup> pers.</td> <td>ils, elles</td> <td>les, leur, se</td> <td>leur, en, y, se</td> <td>eux, elles, </td> </tr> </table> But, of course, you can also insert iframes in your notes. This means that you can insert entire web pages, tweets, a list from Dynalist, a Genially, a Google Calendar or even a Pomodoro... <iframe src=\"https://pomofocus.io/\" height=\"700\" width=\"700\"></iframe> Maybe it's worth mentioning that I had a problem with displaying tweets. As they are not shown correctly, I have found Twitframe which displays a nice and proper tweet.","title":"2. HTML"},{"location":"Documentation/Obsidian/Obsidian%20English%20Version/#3-css-snippets","text":"You can modify the Obsidian style sheet and adapt the display of your notes to your needs. But the stroke of genius is to allow the creation of small \"snippets\" which replace the modified elements in the main CSS. So you don't have to edit the main file, but can turn on or off certain portions of CSS on the fly. For now, I have contented myself with modifying the appearance of the tags and quotes by copying the code I found here and there. But the next time I want to offer nice documents to my students, I will be able to develop a template of my own. Anyway, it is quite simple. Just create a .css file with your favorite editor. When you are finished, place this file in the snippets folder ( .obsidian> snippets ). Check out the Meta Post - CSS Themes - Share & showcase - Obsidian Forum . You will find pretty things ready to use.","title":"3. CSS Snippets"},{"location":"Documentation/Obsidian/Obsidian%20English%20Version/#4-themes","text":"Not much to say. The thing is pretty self-explanatory: you can download different \"templates\". Choose the one you like. For my part, I opted for Cybertron Comfort color dark. Go to Settings> Appearance> Themes . It is very pleasant to be able to personalize your own working environment. This is, by the way, an area that I have explored very little, but Obsidian's flexibility in this matter is great.","title":"4. Themes"},{"location":"Documentation/Obsidian/Obsidian%20English%20Version/#5-links","text":"The ability to link notes together is the first thing that appealed to me when I discovered this kind of apps. I already had this possibility in Bear and since I got a glimpse of the Zettelkasten method, this is something that is now essential to me. These are called \"wikilinks\". I use them, among other things, to create a table of contents or to gather scattered notes (for example, all the notes that I take, say, when I read a book by Jules Verne, are thus \"connected\" a little bit like in a wiki). Just open double square brackets and type the name of the note. [[Note Mysterious Island]] We also have the possibility of aggregating these notes between them. You just have to add an exclamation point, which is handy. For example, imagine you are a French teacher and you have various scattered texts that you have studied with your students and you want to put them all together to make your exam list. No need to copy and paste everything. Just insert each note into one by inserting the links. ! [Obsidian](./Obsidian.md) Another interesting possibility: Copy Obsidian url . We get something like obsidian://open? Vault=Tech&file=Markdown%2FObsidian . That is, if I am not mistaken, some sort of x-callback-url , which should come in handy for automating some tasks. Still on the subject of links, in Preview mode, it's quite nice to have this little window for previewing the content of a link, a bit like on Wikipedia, when you hover the mouse over the link.","title":"5. Links"},{"location":"Documentation/Obsidian/Obsidian%20English%20Version/#6-tags","text":"They are not specific to Obsidian, but I would be sad to do without them. As you can see above, with a little CSS, I tried to make them look better. And since I spend time linking my notes together, I also take time to tag everything so that I can better find everything that, in my life as a teacher, I have been able to produce (more on that later). Thus, the tags allow me to carry out a more detailed search to find (for instance) all the writing exercises that I have been able to propose to my students or even sort them by level or subject. Obviously, this is a work in progress, but just as I want to have documents that are portable regardless of the application I use or will be using, I make sure I can find and gather everything that is still terribly scattered. Like I said, more on that when it comes to the Dataview plugin.","title":"6.

To get this mind map, open the command ( cmd + P ) and type \"mind map\". To export the image, click on the three small dots on the right above the mind map and click on \"Copy screenshot\".","title":"7.

It is like a starry sky or rather a constellation which allows you to see a graphic representation of your notes. All those that are connected together are linked by a line. Those with the most references are bigger. These dots are all clickable and allow you to navigate easily through this labyrinth made up of your notes. Everything is editable. You can change the CSS. You can filter or only show certain things (orphan notes, images or other documents, etc.). That is wonderful. ![[graph-view.gif]]","title":"8. Graph View"},{"location":"Documentation/Obsidian/Obsidian%20English%20Version/#9-plugins","text":"Last but not least, plugins. You will tell me, the \"graph view\" is a plugin (like the mind map for that matter), but it is a plugin that is part of the \"Core plugins\". Among these, I also like Tag Pane or Daily Notes. As its name suggests, the latter is used to take daily notes. Basically every time you open the app, a note is created. Convenient for taking notes on the fly. It reminds me a little of Draft which, each time it is launched, opens a blank page ready to welcome the fruit of your reflections. There is another set of plugins, third party plugins, made by other developers that bring enrichment to the application that goes beyond expectation. You will find them by clicking on the small cogwheel at the bottom left corner and then heading to Community plugins . You will also need to deactivate the Safe mode (same location). You can click on any of these links to search for plugins: List of plugins ) Third party plugins For now, these are the plugins I use the more: Better Word Count Ozan's Image in Editor Plugin Kindle Plugin Readwise Text Snippets Pandoc Review Natural language Dates Editor Syntax Highlight Advanced Tables Templates Buttons Tags and Tags pane Dataview Here is, very quickly, what can be said about these plugins.","title":"9.

You can import all the highlighted and annotated excerpts on your Kindle (with Kindle Highlights ). Super handy, because all your quotes are available in text format, so you can easily insert them into an essay or an article. It also allows you to find them more easily perhaps because the search can be filtered using tags. Do you remember that we can link notes together? You can also link a note to only a part (a block) of another note. Read Link to blocks to learn more. This allows you to insert your quote quite easily.","title":"Kindle Plugin"},{"location":"Documentation/Obsidian/Obsidian%20English%20Version/#readwise","text":"Obviously, I'm not only highlighting things in my Kindle.

Fran\u00e7ois Jourde introduced me to Text Blaze . I also knew Text Expander . I use a lot, on the iPad, iPhone or Mac, the Text Replacement function, but this is also available on Obsidian thanks to this plugin. The idea is to define a keyword (in the example below, the word \"I\") and when you activate the appropriate keyboard shortcut, it inserts a whole portion of text that has been defined in advance. This is extremely useful when you grade digital essays, for example. You define a \"snippet\" and it inserts the text automatically.","title":"Text Snippets"},{"location":"Documentation/Obsidian/Obsidian%20English%20Version/#pandoc","text":"While browsing the export possibilities, I had a feeling of disappointment. Only PDF is permitted. Fortunately, a kind developer has created a plugin to take advantage of Pandoc which I have already mentioned here . In short, you install the plugin and to summon Pandoc, run the command (use the shortcut cmd + P ) then type \u201cPandoc\u201d. At first, it didn't work. I had to change the path /usr/local/bin/pandoc in settings (after typing which pandoc in Terminal).

Press Enter to go to the first row. Continue filling cells as before, and press Enter again for each new row. When the cursor is placed in the table, you can use the following keyboard shortcuts: Hotkey Action Tab Next Cell Shift + Tab Previous Cell Enter Next Row Cmd + Shift + D Open table controls sidebar Sometimes the easiest way is still to use the command ( cmd + P ) and type \"table\" to find what you need.

At the end of a table, Insert an HTML comment: <! - -> (without forgetting the spaces) Add TBLFM: (= table format): <! - TBLFM: -> Specify the destination & the source (in fact, where the formula will be placed: last row, last column) @>$2 Specify the formula: = sum () Give the first row: @I (= first row under the header) Then the last one: @-1 (= last row) Use the shortcut ( cmd + option + D ) or the command ( cmd + P ) and choose evaluate formulas You should get this: | Things | Number | | ------ | ------ | | One | 1 | | Two | 2 | | Three | 3 | | Total | 6 | <!-- TBLFM: @>$2=sum(@I..@-1) --> I must admit that it is not super user friendly, but it is rather fun (although I will use a spreadsheet preferably for this kind of thing). ### Templates When one wants to avoid writing and rewriting the same thing over and over again, one creates templates. For example, I created a template to write a lesson plan that I give to my students. The template automatically inserts the main titles and tags. To do that, I create a new file, use the following shortcut: cmd + \u21e7 + i , choose the desired template and my lesson plan is automatically inserted. I just have to fill it out. As a teacher, I would like to use the templates to speed up email writing to communicate more with parents to quickly report any misbehaving or problems. Anyway, I feel like I'm going to create a lot of templates. If you want to know more, [watch this video made by Bryan Jenks] (https://youtu.be/1eUxQo6Dy7k) to understand how to create templates (the second part of the video talks about the Templater plugin but it seemed a little complex to me). Also read [Obsidian help] (https://help.obsidian.md/Plugins/Templates). But, basically, it's relatively simple: Activate the templates in Core plugins (in the settings) Create a Templates folder (to store your templates) Create in this folder a template (in fact, a simple file containing everything you want to reuse) Launch your template (for example, you create a file and insert your template into it)","title":"Formulas"},{"location":"Documentation/Obsidian/Obsidian%20English%20Version/#buttons","text":"As surprising as it may seem, you can insert a button in a note! Well, after all, we already knew that we could insert an iframe or a table containing a formula like in a spreadsheet. So why not a button? To do this, download the [Buttons] plugin (https://github.com/shabegom/buttons). There is a wizard for creating a button, but it's actually a few lines of code appearing in your note that contain something like this: ```button name Pin type command action Toggle pin color green ``` ^button-buttonpin Basically, you have the name of the button (name) the type (what the button does) the action performed the colour OK, but what do we do with that? Well I imagine the possibilities are quite large (bis repetita ...), but as you will find out in the next section of this article, I created a few on a note that I called the dashboard. In the meantime, know that the options to create the buttons are as follows: Command: Click the Button to run a Command from the Command Palette Link: Click the Button to open a URL or URI Calculate: Click the Button to run a math calculation.

By using ![[Text]] , you can insert the content of a note into another note (remember?). Thus, each table of content can be displayed in the main table and refreshed automatically. Makes sense? The dashboard presents a few buttons (\u201cinline buttons\u201d): Pin, Edit / Preview, New Note, Search ... This allows certain actions to be performed faster. I also placed my tags there or the tasks to be accomplished before 2071. ### Tags & Tags pane First, activate the \u201cCore plugin\u201d Tag pane. As stated in the plugin description: Adds a panel on the right that displays all the tags you have, along with their tag count. And since I found it easier to have it on the left, I simply dragged it to the left to have it next to the magnifying glass or the star where I do my research or place the most frequently used notes. About tags ... I discovered the extent of the possibilities induced by [YAML] (https://youtu.be/rAoFGGMG-0g). To make it very short, YAML = metadata. As a reminder, metadata is data about your data. It provides information about your data. For example, metadata of a photo give you the size, the type of device, but also the date and time, the location or even, depending on the program you are using, information about people or things appearing in the photo... The metadata that you are going to place in your notes can therefore be the author, the date, tags and so forth. To learn more about YAML and how to use it, you can read and see this and that to understand exactly what it's all about: YAML front matter YAML | In One Video Even better, check out [An Introduction to Dataview - Part 1] (https://youtu.be/sEgzrRNkgsE). This is an excellent video for understanding YAML, metadata and above all, as we will see down below, the [Dataview] plugin (https://github.com/blacksmithgu/obsidian-dataview). YAML data must be placed at the beginning of the file with --- at the beginning and at the end. --- tags: [Documentation, Markdown] --- Between these --- , you place a \"key\" (for example \"tags\") and a \"value\" (for example \"Markdown\"). At the moment Obsidian only accepts three keys: tags , aliases , and cssclass , but that doesn't matter much because you will inevitably be using Dataview . The advantages are immense but the first that occurred to me is that my tags do not appear when exporting the note. They don't clutter up the page. But above all, we can go much further with [Dataview] (https://github.com/blacksmithgu/obsidian-dataview).","title":"Dashboard"},{"location":"Documentation/Obsidian/Obsidian%20English%20Version/#dataview","text":"To find out everything that I could not explain to you in a few lines about Dataview, see: An Introduction to Dataview - Part 1 An Introduction to Dataview - Part 2 It seems, at least if I am to believe those who know exactly what it is, that they look like SQL queries. In fact, you can turn your notes into a database that you can easily extract from. I can, for example, ask to have a list of all the files located in this folder (providing I click Preview). Simply write this: ```` list ````` But, of course, this is the simplest example I can give. There is so much more you can do! You can even make tables and sort your notes by date, author or rating, etc. The best solution is to watch it: For that, you will use operators like from or where to filter the list and display for example a specific hashtag. Or list the contents of a folder (put quotes: \"The folder\" ). You can: use boolean operator AND or OR use the minus sign -Google to exclude certain terms from the search use the + sign to concatenate create tables etc.","title":"Dataview"},{"location":"Documentation/Obsidian/Obsidian%20English%20Version/#conclusion","text":"As I said at the beginning of the article, I probably missed a lot of things. I don't really use Hotkeys (not as much as I should) or Vim . But this permanent feeling of having to discover a vast terra incognita is a real pleasure in the daily use of Obsidian. I know I always have something to explore. In addition, the application is free. However, I paid \u00a3 25 which gave me access to the beta of the mobile app (which is not in beta anymore by the way). I feel that there is still a lot of work on this side (I would have liked to be able to open files that I share between iA Writer and Working copy). Anyway, I am not paying for the sync service since I am using iCloud. On the other hand, I would gladly pay for the publishing service (and in fact, I am abandoning the iA / Writer / Working Copy duo). In my wish list, I would like to find natively the export richness of a Bear or a Draft. Pandoc is awesome, but somewhat insufficient. Maybe I need to master it. Finally, I would like to see what teachers would do with such an app. It's more of a nerd-oriented use so I'm not sure it appeals to the crowds but who knows. But what if the students had Obsidian?

Plus r\u00e9cemment iA Writer et Bear ont fait mon bonheur et depuis que je suis un peu revenu au Mac, j'ai entendu parler d' Obsidian . Le coup de foudre est tel que cela m\u00e9rite une section \u00e0 part dans ce petit dossier consacr\u00e9 au Markdown . Ce que j'aurais \u00e0 dire ici pourrait se r\u00e9sumer en tr\u00e8s peu de mots : ne passez pas \u00e0 c\u00f4t\u00e9 d'une telle application. C'est une merveille comme je n'en ai pas vu depuis 10 ans. En revanche, d\u00e9finir ce qui fait la force de cette application est difficile (app de prise de notes ? Traitement de texte ? PKM ? Sorte d' IDE ?) Et puis expliquer de fond en comble ce qui fait la richesse d'Obsidian prendrait des pages et des pages, mais je peux au moins vous donner une id\u00e9e de sa puissance et montrer quels sont les usages que j'ai d\u00e9velopp\u00e9s et qui n'\u00e9taient pas possibles avec les autres applications que j'ai utilis\u00e9es par le pass\u00e9. Il y a toutefois de fortes chances pour que ces quelques semaines pass\u00e9es avec Obsidian ne m'aient pas permis de percevoir l'enti\u00e9ret\u00e9 des possibilit\u00e9s qui semblent immenses. C'est \u00e0 un point tel que j'ai l'impression d'avoir d\u00e9couvert un nouvel univers, celui des PKM (Personal Knowledge Management) en l'occurrence. Mais enfin essayons. Tout d'abord, apprenez que tout commence par la cr\u00e9ation d'un \u00ab vault \u00bb, ce qui n'est jamais qu'un dossier dans lequel vous allez placer toutes vos notes, tous vos fichiers. Vous pouvez en cr\u00e9er plusieurs, ce que j'ai fait (un pour mes cours, un pour mes lectures, etc.). Dans ce \u00ab vault \u00bb, vous aurez un dossier .obsidian dans lequel se nicheront diff\u00e9rentes choses dont il sera question ci-dessous comme les plugins, les th\u00e8mes ou les fichiers CSS. Mais commen\u00e7ons avec le commencement. Obsidian, c'est avant tout du Markdown. 1. Markdown \u29eb Dans une section d\u00e9di\u00e9e au markdown , il va sans dire que c'est l\u00e0 un point essentiel. Si l'importance de garder le contr\u00f4le de ses donn\u00e9es et de ne pas les confier \u00e0 des apps susceptibles de les enfermer dans un \u00e9cosyst\u00e8me peu soucieux d'ouverture ou de communication avec d'autres applications est toujours de rigueur, on appr\u00e9ciera aussi que le Markdown reste (\u00e0 peu pr\u00e8s) affich\u00e9 comme du Markdown et ne fasse pas l'objet d'un am\u00e9nagement quelconque pour en effacer les traces. Des applications que j'appr\u00e9cie beaucoup comme Ulysses, iA Writer ou Bear ont tendance \u00e0 proposer leur version du Markdown et prennent quelques libert\u00e9s dont je me passerais bien (et dont je me passe de fait). 2. HTML \u29eb Obsidian repose sur du HTML, du JavasScript et du CSS. On a donc la possibilit\u00e9 d'ins\u00e9rer du HTML. Ainsi, on peut ins\u00e9rer diff\u00e9rentes petites balises bien utiles ( <sup>/</sup> , <br /> ...), mais aussi, par exemple, un tableau (et on sait que ce n'est pas le fort du Markdown). En voici un bien plus complexe que ce que j'aurais pu faire avec le seul Markdown : <table cellpadding=\"5\"> <tr> <th colspan=\"2\" rowspan=\"2\" style=\"border-style:none;\"></th> <th colspan = \"3\">Formes conjointes</th> <th rowspan=\"2\">Formes<br />disjointes</th> </tr> <tr> <td>Sujet</td> <td>Compl\u00e9ment direct</td> <td>Compl\u00e9ment indirect</td> </tr> <tr> <th rowspan=\"4\">Sing.</th> <td>1<sup>re</sup> pers.</td> <td>je</td> <td>me</td> <td>me</td> <td>moi</td> </tr> <tr> <td>2<sup>e</sup> pers.</td> <td>tu</td> <td>te</td> <td>te</td> <td>toi</td> </tr> <tr> <td>3<sup>e</sup> pers.</td> <td>il, elle</td> <td>le, la, en</td> <td>lui, en, y</td> <td>lui, elle</td> </tr> <tr> <td></td> <td></td> <td>se</td> <td>se</td> <td>soi (soi-m\u00eame)</td> </tr> <tr> <th rowspan=\"4\">Plur.</th> <td>1<sup>re</sup> pers.</td> <td>nous</td> <td>nous</td> <td>nous</td> <td>nous</td> </tr> <tr> <td>2<sup>e</sup> pers.</td> <td>vous</td> <td>vous</td> <td>vous</td> <td>vous</td> </tr> <tr> <td>3<sup>e</sup> pers.</td> <td>ils, elles</td> <td>les, leur, se</td> <td>leur, en, y, se</td> <td>eux, elles, </td> </tr> </table> Mais \u00e9videmment, vous pouvez ins\u00e9rer aussi des iframes dans vos notes. Cela veut dire que vous pouvez ins\u00e9rer des pages web enti\u00e8res, des tweets, une liste provenant de Dynalist, un Genially, un Google Calendar voire un Pomodoro... <iframe src=\"https://pomofocus.io/\" height=\"700\" width=\"700\"></iframe> Il y a m\u00eame une console comme dans un navigateur ( alt + cmd + i ). 3. CSS Snippets \u29eb Vous pouvez modifier la feuille de style d'Obsidian et adapter l'affichage de vos textes \u00e0 vos moindres souhaits. Mais le coup de g\u00e9nie est de permettre de cr\u00e9er de petits \u00ab snippets \u00bb qui remplacent les \u00e9l\u00e9ments modifi\u00e9s dans le CSS principal. Ainsi, vous n'avez pas \u00e0 modifier le fichier principal, mais pouvez activer ou d\u00e9sactiver \u00e0 la vol\u00e9e certaines portions de CSS. Pour l'instant, je me suis content\u00e9 de modifier l'apparence des tags et des citations en reprenant le code ici et l\u00e0. Mais la prochaine fois que je veux proposer des cours \u00e0 mes \u00e9l\u00e8ves, je serai en mesure d'\u00e9laborer un template qui m'est propre. En tout cas, c'est assez simple. Il suffit de cr\u00e9er un fichier .css avec votre \u00e9diteur pr\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9. Quand vous avez termin\u00e9, placez ce fichier dans le dossier snippets ( .obsidian > snippets ). Allez faire un tour sur Meta Post - CSS Themes - Share & showcase - Obsidian Forum . Vous trouvez de jolies choses pr\u00eates \u00e0 l'emploi. 4. Th\u00e8mes \u29eb Pas grand-chose \u00e0 dire. La chose est assez explicite en soi : vous pouvez t\u00e9l\u00e9charger diff\u00e9rents \u00ab templates \u00bb. Choisissez celui \u00e0 votre go\u00fbt. Pour ma part, j'ai opt\u00e9 pour Cybertron. Direction Settings > Appearance > Themes . C'est en tout cas bien agr\u00e9able de pouvoir personnaliser son environnement de travail. C'est, soit dit en passant, un domaine que j'ai bien peu explor\u00e9, mais la flexibilit\u00e9 d'Obsidian en la mati\u00e8re est grande. 5. Liens \u29eb La possibilit\u00e9 de lier des notes entre elles est la premi\u00e8re chose qui m'a s\u00e9duite quand j'ai d\u00e9couvert ce genre d'apps. Je jouissais d\u00e9j\u00e0 de cette possibilit\u00e9 dans Bear et depuis que j'ai eu un aper\u00e7u de la m\u00e9thode Zettelkasten , c'est l\u00e0 quelque chose qui m'est d\u00e9sormais essentiel. Ce sont ce qu'on appelle des \u00ab wikilinks \u00bb. Je l'utilise, entre autres, pour cr\u00e9er une table des mati\u00e8res ou pour rassembler des notes \u00e9parses (par exemple, toutes les notes que je prends, disons, quand je lis un livre de Jules Verne, sont ainsi \u00ab connect\u00e9es \u00bb \u00e0 la fa\u00e7on d'un lien wiki). Il suffit simplement d'ouvrir de doubles crochets et de taper le nom de la note. [[Note \u00cele myst\u00e9rieuse]] On a \u00e9galement la possibilit\u00e9 d'agr\u00e9ger ces notes entre elles. Il faut juste ajouter un point d'exclamation, ce qui est bien pratique. Par exemple, imaginons que vous \u00eates professeur de fran\u00e7ais et que vous avez diff\u00e9rents textes \u00e9parses que vous avez \u00e9tudi\u00e9s avec vos \u00e9l\u00e8ves et que vous voulez tous les rassembler pour faire votre liste du baccalaur\u00e9at. Inutile de tout copier coller. Il suffit d'ins\u00e9rer chaque note en une seule en ins\u00e9rant les liens. ![Obsidian](./Obsidian.md) Autre possibilit\u00e9 int\u00e9ressante : Copy Obsidian url . On obtient quelque chose comme obsidian://open?vault=Tech&file=Markdown%2FObsidian . C'est, si je ne m'abuse une sorte de x-callback-url , ce qui devrait s'av\u00e9rer pratique pour automatiser certaines t\u00e2ches. Toujours \u00e0 propos de lien, en mode Preview, c'est assez agr\u00e9able d'avoir cette petite fen\u00eatre de pr\u00e9visualisation du contenu d'un lien, un peu comme sur Wikip\u00e9dia, quand on passe la souris au-dessus de ce lien. 6. Tags \u29eb Ils ne sont pas sp\u00e9cifiques \u00e0 Obsidian, mais j'aurais du mal \u00e0 m'en passer. Comme vous avez pu le voir plus haut, avec un peu de CSS, je me suis efforc\u00e9 de les rendre plus esth\u00e9tiques. Et comme je passe du temps \u00e0 lier mes notes entre elles, je prends aussi du temps pour tout \u00ab taguer \u00bb afin de pouvoir mieux retrouver tout ce que, dans ma vie d'enseignant, j'ai pu produire. Ainsi, par exemple, les tags me permettent de proc\u00e9der \u00e0 une recherche plus fine pour trouver (autre exemple) tous les exercices de r\u00e9daction que j'ai pu proposer ou encore les trier par niveau ou sujet. \u00c9videmment, c'est un travail en cours, mais de la m\u00eame fa\u00e7on que je tiens \u00e0 avoir des documents dont la portabilit\u00e9 est assur\u00e9e quelle que soit l'application que j'utilise ou utiliserai, je veille \u00e0 pouvoir retrouver et rassembler tout ce qui est encore affreusement \u00e9parpill\u00e9. Work in progress ! 7. Mind map \u29eb La fonction n'est pas indispensable, mais j'aime bien l'id\u00e9e de l'avoir : on peut exporter un fichier texte au format image et ainsi avoir une carte mentale. Pour avoir cette carte mentale, ouvrez la commande ( cmd + P ) et tapez \u00ab mind map \u00bb. Pour exporter l'image, cliquez sur les trois petits points \u00e0 droite au-dessus de la carte mentale et cliquez sur \u00ab Copy screenshot \u00bb. 8. Graph View \u29eb Ce Graph View est peut-\u00eatre la plus jolie chose que j'ai vue. C'est comme un ciel \u00e9toil\u00e9 ou plut\u00f4t une constellation qui donne \u00e0 voir une r\u00e9pr\u00e9sentation graphique de vos notes. Toutes celles qui sont li\u00e9es entre elles sont reli\u00e9es par un trait. Celles qui ont le plus de r\u00e9f\u00e9rences sont plus grosses. Ces points sont tous cliquables et vous permettent de naviguer ais\u00e9ment \u00e0 travers ce labyrinthe constitu\u00e9 de vos notes. Tout est modifiable. On peut changer le CSS. On peut filtrer ou ne faire apparaitre que certaines choses (les notes orphelines, les images ou autres documents, etc.). C'est merveilleux. ![[graph-view.gif]] 9. Plugins \u29eb Last but not least, les plugins. Vous me direz, le \u00ab graph view \u00bb est un plugin (comme le mind map d'ailleurs), mais c'est un plugin faisant partie des \u00ab Core plugins \u00bb. Parmi ceux-l\u00e0, j'affectionne \u00e9galement Daily notes. Comme son nom l'indique, il sert \u00e0 prendre des notes quotidiennes. En gros, \u00e0 chaque fois que vous ouvrez l'application, une note est cr\u00e9\u00e9e. Pratique pour prendre des notes \u00e0 la vol\u00e9e. \u00c7a me fait un peu penser \u00e0 Draft qui, \u00e0 chaque fois qu'on le lance, ouvre une page blanche pr\u00eate \u00e0 accueillir le fruit de vos r\u00e9flexions. Il existe une autre s\u00e9rie de plugins, des plugins de tierce partie qui apportent un enrichissement de l'application qui va au-del\u00e0 de toute attente. Vous les trouverez en cliquant sur la petite roue dent\u00e9e en bas \u00e0 gauche et en allant dans Community plugins . Il vous faudra \u00e9galement d\u00e9sactiver le Safe mode (toujours au m\u00eame endroit). Vous pouvez cliquer sur l'un de ces liens pour chercher des plugins : Liste des plugins Plugins de tierce partie Pour l'instant, j'utilise les plugins suivants : Better Word Count Ozan's Image in Editor Plugin Kindle Plugin Readwise Text Snippets Pandoc Review Natural language Dates Editor Syntax Highlight Voici, tr\u00e8s rapidement, ce que l'on peut dire de ces plugins. Better Word Count \u29eb Un plugin tr\u00e8s simple qui permet de compter le nombre de mots d'une page bien s\u00fbr (comme tous les compteurs de ce type), mais aussi en s\u00e9lectionnant une portion de texte uniquement. Tr\u00e8s pratique si vous devez remplir un document avec un nombre de mots r\u00e9duits ou si vous \u00e9crivez vos tweets d'abord sur Obsidian. Ozan's Image in Editor Plugin \u29eb Ce plugin permet de voir les images y compris en mode \u00e9diteur tout en gardant cependant l'affichage du lien de l'image. Pr\u00e9cisons au passage qu'il y a une option dans Obsidian qui permet de mettre \u00e0 jour automatiquement ce lien si vous d\u00e9placez ou renommez ce lien. Kindle Plugin \u29eb Certainement, avec le plugin suivant, celui qui m'a donn\u00e9 envie d'adopter Obsidian. On peut importer tous les extraits surlign\u00e9s et annot\u00e9s sur sa Kindle (avec Kindle Highlights ). Super pratique, car toutes vos citations sont \u00e0 votre disposition au format texte et vous pouvez ainsi les ins\u00e9rer facilement dans un essai ou un article. \u00c7a vous permet aussi de les retrouver plus facilement peut-\u00eatre, la recherche pouvant \u00eatre filtr\u00e9e par l'utilisation des tags. Et vous vous souvenez qu'on peut lier des notes entre elles ? Mais on peut aussi lier une note \u00e0 une partie seulement (un bloc) d'une autre note (lire Link to blocks pour en savoir plus). Un paragraphe par exemple. Vous pouvez ainsi ins\u00e9rer votre citation assez facilement. Readwise \u29eb \u00c9videmment, il n'y a pas que la Kindle dans la vie. C'est pour \u00e7a que j'utilise Readwise . Kindle Hightlights ne fonctionne qu'avec les livres achet\u00e9s sur Amazon (encore que vous pouvez importer le fichier My Clippings.txt de votre Kindle), mais Readwise propose de collecter \u00e0 peu pr\u00e8s tout ce que vous avez soulign\u00e9 et annot\u00e9 : tweets, articles sauvegard\u00e9s sur Instapaper, Pocket, Books, Feedly, Medium, etc. Si le sujet vous int\u00e9resse, faites un tour sur le forum . Text Snippets \u29eb Je suis devenu un fan absolu de ce genre de choses. Fran\u00e7ois Jourde m'avait fait d\u00e9couvrir Text Blaze . Je connaissais aussi Text Expander . J'utilise \u00e9norm\u00e9ment, sur l'iPad, l'iPhone ou le Mac, la fonction Text Replacement, mais cela est aussi disponible sur Obsidian gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 ce plugin. L'id\u00e9e est de d\u00e9finir un mot-clef (dans l'exemple ci-dessous, le mot \u00ab je \u00bb) et quand on actionne le racourcci clavier idoine, \u00e7a ins\u00e8re toute une portion de texte qu'on a d\u00e9fini \u00e0 l'avance. C'est extr\u00eamement pratique quand vous corrigez des copies num\u00e9riques par exemple. Ainsi, au lieu de taper tout le temps : Il faut proscrire l\u2019utilisation de la premi\u00e8re personne. Il convient de lui pr\u00e9f\u00e9rer un \u00ab nous \u00bb de modestie ou encore des tournures impersonnelles du type \u00ab Il sera question de... \u00bb, \u00ab Il semble que \u00bb, etc. Vous d\u00e9finissez un \u00ab snippet \u00bb et \u00e7a ins\u00e8re le texte automatiquement. Pandoc \u29eb En parcourant les possibilit\u00e9s d'export, j'ai eu un sentiment de d\u00e9ception. Seul le PDF est possible de base (comme disent mes filles). Heureusement, un aimable d\u00e9veloppeur a cr\u00e9\u00e9 un plugin permettant de tirer partie de Pandoc dont j'ai parl\u00e9 d\u00e9j\u00e0 en ces lieux . Bref, vous installez le plugin et pour convoquer Pandoc, lancez la commande (utilisez le raccourci cmd + p ) puis tapez \u00ab Pandoc \u00bb. Au d\u00e9part, \u00e7a ne marchait pas. J\u2019ai d\u00fb changer le chemin /usr/local/bin/pandoc dans les r\u00e9glages (apr\u00e8s avoir tap\u00e9 which pandoc dans le Terminal). Pas trop s\u00fbr d'avoir compris pourquoi, mais \u00e7a marche et je peux \u00e0 pr\u00e9sent exporter au format Word, odt, ePub, HTML, etc. Natural language Dates & Review \u29eb On \u00e9crit @Today (entre autres) et \u00e7a ins\u00e8re la date d'aujourd'hui. \u00c0 utiliser combin\u00e9 avec Review ( cmd + p ). Par exemple, on s\u00e9lectionne une note ou une portion de texte, on lance Review , on choisit une date et le texte s\u00e9lectionn\u00e9 nous sera rappel\u00e9 \u00e0 la date fix\u00e9e. Je ne suis plus tr\u00e8s s\u00fbr, mais je crois qu'il faut l'utiliser avec le plugin Calendar . Editor Syntax Highlight \u29eb Probablement pas le plugin qui me sera le plus utile, encore que je l'utilise volontiers pour stocker quelques bouts de code que j'utilise pour Ralentir travaux . Mais je pense surtout \u00e0 mes coll\u00e8gues de NSI qui vont pouvoir ins\u00e9rer des portions de code dans leurs cours avec la coloration syntaxique. Conclusion \u29eb Comme je l'ai dit en d\u00e9but d'article, je suis probablement, forc\u00e9ment pass\u00e9 \u00e0 c\u00f4t\u00e9 de beaucoup, beaucoup de choses. Je n'utilise pas vraiment les Hotkeys ni Vim . Mais cette impression permanente d'avoir \u00e0 d\u00e9couvrir une vaste terra incognita est un vrai plaisir dans l'utilisation quotidienne d'Obsidian. On sait qu'on a toujours un truc \u00e0 explorer. De surcro\u00eet, l'application est gratuite. J'ai toutefois pay\u00e9 \u00a325, ce qui m'a donn\u00e9 acc\u00e8s \u00e0 la b\u00eata de l'app mobile. On sent qu'il y a de ce c\u00f4t\u00e9 encore pas mal de travail (j'aurais aim\u00e9 pouvoir ouvrir le dossier que je partage entre iA Writer et Working copy). En tout cas, je ne paye pas pour le service de synchronisation puisque j'utilise iCloud. En revanche, je paierais volontiers pour le service de publication (et de fait, j'abandonne le couple iA/Writer/Working Copy). Dans ma wish list, j'aimerais retrouver la richesse d'export d'un Bear ou d'un Draft. Pandoc est appr\u00e9ciable, mais quelque peu insuffisant. Enfin, j'aimerais voir ce que les enseignants feraient avec une telle application. C'est d'un usage plut\u00f4t orient\u00e9 nerd donc je ne suis pas s\u00fbr que \u00e7a s\u00e9duise les foules. Mais si les \u00e9l\u00e8ves avaient Obsidian ? Imaginez la richesse de certains cours. Il faudrait alors un environnement collaboratif comme GitHub. Ce serait plut\u00f4t pour des lyc\u00e9ens, mais \u00e7a pourrait \u00eatre int\u00e9ressant. Reste qu'Obsidian peut un peu d\u00e9router, si vous avez besoin de renseignements suppl\u00e9mentaires, les sites suivants m'ont consid\u00e9rablement aid\u00e9.

All you need is to know how to deliver online classes in the most effective way possible, how to set up your virtual class in a new learning environment. But that's not the easy part. As one can read in 5 Traps That Will Kill Online Learning (and Strategies to Avoid Them) : Another big pitfall is thinking that if you know how to teach in the physical world, all you need to do is just log onto an online tool, and you will be effective at teaching in the virtual world. That is just absolutely not true. Indeed, it's not about how to replicate your lessons in another medium. In fact, you have to find a new way of teaching. You have to ask yourself how students learn online and when and even what. In this document, to begin with, we'll talk about the equipment you need to embrace online teaching. We'll then show you how to design an online lesson. You'll then learn how to engage students and how to communicate despite the distance. Finally, we'll explain how to assess online so we avoid any cheating issues. Prepare your desk \u29eb In my opinion, you need at least two devices. A laptop and a tablet \u29eb During the lockdown, I was using my Mac with Zoom to talk to students, to chat with them, to see them or to take attendance. In addition to that, I was using my iPad as a whiteboard shared with them to write and explain things. So one device to speak and see (Zoom), one device to write (whiteboard app). If you need help to use Zoom, please read this four parts tutorial . If you need to understand how to create, use, share a whiteboard, please refer to this document . Not to mention a silent and well-lit place, a proper desk for all these devices (and probably books and paper. So a lot of space) and, of course, headphones. That\u2019s it? Well, there\u2019s more... But this can\u2019t be mandatory because it has a cost. It occurred to me that if I had to spend so much time online, I had to invest a little bit (and all this gear could be used for making podcasts and videos as well). Let me explain: one must confess that the camera on most computers is not very good. To be honest, the one on my MacBook is terrible. However, the one on my iPhone is good. So I bought this multi-angle arm on Amazon . Not only it allows me to show myself so that students don\u2019t only see me from the bottom offering a good overview of my chin, it also can be used as a document viewer, provided you download this free app, Overview . ![[Arm.jpeg | 300]] In addition, I bought a USB microphone. After reading some articles ( this one , this one and that one ), I picked the Rode NT-USB . Coupled with an arm , it will avoid any pain neck. So now we\u2019re good to go. Fire up Zoom! Guidance for remote teaching \u29eb Speaking of Zoom, one last thing. Please remember some of the recommendations we gave last year to teachers: [...] think carefully about the physical space from which they will be streaming and how this is going to look on screen from the students\u2019 point of view (no inappropriate visuals, no personal information, no sensitive information). [...] be fully dressed for work if teaching from home. We also added these important things: You do not know who could be listening All contacts to be made exclusively through school-issued email accounts No use of personal phone numbers, no WhatsApp, no personal email. I want to stress the importance of the first advice in this list: you don\u2019t know who is listening. This could be a brother or a sister (children may share a room). This could be a parent (monitoring his/her child, being curious...). Your lesson could be recorded (without your knowledge) and shared with others... So there is a lot of issues to bear in mind. You have to be careful. Plan your online classes \u29eb Give clear instructions & guidelines \u29eb When we shifted to online teaching, I had to rethink the way I transmit instructions. Before we all went online, when I was in front of my students, I could always explicate my expectations. Now, my instructions are much more detailed, precise and numerous. I try to prioritise things clearly, make organisation and navigation easy, in Google Classroom for instance. But Trello is a great tool for managing and collaborating with team members (your colleagues in your department or your students) on work projects and tasks. Moreover, during online teaching, you can\u2019t improvise. In a brick-and-mortar school, you can easily do that: a student raises a question and you go for it. You start answering and you give up what you had planned, because it seems now more relevant, more important... Online, you need to follow a procedure because it's much harder to improvise. (it\u2019s feasible but it\u2019s harder). You got to give your students a clear direction of what is expected. Otherwise, they are going to be confused, to wait for clear instructions, seated in a bedroom with only a Zoom meeting. And they probably won\u2019t listen the all-day... According to me, this advice (from this article I mentioned above) is the best one can give: the learning content is one small fraction of an effective learning experience. In my view, during online teaching, you need to move a little bit away from content and lean toward skills, task-based assessment or questions that students don't just have to Google. Moreover, you need to reflect on that: the content on one hand and the way you are going to deliver it online on the other hand. We\u2019ll see that in the next section, but keep in mind that, to engage students, you need to give them a task to accomplish, to do something other than listening. If they only have to listen, they can get easily bored, they drift off, they can simply turn off the camera and the mic, and nothing is happening. To avoid that, you can give them work that has to be done before the end of the class. You can then check if this is done or not, provide feedback and so on. Assessing a good listener on Zoom is much harder! Synchronous and asynchronous learning \u29eb Maybe, as a teacher, you are used to synchronicity. It means everyone is doing something at the same time, in the same room, learning the same thing. That's what is synchronous learning. Asynchronous is the opposite: students and the teacher are not engaged in the process at the same time, there is no real-time interaction. And no-one is in the same space. But can't we take advantage of that? Using breakout rooms for instance. You are not dealing with 20 to 30 students in the same space at the same time. It's an opportunity to make everyone work at his/her own pace, on specific and differentiate topics. You can deal with them as individuals without no one interfering. But let's close these parentheses for now and go back to our subject. I do think there is a need to alternate synchronous and asynchronous moments. In fact, in my view, your class should be a combination of the two. A synchronous lesson's purpose is to gather everyone (both teacher and students or a group of students), to maybe feeling a sense of being part of a community, to exchange ideas in real-time and get immediate feedback... But, according to me, you don\u2019t need in-person communication which requires no interaction. Instead use videos to deliver instructions (it\u2019s a little bit like a flipped classroom). When online teaching occurs, there is absolutely no need to be in front of your computer, to listen to someone and do nothing else. However, do schedule synchronous times to give students the opportunity to work on a specific task (like writing an essay or a paragraph) so you can check on every student, provide personalised feedback, give one-on-one instruction, have an interactive discussion, answer student's questions... For asynchronous learning to happen, you can post a short video with clear instructions. Students will listen at their own pace, complete this based on their understanding rather than on when class time ends. Next step, provide exercises or an essay to write, so students can show their understanding of the lesson and so on. You will assess their work later when they finished it. Or if you want to make your students work on oral communication, there is no need to plan a meeting (as everyone knows, you can be really fatigued by Zoom). There is a way to do that asynchronously by using Flipgrid . Students can record short videos you can review later. In other words, all you have to do is to design your lesson plan to give the opportunity to your students to work synchronously and asynchronously. You need to set up a protocol which facilitates the student\u2019s work. Having a structure and communicating this structure and the expectations of your course is not only clearer but it is also reassuring. Design your lesson \u29eb Distance/Hybrid Learning by Katherine Goyette \u29eb Katherine Goyette provides nice suggestions when it comes to designing your lesson. Read the article Distance/Hybrid Learning and watch the video to learn more. But to sum things up, let's say that: I like this idea to plan a lesson, to divide it into these four sections: Set the stage (welcome your students) Content (deliver content: text, video, books to explore) Collaboration (provide students opportunities to engage with content in a collaborative environment) Synthesize Learning (provide students opportunities to demonstrate learning using a method of their choice) ![[Lesson Design.jpg]] ![[Lesson Design 2.jpg]] This is a flexible approach. Feel free to adapt it according to your need, but it offers a nice framework to explore. To find help, download these two templates (\u2193). You will also find some more explanations. Distance Learning Lesson Plan Template (Google Docs) Distance Learning Lesson Template (Google Slides) The Learning Designer \u29eb Please also have a look at the Learning Designer . This is an online lesson planning tool. In the video ( An Introduction to the Learning Designer ), Eileen Kennedy shows you how to create a learning design. You can find the Learning Designer at ucl.ac.uk . Create an account and create a new design using the Designer. To learn more about this, please read the Learning Designer User Guide . Or you can just have a look, on the Learning Designer website to understand what this is: This design tool will help with the now urgent process of moving your teaching online. The Learning Designer is an online tool to help teachers and lecturers design teaching and learning activities and share their learning designs with each other. It was developed by a team led by Diana Laurillard at the UCL Knowledge Lab, with ESRC funding, and is free for anyone to use. The tool is based on the six learning types from Diana Laurillard\u2019s Conversational Framework \u2013 a model of the conditions necessary for learning to take place. The six learning types are: Read/Write/Listen (or Acquisition), Inquiry, Practice, Production, Discussion and Collaboration. In principle, a good learning design will contain a mix of all of these types of learning. [...] The tool provides feedback on your design by showing you (a) the amount of learning time you have designed, and (b) a pie chart of the proportion of each of the six learning types in your design. You decide what adjustments to make. In principle, a good learning design will contain a mix of all of these types of learning. The Analysis tab also shows the proportions of time learners spend online, with the teacher present, and as a class, group or individual. This is a great way to design your lesson plans. Unfortunately, if the Learning design tool can easily be shared, keep in mind this is not a collaborative tool. Actually, a teacher can design his or her lesson plan, can share it with a colleague, but you will have no option but to make a copy of the shared document, work on it. It will then be yours and the colleague won\u2019t see any change you made. Hopefully, Fran\u00e7ois Jourde and Erwan Gallenne built an awesome spreadsheet facilitating collaboration . If you need help to use it, please drop me a line. One more thing \u29eb I also like this proposition of Alexis Kauffmann . We may call it a pedagogical learning scenario to design your lesson plan. In this example, there are seven steps: Quiz Hello Lesson Exercices made autonomously (Break) Exercices made autonomously Correction Goodbye ![[structure.jpeg]] By clicking on the above link (it's a Twitter thread), you will find tips and explanations. The only apps used are videoconferencing software like Zoom, Google Classroom & Jamboard. Of course, there is a possibility to differentiate, to allow every student to work at his/her own pace. The teacher provides feedback and advice while they work autonomously. To learn more about differentiation, please read this document . Engage the passive students \u29eb Greeting students is very important. Warm-up activities or ice-breakers are of paramount importance these days. It is also very important to make sure that every student is paying attention, is getting focused. That's why I strongly recommend task-based work. If students only have to listen during all day, teaching may happen but learning? That's why we do have to design our lessons by following, for instance, Diana Laurillard\u2019s framework. But you can also make your lesson a little bit more interactive by offering quizzes. A lot of teachers start their lesson with a simple and quick quiz to engage students. It can be a set of simple questions scheduled in Google Classroom about the previous lesson or a Kahoot , just to check if everyone is understanding what has previously been done. Kahoot offers some kind of gamification which is always fun. Anyway, the point is to keep students active, to interact with them. To do that, you have plenty of options. We mentioned Classroom, Kahoot, but there is Pear Deck , Nearpod , Quizlet ... You name it! It is also important to regularly interact with them individually, to just call them by their name, etc. To finish this part, I want to stress the importance of communication. Please refer to my presentation made at the beginning of the Year ( Communication first ). In fact, online learning raises a series of questions. I quote myself (\ud83d\ude03): How, despite the distance, we keep building a strong relationship with our students? How can we make sure our students have a strong connection together so they can help each other? How can we foster collaboration? Indeed, a lot of things we used to do when we were all gathered in a room seem now impossible to do online. Well, this is not entirely true. Tell your students: \"You are not alone\" or \"I can help you in many ways\". So I would like to show two very simple examples of how to create interactions. We will also see that we can foster peer collaboration during online teaching. Google Classroom \u29eb In Google Classroom, just remind your students to write a comment if they don\u2019t understand something. This is why most of the time, I create Assignment (instead of Material or Question ) so that students can comment and ask any question they have whether they want you to give explicit instructions or clarify something. I don\u2019t know for you, but my Google Classroom is only populated by my own posts. I\u2019d like students to express themselves more than they do. Google Groups \u29eb I discovered last year that we didn\u2019t use Google Groups . Google describes this service this way: Google Groups allows you to create and participate in online forums and email-based groups with a rich experience for community conversations. So, basically, you create an email address (for instance group@schooladdress.com ) and every member of this group receives the message that has been written by any member. Why do that? Well, during the past few years, I was sorry to see that the answer I gave to a student only benefited the student who asked the question. I was thinking: Wouldn't it be great if everyone could receive the answer? Google Groups is a great way to ask a question to the class (but of course you can use Classroom if you prefer): did you understand that? When do you want to do this? It\u2019s also a great way to foster collaboration and to make your students interact together a little bit like in a forum. This year, I'm more than pleased to see very young students helping each other. And most of the time, I don't even need to answer questions. Students do and they do this in the most cordial way. I'm really impressed. And I would also like Loom, but I chose to speak about that in the next section of this document. Give and get feedback \u29eb Provide feedback \u29eb At LIL , we make great use of Loom . Some students don\u2019t dare to raise their hand but some others fear that you may make fun of their spelling if they are too shy to speak out loud and choose to write to you. You have to reassure them and say: \u201cWe are here to help you, not to assess you based on your spelling skills\u201d. And, as we are all online, written communication becomes more frequent. But sometimes, we have too much to say to write it on an email. Right? So why not make a video? This is where you may want to use Loom. You simply make a video: you can talk to the camera or sharing what you do on the screen. Or both. When you are done, the video is automatically uploaded. You get a link, you send it. You are notified when the student watches it. It's very convenient. In a way, this is the equivalent of an informal conversation. With Loom, you are not going to edit the video like you would in Final Cut Pro. Make it simple and quick. Like you would if a student would come and ask you a question. On top of that, you have an iPad app , but there is also a Google add-on which means it is fully integrated into Gmail for instance. This is so handy: you click on the little icon, share your screen and you still appear in a circle so students see you. If you want to learn more about feedback, please read this document . But I want to reaffirm the importance of it in the context of remote learning. And Google Docs is great for that too. Make them write as much as possible. Receive feedback \u29eb Finally, I like the idea of asking students for feedback, to ask them how satisfied they are. That way, you can improve your work. We all had at some point to shift online and to learn a new way of doing our job. Students can help. Assessment \u29eb How to assess online? If you have to, I suggest you use Google Docs or Exam.net . But first, let me say this to you. I recently read this article from the Washington Post about cheating detection softwares, and the least I can tell is that it is simply appalling. I just can\u2019t believe one is ready to do in order to prevent academic dishonesty. Please read this article. You will see how stressful it is for students. I hope this excerpt will give you a glimpse of the problem: One system, Proctorio, uses gaze-detection , face-detection and computer-monitoring software to flag students for any \u201cabnormal\u201d head movement , mouse movement , eye wandering , computer window resizing , tab opening , scrolling , clicking , typing , and copies and pastes . A student can be flagged for finishing the test too quickly , or too slowly , clicking too much , or not enough. If the camera sees someone else in the background, a student can be flagged for having \u201c multiple faces detected .\u201d If someone else takes the test on the same network \u2014 say, in a dorm building \u2014 it\u2019s potential \u201c exam collusion .\u201d Room too noisy, Internet too spotty, camera on the fritz? Flag, flag, flag. Students are so afraid to be branded as cheaters that they do not dare leaving their desk: Some students also said they\u2019ve wept with stress or urinated at their desks because they were forbidden from leaving their screens. In my opinion, the only conclusion I came up with is: Is stopping a few cheaters worth the price of treating every student like a fraud? That being said, we want to avoid cheating as much as possible and we want to do that in a respectful and human approach. The second part of my conclusion is: the answer to our problem is not technical. It is pedagogical. We have to rethink the way we assess. Don\u2019t ask a question that can be easily googled. Ask your students to think, not to repeat what they learned (or copied). Anyway, from an IT standpoint only, I can recommend the use of Google Docs and Exam.net. You can provide these guidelines to your students. Using Google Docs \u29eb Work on a shared Google Docs (so you can check from time to time). No copy and paste in this doc (if you suddenly see 30 lines appear, it may be suspicious). Warn students you\u2019ll check history. Use some antiplagiarism tools (more on that down below). Students have to keep cameras on all times (using Zoom or Google Meet). So you can check from to time to time. Sometimes parents are willing to help to monitor their child. Using Exam.net \u29eb Exam.net was free until the end of this year. It's really a great online platform to assess students' work. Here are some of the key features: Student is prevented from copy/pasting anything during the exam. The student\u2019s device is locked to the exam environment or the teacher is notified when a student leaves the app. Like in Google Docs, the teacher can monitor the progress during the exam and see the history of how the student\u2019s text has evolved. The teacher can control the time of the exam (when it ends for instance, you can limit the time, force the submission). There is a built-in antiplagiarism tool ( Urkund ). You can anonymise the exam (student\u2019s identities are replaced by a code, and you may reveal the identities after grading the exam. Exam.net can be used together with several videoconferencing solutions (Meet, Teams...). It can monitor what the student does on the device while the video solution monitors what happens at the student\u2019s location. To be honest, I haven't tried this (but I will). Checking academic honesty \u29eb If you have any doubt about the honesty with which a work has been done, you may be happy to find some plagiarism detection tools. Turnitin PlagScan Dupli Checker Plagium Plagiarism Checker Quetext Plagiarism Checker by Grammarly Small SE Tools Prepostseo I was pleased with Quetext or Dupli Checker. They work pretty well. Conclusion \u29eb You can really create a great online learning experience for your students. This is not an easy thing to put in place. It requires organisation and reflection to adapt your teaching to this new way of doing things. But it's a real opportunity to raise important questions related to pedagogy, to find new ways to teach and to probably refine our use of technology. It's also an opportunity to develop the autonomy of your students. Speaking of which, I love this quote from the New York Times : The mantra of online learning is, \u2018Your own time, your own pace, your own path.\u2019 Indeed, teaching online breaks the three rules of classical theatre (unity of action, of time and of place). And instead of seeing that as a problem, we can take advantage of it and imagine new ways of teaching and learning. But don\u2019t expect to do the same thing as usual. There is no point of giving a question that is answered in Google. And everything online takes more time. Therefore, you should be indulgent with yourself and with students. And you probably want to avoid the now-famous \"Zoom fatigue\". By the way, please remember that Zoom is only a small fraction of online teaching! And don't forget to enjoy this experience. This is unique! I\u2019d like to hear from you. Please, share your thought! Tell me what you think on the comments down below! +++ I made this article available in HackMD . It means that: You can read this article and even copy and paste the all text formatted in Markdown. You can view it in Slides mode. It's a little bit like a PowerPoint presentation. Don't forget you have vertical and horizontal slides as well. Use the keyboard \u2190\u2191\u2193\u2192 to select which slide you want to jump to. You can select Book mode.

This is an online lesson planning tool. In the video ( An Introduction to the Learning Designer ), Eileen Kennedy shows you how to create a learning design. You can find the Learning Designer at ucl.ac.uk . Create an account and create a new design using the Designer. To learn more about this, please read the Learning Designer User Guide . Or you can just have a look, on the Learning Designer website to understand what this is: This design tool will help with the now urgent process of moving your teaching online. The Learning Designer is an online tool to help teachers and lecturers design teaching and learning activities and share their learning designs with each other. It was developed by a team led by Diana Laurillard at the UCL Knowledge Lab, with ESRC funding, and is free for anyone to use. The tool is based on the six learning types from Diana Laurillard\u2019s Conversational Framework \u2013 a model of the conditions necessary for learning to take place. The six learning types are: Read/Write/Listen (or Acquisition), Inquiry, Practice, Production, Discussion and Collaboration. In principle, a good learning design will contain a mix of all of these types of learning. [...] The tool provides feedback on your design by showing you (a) the amount of learning time you have designed, and (b) a pie chart of the proportion of each of the six learning types in your design. You decide what adjustments to make. In principle, a good learning design will contain a mix of all of these types of learning. The Analysis tab also shows the proportions of time learners spend online, with the teacher present, and as a class, group or individual. This is a great way to design your lesson plans. Unfortunately, if the Learning design tool can easily be shared, keep in mind this is not a collaborative tool. Actually, a teacher can design his or her lesson plan, can share it with a colleague, but you will have no option but to make a copy of the shared document, work on it. It will then be yours and the colleague won\u2019t see any change you made. Hopefully, Fran\u00e7ois Jourde and Erwan Gallenne built an awesome spreadsheet facilitating collaboration .

Warm-up activities or ice-breakers are of paramount importance these days. It is also very important to make sure that every student is paying attention, is getting focused. That's why I strongly recommend task-based work. If students only have to listen during all day, teaching may happen but learning? That's why we do have to design our lessons by following, for instance, Diana Laurillard\u2019s framework. But you can also make your lesson a little bit more interactive by offering quizzes. A lot of teachers start their lesson with a simple and quick quiz to engage students. It can be a set of simple questions scheduled in Google Classroom about the previous lesson or a Kahoot , just to check if everyone is understanding what has previously been done. Kahoot offers some kind of gamification which is always fun. Anyway, the point is to keep students active, to interact with them. To do that, you have plenty of options. We mentioned Classroom, Kahoot, but there is Pear Deck , Nearpod , Quizlet ... You name it! It is also important to regularly interact with them individually, to just call them by their name, etc. To finish this part, I want to stress the importance of communication. Please refer to my presentation made at the beginning of the Year ( Communication first ). In fact, online learning raises a series of questions. I quote myself (\ud83d\ude03): How, despite the distance, we keep building a strong relationship with our students? How can we make sure our students have a strong connection together so they can help each other? How can we foster collaboration? Indeed, a lot of things we used to do when we were all gathered in a room seem now impossible to do online. Well, this is not entirely true. Tell your students: \"You are not alone\" or \"I can help you in many ways\". So I would like to show two very simple examples of how to create interactions. We will also see that we can foster peer collaboration during online teaching.","title":"Engage the passive students"},{"location":"Documentation/Online%20Learning/Everything%20you%20need%20to%20know%20to%20teach%20Online/#google-classroom","text":"In Google Classroom, just remind your students to write a comment if they don\u2019t understand something.

Google describes this service this way: Google Groups allows you to create and participate in online forums and email-based groups with a rich experience for community conversations. So, basically, you create an email address (for instance group@schooladdress.com ) and every member of this group receives the message that has been written by any member. Why do that? Well, during the past few years, I was sorry to see that the answer I gave to a student only benefited the student who asked the question. I was thinking: Wouldn't it be great if everyone could receive the answer? Google Groups is a great way to ask a question to the class (but of course you can use Classroom if you prefer): did you understand that? When do you want to do this? It\u2019s also a great way to foster collaboration and to make your students interact together a little bit like in a forum. This year, I'm more than pleased to see very young students helping each other. And most of the time, I don't even need to answer questions. Students do and they do this in the most cordial way. I'm really impressed.

Some students don\u2019t dare to raise their hand but some others fear that you may make fun of their spelling if they are too shy to speak out loud and choose to write to you. You have to reassure them and say: \u201cWe are here to help you, not to assess you based on your spelling skills\u201d. And, as we are all online, written communication becomes more frequent. But sometimes, we have too much to say to write it on an email. Right? So why not make a video? This is where you may want to use Loom. You simply make a video: you can talk to the camera or sharing what you do on the screen. Or both. When you are done, the video is automatically uploaded. You get a link, you send it. You are notified when the student watches it. It's very convenient. In a way, this is the equivalent of an informal conversation. With Loom, you are not going to edit the video like you would in Final Cut Pro. Make it simple and quick. Like you would if a student would come and ask you a question. On top of that, you have an iPad app , but there is also a Google add-on which means it is fully integrated into Gmail for instance. This is so handy: you click on the little icon, share your screen and you still appear in a circle so students see you. If you want to learn more about feedback, please read this document .

If you have to, I suggest you use Google Docs or Exam.net . But first, let me say this to you. I recently read this article from the Washington Post about cheating detection softwares, and the least I can tell is that it is simply appalling. I just can\u2019t believe one is ready to do in order to prevent academic dishonesty. Please read this article. You will see how stressful it is for students. I hope this excerpt will give you a glimpse of the problem: One system, Proctorio, uses gaze-detection , face-detection and computer-monitoring software to flag students for any \u201cabnormal\u201d head movement , mouse movement , eye wandering , computer window resizing , tab opening , scrolling , clicking , typing , and copies and pastes . A student can be flagged for finishing the test too quickly , or too slowly , clicking too much , or not enough. If the camera sees someone else in the background, a student can be flagged for having \u201c multiple faces detected .\u201d If someone else takes the test on the same network \u2014 say, in a dorm building \u2014 it\u2019s potential \u201c exam collusion .\u201d Room too noisy, Internet too spotty, camera on the fritz? Flag, flag, flag. Students are so afraid to be branded as cheaters that they do not dare leaving their desk: Some students also said they\u2019ve wept with stress or urinated at their desks because they were forbidden from leaving their screens. In my opinion, the only conclusion I came up with is: Is stopping a few cheaters worth the price of treating every student like a fraud? That being said, we want to avoid cheating as much as possible and we want to do that in a respectful and human approach. The second part of my conclusion is: the answer to our problem is not technical. It is pedagogical. We have to rethink the way we assess. Don\u2019t ask a question that can be easily googled. Ask your students to think, not to repeat what they learned (or copied). Anyway, from an IT standpoint only, I can recommend the use of Google Docs and Exam.net.

Speaking of which, I love this quote from the New York Times : The mantra of online learning is, \u2018Your own time, your own pace, your own path.\u2019 Indeed, teaching online breaks the three rules of classical theatre (unity of action, of time and of place). And instead of seeing that as a problem, we can take advantage of it and imagine new ways of teaching and learning. But don\u2019t expect to do the same thing as usual. There is no point of giving a question that is answered in Google. And everything online takes more time. Therefore, you should be indulgent with yourself and with students. And you probably want to avoid the now-famous \"Zoom fatigue\". By the way, please remember that Zoom is only a small fraction of online teaching! And don't forget to enjoy this experience.

Family Link is a service from Google that offers several parental controls. It doesn't matter if, as a parent, you have an iPhone or an Android . You can download an app available both on the App Store and Google Play and supervise your child usage of an Android device. All you need is a Google Account. In this tutorial, we won't cover the whole process but you need to know that you can create a Google account for your child using Family Link and manage it. Be aware that you can't use the email provided by the school. The address must be a Gmail account (ending in @gmail.com). What can you do with Family Link? \u29eb You can do many things with the Family Link app. For instance, you can control what your child can or cannot download on Google Play depending on your child's age. You can use filters on Google Chrome and block certain websites. You can restrict content on YouTube, etc. But the features I use the most are the ones down below. Screen time \u29eb You can check screen time and see how much time your child has spent on his/her device. You'll see what apps the child has been using and for how long. Pick an app to display more details. You can then forbid the use of the app or modify the app permissions (access to the camera, to contacts or to storage, etc.). You can also tap on the little timer to display more options. Of course, you can exclude apps from time limits you have set. Location \u29eb Unless the device is offline, you can check the location of the device (it also appears in Google Maps on your device) and find your child when she or he is on the go. You can also use Family Link to play a sound on a phone you lost so you can find it (scroll down, locate your child's device, press Settings or Play sound ). Note that if the device is lost or has been stolen, you can remotely delete data (in Device details , press Reset device and delete data ). Lock or Unlock \u29eb You can lock or unlock the device. If you decide that too much time has been spent on the phone, you can simply lock the device. Or you can simply add a bonus time of a few minutes. After that, the device is automatically locked. Set limits \u29eb You can set a daily limit (say two hours per day) and even schedule bedtime (your child won't be able to use the device after 8 p.m. for instance).

Do you think they spend too much time checking their email and that it takes too long to get back to the task? Of course, as they need their iPad, they can\u2019t simply turn it off. But some very simple things can be done so students stay focused. Mute all sounds on the iPad or turn off notifications will eliminate a lot of distractions. On top of that, we have to make sure students come with a fully charged iPad at the beginning of the day. But, if they need to charge it during the day, they will need a power bank . By doing so, no student has to interrupt their work to find an outlet nor find themselves with an empty battery, giving them no choice but to stop working. So, mute the iPad, turn off notifications, bring a fully charged device and a power bank. That will help. Here\u2019s how. Turn off Sound \u29eb Why muting the iPad? Well, that\u2019s pretty self-explanatory. In my class, I don\u2019t want twenty or thirty iPads to make a noise every time students get a notification (it can be a new email from another teacher or a Google Classroom notification when a new assignment has been posted). To do that, the easiest solution is to toggle on Silent mode by swiping down from the top right corner to access the Control Center. Then tap on the bell icon to mute the iPad. No sound will disturb your speech, but notifications still draw attention from the students. So we have to do more. Do not disturb \u29eb To avoid any distraction during the class, I also ask students to turn Do Not Disturb on. It means that calls and notifications will be silent so they can stay focused. How to turn Do Not Disturb on? There are two ways to turn it on. First, you can go to Settings and activate Do Not Disturb . Or you can open Control center by swiping down your screen from the upper-right corner and press the crescent moon. \u26a0\ufe0f You can silence your device while it is locked, which is quite handy when you don\u2019t want to be bothered by notifications at the end of the day. But as a teacher, I am mainly interested in this possibility: avoid any notifications while using the iPad. To do that, tap on Always . From now on, no notification will prevent students from being completely focused on their task. Automation \u29eb Problem is, all of this requires manual activation and students can always forget (or pretend to forget). And how can you blame them for this? One always forgets something. Automation will get rid of this issue. The iPad will never forget. So, we are going to ask the iPad: when I arrive at this location, turn off sound and turn on Silent mode. All of this automatically. To do that, launch Shortcuts . Choose Automation , then Create Personal Automation . We want this to be automatically done when we arrive at a specific location. So when creating your automation, select Arrive . Choose a location (our school is located at 54 Forty Lane, London). And also choose Time range so the automation is triggered both by location and at a specific time only. Now, we are going to select the actions we want to run. To do that, tap on the + button and type the first letters of Set Do Not Disturb then Set Volume . Set volume to zero. Now, press Next and Done . And you\u2019re good to go! Every time you arrive at this location, this automation will (automatically of course) set Do not disturb and mute the iPad. You don\u2019t even have to think about it. Of course, students love to be disturbed by their notifications. So, from time to time, you\u2019ll have to check if they comply with this. Now, let\u2019s consider another recurrent source of distraction: the search for energy. Charge your iPad \u29eb If need be, remind your students that they bring a fully charged iPad. We don\u2019t have a socket for each student and, because of the restrictions due to the coronavirus, we don\u2019t want them to move throughout the classroom to find one and be too close from another student. Therefore, they have to charge the battery before coming to school. They have to bring the charger as well! It may be useful if they are near a socket. But bringing a power bank is a good idea too. You can find some of them on Amazon at a pretty good price: the Anker PowerCore Essential or the AUKEY 20000mAh Power Bank cost approximately \u00a320. And don\u2019t forget to use Apple Classroom to check from time to time what students are doing on their device. If you don\u2019t know how to do that, please read the tutorial dedicated to this app.","title":"How to avoid distraction from the iPad during class"},{"location":"Documentation/Parents/How%20to%20avoid%20distraction%20from%20the%20iPad%20during%20class/#turn-off-sound","text":"Why muting the iPad?

And while you may be happy that they are provided with an appropriate ICT education, you may have some concerns about what they will be doing with their new device: will your children do their homework? Will they be watching YouTube videos or playing games for long hours? As a matter of fact, maybe, as a parent, you feel that you are completely blind and unaware of how the iPad is being used by your children. And surely you want to know how you can keep control of that or check from time to time their screen usage! So I would like to help by providing some advice about how to monitor your child\u2019s iPad. And to do that, you may use Screen Time. Among other things. Screen Time \u29eb Screen Time is a feature launched in 2018 in iOS 12. It records the amount of time a user spends on apps or websites. Screen Time also provides blocking features to limit the usage of apps or set restrictions. 1. Turn on Screen Time directly on a device \u29eb There are two ways you can set up Screen Time controls. This is the first one. On your child\u2019s device, go to Settings > Screen Time and tap Turn On Screen Time . Tap Continue . Select This is My Child's [device] . For now, you can skip the few following steps, but, of course, setting a passcode will avoid the settings to be bypassed. 2. Turn on Screen Time through Family Sharing \u29eb But in my opinion, if you already possess your own iPad or iPhone, the best option is to first create an Apple ID for your child. To do that, you need Family Sharing 1 . This is the second method to set up Screen Time. On your device, go to Settings and tap on your name. Then choose Family Sharing and Add Family Member . Tap on Create a Child Account and follow the instructions. So your child will have an Apple ID and be a part of the Family Sharing but most importantly you will be able to manage your child\u2019s screen usage within Screen Time from your own device. It means that all controls are located on your device. You can then control apps your children are using. You can access your children's Activity Report to understand where they spend their time and you can set App Limits... How to use Screen Time \u29eb In Settings, you can manage: Downtime App Limits Communication Limits Always allowed Content & Privacy Restrictions 1. Downtime \u29eb Scheduling downtime means that it\u2019s time to go to bed or do something else away from the screen. During downtime, if your child tries to use the iPad, he or she gets a message informing that it\u2019s scheduled downtime. If your child tries to access their device during downtime, they can request more time from you. 2. App Limits \u29eb Set the amount of time per day that you want your child to spend on certain categories of apps (Games, Entertainment, Productivity, Social Networking, etc.). You may have noticed from the screenshots above that I have only selected one category. As a matter of fact, I suggest you do the same and apply limits category by category. Of course, you can select everything and say that your child won\u2019t use the iPad more than 1 or 2 hours per day or maybe half an hour and no more on the tablet. But if you want to change something, you\u2019ll have to erase all your settings and start over. Or if you want your child to spend only 30 minutes on YouTube but 1 hour on Books, it\u2019s much more convenient to have settings category by category and therefore to add a new limit. You can apply limits to apps but you can also add limits to websites as well. 3. Communication Limits \u29eb You can set communication limits which only apply to Phone, FaceTime, Messages and iCloud contacts. So you can control who your children can communicate with. This can be with everyone or with people in your contacts. As Apple warns, \u201cCommunication to known emergency numbers identified by your carrier is always allowed.\u201d 4. Always Allowed \u29eb Specific apps, even if it's downtime or if you set the All Apps & Categories app limit, are always available. This could be Messages or FaceTime and, of course, Phone so that your child we\u2019ll be able to reach you no matter what. 5. Content & Privacy Restrictions \u29eb We use a Mobile Device Management to create and install configuration profiles which means that, thanks to these profiles, some apps are blacklisted, some words or some websites are forbidden. But you can block inappropriate content as well. You can also prevent your child to purchase or download apps. All you have to do is to toggle on the Content & Privacy Restrictions button. You can do a lot of things in that section. We won\u2019t cover everything but you might be interested in knowing that you can create a website whitelist by allowing only specific websites to be seen, for instance. To do that, go to Content Restrictions > Web Content > Allowed Websites Only > Add Website . Cut off your Wi-Fi network \u29eb There are simple things to do to prevent your children from using their iPad late at night. You can simply ask them to turn off their device at say 9 p.m. Even ask them to put it in a box outside their bedroom for the night. While this can be a little bit tricky (a child is a hard bargainer when it comes to getting extra time to do whatever he or she needs to do with his or her device), remember your provider (Virgin, BT, EE and so forth) gave you a box you can access to limit the usage of a specific device. As a matter of fact, you can simply cut off the wifi for your children at a specific hour while you can still have it for your own device. The way of doing that is not always user-friendly but let me explain how to do it. Unfortunately, I can only get my examples from my own provider which is Virgin Media. However, things shouldn\u2019t be much different from your own box. First of all, open up your favourite browser and type the IP address of your box. This should be something like 192.168.0.1 or maybe 192.168.1.1 . Then you are asked to provide your credentials login (username and password). Most of the time, they are located right under your box on a sticker. If you are a customer of Virgin Media go to Advanced settings > Wireless > MAC filtering . As you probably have guessed, you are going to filter the access of your network by giving the MAC address of the device for which you want to restrict internet access. It\u2019s very simple. Again, let me explain it. A device has a name (whatever you want) and it has a MAC address which is a sequence of letters and numbers separated by colons. It is a unique identifier assigned by the device manufacturers. There are many ways to find it but you should be able to get it as you may see on the screenshot. So, to block internet traffic to a specific device, you are simply going to add a filter rule by giving the name of the device and the MAC address of the device. Eventually, you may want to specify when you want this new rule to apply (say from 9 p.m. to 6 a.m.). Educate \u29eb We saw in the two previous sections of this article that you can prevent your child from doing this or that but, instead of blocking apps or websites, the best option is probably to educate your children and explain what they should and shouldn\u2019t do. In my opinion, we can\u2019t control everything and I am not sure this is entirely feasible nor desirable. Furthermore, please, keep in mind that setting restrictions can be a problem for your child. Indeed, imagine that you set the amount of time per day that you want your child to spend on YouTube (say half an hour) and a teacher asks students to watch a full documentary during the class. Your child will have no other option to ask for your permission and if he or she can\u2019t contact you, he or she won\u2019t be able to do the work that has been assigned. Therefore, I do believe we need to put some rules in place but first, we must talk with our children and probably trust them in the first place. To begin with, we may grant them great liberty in the use they make of their iPad, and if and only if they take advantage of this liberty, maybe we should consider setting restrictions.

Both teachers and students have an iPad. And, to make things done, we rely on two main things: G Suite and Pronote. iPad \u29eb We give our students an iPad. In fact, the iPad belongs to the school and is a pedagogical tool only. This is why games are not accepted. As a matter of fact, iPads are monitored by the IT department and we know what is installed on the device. To do that, we use Jamf , a software for the Apple platform simplifying IT management. For instance, we can buy apps in bulk and push them up on all devices at the same time. Or we can restrict access to some websites or even apps. We may forbid changing this or that settings and so forth. I will cover security settings in the next session. For now, I would like to remind you that it is wise to subscribe insurance. It cost \u00a330 a year. To subscribe to an insurance , you will need to know where to find the serial number of the device. To do that, go to Settings > General > About . I would also like to highlight the fact that the iPad is a powerful device but it takes time to master it, especially since iOS became iPad OS 13. Moreover, the iPad has a multiplicity of input systems. It is a hybrid machine that can adapt to the context you\u2019re using it: you may use your finger, you may add a Bluetooth keyboard or you may choose the stylus. There is great flexibility which serves different purposes: browse or multitask swiftly, take note, scribble something or even draw, edit a long text document... If you need help with any of this, I would be more than happy to help. Meanwhile, if you want to learn more so that you can improve your child skills, you may read some of these articles: iPadOS brings many new features, and here are the best ones! iOS 13 and iPadOS 13: How to use the new gestures for cut, copy, paste, undo and redo (video) Secrets to multitasking like a pro in iPadOS 13 Here\u2019s how multiple app spaces and App Expos\u00e9 work on iPad with iPadOS 13 (great topic to know more about Split Screen, Slide Over, Expos\u00e9 and so forth) iOS and iPadOS 13: The MacStories Review (a very long but exhaustive and exciting review) 10 ways iOS 13\u2019s Reminders app can turn you into a productivity beast (everything you need to know about the new Reminders app) iPadOS Preview: Files app, USB Storage, SMB Shares (video) iPadOS Preview: Desktop-class Safari, Download Manager, and more! (video) How to Enable Dark Mode in iOS 13 or iOS 12 on iPhone and iPad G Suite for Education \u29eb This is a free suite of many software and products developed by Google. You probably know most these applications: Gmail, Docs, Sheets, Slides, and so on. But you may wondering what is the difference between G Suite for Education and Google's free apps. First, with G Suite, you'll receive a number of additional services which are not included with Google's free consumer apps.

In fact, the iPad belongs to the school and is a pedagogical tool only. This is why games are not accepted. As a matter of fact, iPads are monitored by the IT department and we know what is installed on the device. To do that, we use Jamf , a software for the Apple platform simplifying IT management. For instance, we can buy apps in bulk and push them up on all devices at the same time. Or we can restrict access to some websites or even apps. We may forbid changing this or that settings and so forth. I will cover security settings in the next session. For now, I would like to remind you that it is wise to subscribe insurance. It cost \u00a330 a year. To subscribe to an insurance , you will need to know where to find the serial number of the device. To do that, go to Settings > General > About . I would also like to highlight the fact that the iPad is a powerful device but it takes time to master it, especially since iOS became iPad OS 13. Moreover, the iPad has a multiplicity of input systems. It is a hybrid machine that can adapt to the context you\u2019re using it: you may use your finger, you may add a Bluetooth keyboard or you may choose the stylus. There is great flexibility which serves different purposes: browse or multitask swiftly, take note, scribble something or even draw, edit a long text document... If you need help with any of this, I would be more than happy to help.

Je vous encourage \u00e0 regarder cette courte vid\u00e9o pour comprendre ce qu\u2019est Pix. Mais si vous voulez davantage de pr\u00e9cision, je vous invite \u00e0 lire les lignes qui suivent. La certification Pix s\u2019appuie sur le cadre de r\u00e9f\u00e9rence des comp\u00e9tences num\u00e9riques (CRCN) qui donne lieu \u00e0 une certification obligatoire des comp\u00e9tences num\u00e9riques en fin de cycle 4 au coll\u00e8ge et au cycle terminal du lyc\u00e9e d\u00e8s l\u2019ann\u00e9e prochaine. Ce dispositif (\u00e9valuations et certification) se substitue au brevet informatique et internet (B2i). Le CRCN \u2014 et donc Pix \u00e9galement \u2014 s\u2019organise en cinq domaines et seize comp\u00e9tences num\u00e9riques. Information et donn\u00e9es (Mener une recherche et une veille d\u2019information, G\u00e9rer des donn\u00e9es, Traiter des donn\u00e9es) Communication et collaboration (Interagir, Partager et publier, Collaborer, S\u2019ins\u00e9rer dans le monde num\u00e9rique) Cr\u00e9ation de contenus (D\u00e9velopper des documents textuels, D\u00e9velopper des documents multim\u00e9dia, Adapter les documents \u00e0 leur finalit\u00e9, Programmer) Protection et s\u00e9curit\u00e9 (S\u00e9curiser l\u2019environnement num\u00e9rique, Prot\u00e9ger les donn\u00e9es personnelles et la vie priv\u00e9e, Prot\u00e9ger la sant\u00e9, le bien-\u00eatre et l\u2019environnement) Environnement num\u00e9rique (R\u00e9soudre des probl\u00e8mes techniques, \u00c9voluer dans un environnement num\u00e9rique) Pour chaque comp\u00e9tence, six niveaux de ma\u00eetrise progressive sont propos\u00e9s. Ces comp\u00e9tences font l\u2019objet d\u2019une certification d\u00e9livr\u00e9e par la plateforme Pix . L\u2019\u00e9preuve de certification dure 1h45. Pour passer cette certification, les \u00e9l\u00e8ves doivent d\u2019abord cr\u00e9er un profil Pix et atteindre au moins cinq comp\u00e9tences au niveau 1 sur les seize susmentionn\u00e9es. Pour r\u00e9ussir cette \u00e9preuve, les \u00e9l\u00e8ves s\u2019entra\u00eenent, acqui\u00e8rent des comp\u00e9tences seuls ou accompagn\u00e9s par leurs professeurs, chez eux ou dans leur \u00e9tablissement, sur la plateforme Pix . L\u2019\u00e9preuve de certification contiendra 3 questions par comp\u00e9tence travaill\u00e9e . Les \u00e9l\u00e8ves devront donc r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 un nombre de questions compris entre 15 \u00e0 48, suivant leur avancement sur leur profil Pix (5 \u00e0 16 comp\u00e9tences travaill\u00e9es).

You don\u2019t have your iPad and you don\u2019t know your credentials? Don\u2019t worry! Please find on this document everything you need in order to start the year. Anyway, you will learn a lot with your teachers during the year. Therefore, you just have to know how to log in into your Google account and how to use Zoom . \ud83c\udd98 If you need any help, send a message to IT Support . We will be there to help you solve any problem you have. 1. Log in to your Google account \u29eb \ud83d\udcbb To begin with, you need a computer or a tablet. If you don\u2019t have one, ask your parents. 1.1 Open up your browser \u29eb The first thing to do is to log in to your Google account. To do that, launch your favorite browser (Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Edge...), and go to Google . Click on the big blue button on the upper right corner (Sign in). 1.2 What are my credentials? \u29eb You need your credentials, that is to say an email address and a password . 1.2.1 Your address \u29eb Your email address is your first name followed by the initial of your name and then @lyceechurchill.london .

It is called the G Suite . The G Suite \u29eb Google Classroom \u29eb Classroom is probably the app we use the most at school. Your teachers will assign activities using Google Classroom. You will also use this app to send them back your work. To do that, go to Classroom in your browser. \ud83d\udca1 If you have an iPad, you can download the app on the App Store . If you have an Android tablet, you can also download it on Google Play . \ud83d\ude42 As you can see in the above screenshot, you need a code. At the beginning of each class, your teacher will provide you a code made of a mixture of five to seven letters and digits. For instance, your Math teacher will give it to you when he or she will need you to have a particular document or that you you have to send something. Please, feel free to ask your teacher how to do that! The other applications \u29eb We use a lot of the G Suite apps: Googles Docs, Sheets, Slide, etc. You will learn to master them on a daily basis. Zoom \u29eb We are using Zoom to see you, talk to you and give you instructions. So you need to connect to Zoom. Hopefully, it is a very simple thing to do because you are going to use you Google credentials. Remember? We talked about this before.\u261d\ufe0f If you have an iPad, download the app .

Zoom for Teachers Tutorial \u29eb I was doing some research and I ended up on YouTube watching this video ZOOM for Teachers Tutorial . Nothing new but the tips shared by the host are interesting and important. You probably already know all of them but they are worth remembering it. For example, the tutorial explains how to engage your audience by talking to people and looking at people . Not your screen. It means you have to look at the camera. Makes sense? It\u2019s a little bit strange but effective. Multiple Sharing \u29eb It occurred to me (thanks, Gerard) that you could ask all participants to share their screen at the same time . It\u2019s a wonderful feature that would be tremendously helpful but we can not (unless I missed something) use it on mobile devices. I asked for it in a possible future release . Fingers crossed. I recommend you do the same by the way. The more people are asking, the better. If you want to learn more about Multiple Screen Share, please have a look at: Zoom Help center (Sharing multiple screens in a Zoom Room) Sharing multiple screens simultaneously (Zoom Help Center) Zoom Multiple Screen Share IPEVO \u29eb I also read 11 Benefits To Enhance Your Remote Teaching . I\u2019m very interested in IPEVO, a multi-angle arm for smartphones you can buy on Amazon for \u00a359. It\u2019s a little bit expensive but useful: you can show documents but you can also use the arm to use the camera of your phone to display your face on Zoom. The camera of your iPad is quite good (but too low). The camera of your Mac, if you use one, is terrible. Avoid that one! Anyway, the arm is interesting. In the aforementioned article, you can watch how to use it with IPEVO \u2018s software. Again, it\u2019s pretty expensive but definitely interesting. However, you can also transform your iPhone into a document viewer with Overview . I found this app by reading Overviewer turns your iPhone into a document camera for Zoom calls | iMore . It\u2019s free and may be useful if you want to share a paperback or any document of the \u201creal\u201d world. The Verge is also mentioning the app. But if you just want an adjustable Cell Phone Holder, consider this cheaper alternative (\u00a315.99). Or this one (\u00a38.99). And, of course, there are plenty of Zoom hacks to join a session using a second device as a document camera/visualiser . \ud83d\ude04 Get rid of this annoying noise \u29eb Sorry! But this article is in French but all you have to know is that, if you use a Mac, you can download this free software \u201cthat mutes your microphone while you type . No more getting called out for clacking your way through a Zoom meeting on your clicky keyboard!\u201d. Backgrounds \u29eb Last but not least, backgrounds. You probably use one to hide whatever you want to hide. Remember? You can download any image you want to use as a background . If you can\u2019t use virtual background because your computer is too old and doesn\u2019t meet the system requirements, you still have the possibility to use this cheap background for Zoom . But you don\u2019t have to choose between showing yourself and your presentation. Did you know you could display your PowerPoint presentation in the background ? On your computer, simply go to Share Screen > Advanced > Slides as Virtual Background .","title":"About Zoom and remote learning"},{"location":"Documentation/Zoom/About%20Zoom%20and%20remote%20learning/#zoom-for-teachers-tutorial","text":"I was doing some research and I ended up on YouTube watching this video ZOOM for Teachers Tutorial .

All you have to do is to follow those few steps. First, you have to download a book. For instance, you can legally and freely download a .mobi file on Project Gutenberg website. Then you have to send it to your kindle. In order to do that, you have to know the Send-to-Kindle e-mail address . To find out what it is, go to the Manage Your Devices page on Amazon. You will find your device and by clicking on the three dots on the left, you will find the address. You have one more step: add a trusted e-mail account (visit the Personal Document Settings page at Manage Your Kindle ).

But for whatever reason it is, when they have to deliver content to their students, their first choice is a Word document, a PDF or maybe a website such as Google site, not a book. To be honest, I have not the faintest idea why. But you should give it a try. Write your first ePub (short for /electronic publication/), the standard digital format for ebooks ? I promise you, you are going to enjoy it. As it is a standard, ePubs can be read anywhere: on a PC, on a Mac, on an Android tablet or even better an e-reader, which offer great comfort for your eyes. Why ePubs? \u29eb Think about it. When you do, students get great rich content. In an ePub, students will be able to: Use the built-in dictionary. Highlights what they find important. They will be able to take notes and even export them. They can change the font or increase the font size if they want (handy for those who are dyslexic). Disable students will be able to take advantage of Speak Selection which can read the text to you. On top of that, you can insert audio content and even videos to your ePub. You can even find software allowing you to insert quizzes in your book. In addition, if you provide an ePub with all the content say for the next week or maybe the next term, you won\u2019t rely on the wifi anymore. Students download their digital book. They have it on their tablet or computer. So if the connection fails, students still have access to your content and learning can still happen. So ePub is a pretty obvious choice. Go for it. But how can you create an ePub? Is that difficult? How can you read an ePub? And where can you download books? All these questions are answered down below. Most of the time, things are pretty self-explanatory and I wanted to make this short and as simple as possible. In fact, you just write, click Export and that\u2019s it. Moreover, you will find animated GIF so you know how to get things done. Create an ePub with a word processor \u29eb Pages ( iPad & Mac or your web browser .

So let me give you one or two pieces of advice. Where to start? \u29eb The first tip I\u2019d like to give, for this very first book, is to keep things as simple as you can: no fancy font, no exotic colour, reduce a little bit your images so they fit the page format. This advice will be helpful if you plan to create an ePub with a lot of text. And for your first book, don\u2019t bother. Just use a word processor. It\u2019s a great way to start and to be honest, it\u2019s more than enough. I\u2019m not using anything else. Creating a table of contents \u29eb To create a table of contents, just use styles. It will automatically be added to your ePub. Design your cover \u29eb With Pages, you can do pretty much everything. Just have a look. Complicated formatting? \u29eb If you have a pretty complex layout with graphics, tables, columns, large image, then you need to learn something more: the difference between reflowable and fixed-layout ePubs. Apple explains it in a very simple way: Reflowable: if you want your content to accommodate different devices and orientations, choose Reflowable. In a Reflowable EPUB, text size scales and content repaginates according to the reader. Reflowable is best for documents that are mostly text. Fixed layout: if you want the layout of each page in your document to stay the same, regardless of the device or orientation, choose Fixed layout. In a Fixed layout EPUB, users can zoom in and out, but text and content positions are fixed and don't reflow. Fixed layout is best for image-heavy or multi-column documents. You can easily create fixed-layout ePubs with apps like Pages or Book Creator. I strongly recommend these two apps. And do remember that you don\u2019t need a Mac to create your ePub with Pages, you can simply head to https://www.icloud.com/ and edit your ePub in your browser. What if I am a math teacher? \u29eb If you are a math teacher, you\u2019ll probably want to insert mathematical expressions using LaTeX. Actually, this is very easy. In Pages, just press Insert then Equation . You may also use HackMd, an online word processor. You can render LaTeX/mathematical expressions using MathJax . Just insert a $ before and after your formula as shown down below.","title":"What is an ePub file and why you are going to love it"},{"location":"Documentation/ePub/What%20is%20an%20ePub%20file%20and%20why%20you%20are%20going%20to%20love%20it/#whats-an-epub","text":"That is a fact: teachers love books. But for whatever reason it is, when they have to deliver content to their students, their first choice is a Word document, a PDF or maybe a website such as Google site, not a book. To be honest, I have not the faintest idea why. But you should give it a try. Write your first ePub (short for /electronic publication/), the standard digital format for ebooks ? I promise you, you are going to enjoy it. As it is a standard, ePubs can be read anywhere: on a PC, on a Mac, on an Android tablet or even better an e-reader, which offer great comfort for your eyes.","title":"What\u2019s an ePub?"},{"location":"Documentation/ePub/What%20is%20an%20ePub%20file%20and%20why%20you%20are%20going%20to%20love%20it/#why-epubs","text":"Think about it. When you do, students get great rich content. In an ePub, students will be able to: Use the built-in dictionary. Highlights what they find important. They will be able to take notes and even export them. They can change the font or increase the font size if they want (handy for those who are dyslexic). Disable students will be able to take advantage of Speak Selection which can read the text to you. On top of that, you can insert audio content and even videos to your ePub. You can even find software allowing you to insert quizzes in your book. In addition, if you provide an ePub with all the content say for the next week or maybe the next term, you won\u2019t rely on the wifi anymore. Students download their digital book. They have it on their tablet or computer. So if the connection fails, students still have access to your content and learning can still happen. So ePub is a pretty obvious choice. Go for it. But how can you create an ePub? Is that difficult? How can you read an ePub? And where can you download books? All these questions are answered down below. Most of the time, things are pretty self-explanatory and I wanted to make this short and as simple as possible. In fact, you just write, click Export and that\u2019s it.

Et de r\u00e2ler sans savoir quoi faire... En ce qui me concerne, je ne comprends pas un traitre mot au discours qui m\u2019est tenu \u00e0 propos du filtrage du net : il s\u2019agirait d\u2019emp\u00eacher les \u00e9l\u00e8ves (et les enseignants) d\u2019acc\u00e9der \u00e0 des sites qui n\u2019auraient aucun int\u00e9r\u00eat p\u00e9dagogique. Ah !? Parce qu\u2019il y a quelqu\u2019un, quelque part, sachant ce qui rev\u00eat un int\u00e9r\u00eat p\u00e9dagogique ou pas ? Parce que moi je l\u2019ignore (je ne parle \u00e9videmment pas de tout ce que la morale r\u00e9prouve). Peut-on m\u00eame savoir quel chemin l\u2019activit\u00e9 p\u00e9dagogique va-t-elle emprunter ? Moi, je fais feu de tout bois : Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, un obscur blog, un improbable site, tel ou tel forum nourrissent ma r\u00e9flexion et stimulent mon d\u00e9sir d\u2019enseigner. En revanche, quand je tombe sur une page m\u2019expliquant que je n\u2019ai pas le droit d\u2019acc\u00e9der \u00e0 telle page parce que quelqu\u2019un quelque part en a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 ainsi, cela me fait sortir de mes gonds. Je me suis d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu refuser l\u2019acc\u00e8s \u00e0 un site sur la peinture parce qu\u2019on avait pens\u00e9 que ce n\u2019\u00e9tait pas p\u00e9dagogique. Eh quoi ! Rapha\u00ebl ou Waterhouse ne seraient pas p\u00e9dagogiques (si si, \u00e7a m\u2019est arriv\u00e9) ? Et puis s\u2019il fallait prouver que les filtres \u00e9taient inadapt\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9cole, rappelons qu\u2019en d\u00e9pit de leur mise en place, on trouve durant sa navigation sur le web ce qu\u2019il ne faudrait pas, et qu\u2019on y trouve pas ce qu\u2019il faudrait... Bah oui. Pour toutes ces raisons, pour mes coll\u00e8gues auxquels on ne permet pas d\u2019acc\u00e9der \u00e0 leur bo\u00eete mail, aux sites auxquels ils veulent acc\u00e9der et qui sont pourtant d\u2019une innocuit\u00e9 p\u00e9dagogique et morale, voici deux solutions, qu\u2019il ne faut \u00e9videmment pas mettre en \u0153uvre, parce que c\u2019est mal, et que - si je vous le dis - c\u2019est uniquement \u00e0 titre informatif (je ne saurais \u00eatre tenu pour responsable de vos agissements). Tor La premi\u00e8re solution consiste \u00e0 installer Tor sur votre ordinateur. C\u2019est d\u2019une simplicit\u00e9 enfantine, \u00e0 condition d\u2019avoir un plein acc\u00e8s \u00e0 votre machine, et non \u00e0 un espace allou\u00e9 sur un serveur avec des droits limit\u00e9s. Faut-il rappeler que Tor vous permettra d\u2019\u00eatre (relativement) anonyme durant votre navigation sur le web. R\u00e9cemment, j\u2019ai pu encore le v\u00e9rifier en allant sur le site de la CNIL qui pr\u00e9tend pister vos traces (http://www.cnil.fr/vos-libertes/vos-traces/). Avec Tor, comme on peut le voir gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 cette capture d\u2019\u00e9cran, la CNIL pense que mon adresse IP est ... alors que ma v\u00e9ritable adresse est ... (je ne vais quand m\u00eame pas vous donner mon adresse) , et que je viens de ... ! Je ne sais pas si je deviens parano, mais j\u2019aime de moins en moins laisser des traces de mon parcours sur internet, notamment depuis que j\u2019ai lu ces quelques articles : http://www.numerama.com/magazine/19103-pour-la-cnil-facebook-et-google-sont-des-big-brother-conviviaux.html, http://www.numerama.com/magazine/19067-41-pays-approuvent-le-rapport-de-l-onu-sur-la-liberte-et-internet-pas-la-france.html, etc. D\u2019ailleurs, Tor installe pour Firefox une s\u00e9rie de plugins destin\u00e9s aux plus paranos d\u2019entre nous : NoScript, BetterPrivacy, HTTPS-Everywhere. \u00c9videmment, tout cela n\u2019est pas nouveau. Cela fait bien longtemps que l\u2019on nous invite \u00e0 la prudence.

Ouvrez le Terminal et faites un ping afin d\u2019obtenir l\u2019adresse IP du site que vous voulez consulter. ![[Terminal.png]] Vous devez ensuite convertir l\u2019adresse IP en binaire, soit convertir les quatre num\u00e9ros en num\u00e9ro binaire \u00e0 8 chiffres. Enfin, il ne manque plus qu\u2019\u00e0 r\u00e9unir tout cela en un nombre binaire \u00e0 trente-deux chiffres, puis \u00e0 le convertir en un nombre d\u00e9cimal. ![[IP.jpg]] ![[Binaire.jpg]] ![[D\u00e9cimal.jpg]] Si vous n\u2019avez pas eu le temps de r\u00e9viser ces petites pirouettes num\u00e9riques, je vous recommande le logiciel IP-Calculator (que je viens de trouver sur l\u2019App Store). Vous n\u2019avez pas de Mac, vous n\u2019aimez pas le Terminal ?

On voit, chez le moraliste toujours (http://www.ralentirtravaux.com/lettres/textes/poemes/mouche-fourmi.php), combien le mis\u00e9rable insecte est de surcro\u00eet gonfl\u00e9 d\u2019orgueil ! S\u2019il est vrai que la mouche peut s\u2019av\u00e9rer \u00eatre un redoutable adversaire que pas m\u00eame la force l\u00e9onine ne peut vaincre, tout porte \u00e0 croire qu\u2019elle s\u2019efforce pourtant de rechercher inlassablement un but unique : se faire exploser \u00e0 coups de tapette si opportun\u00e9ment dite \u00e0 mouches . Depuis que je vis \u00e0 la campagne, du printemps \u00e0 l\u2019automne, il n\u2019est pas un instant qui ne me fait d\u00e9plorer la si vaine existence du dipt\u00e8re (pr\u00e9cisons que d\u2019aucuns - pour rester dans les bornes \u00e9troites de la politesse - disent \u00ab sodomiser les dipt\u00e8res \u00bb pour \u00ab enculer les mouches \u00bb, improbable pr\u00e9occupation qui a pourtant ses adeptes... ). Pas un jour, disais-je, qui ne me fait regretter l\u2019inopportun insecte : il vrombit syst\u00e9matiquement au plus pr\u00e8s de mes tympans lorsque je tente de lire un livre ou de travailler sur mon ordinateur. En ces p\u00e9riodes troubl\u00e9es, je ne peux d\u2019ailleurs pas regarder une vache dans les yeux. J\u2019y vois le d\u00e9sespoir morne et r\u00e9sign\u00e9 de l\u2019animal envahi, qui n\u2019a pas su inventer la tapette ou le papier tue-mouches pendouillant si in\u00e9l\u00e9gamment dans nos cuisines.Chaque fois que la mouche se rappelle \u00e0 mon bon souvenir, je m\u2019\u00e9tonne de l\u2019opini\u00e2tret\u00e9 de celle-ci : aussit\u00f4t chass\u00e9e, elle revient derechef. Je voudrais alors que la formule jupit\u00e9rienne (disons sartrienne) ait la capacit\u00e9 de chasser ce symbole du remords : \u00ab Abraxas, galla, galla, ts\u00e9, ts\u00e9 \u00bb. Mais rien n\u2019y fait. Alors je frappe, petit Jupiter \u00e0 tapette \u00e0 mouches (celle dont le milieu est orn\u00e9 d\u2019un visage et dont le rictus ridicule saisit l\u2019ennemi foudroy\u00e9 au moment de la mise \u00e0 mort), je frappe et frappe jusqu\u2019\u00e0 \u00e9visc\u00e9rer mes proies. C\u2019est une h\u00e9catombe de petits boyaux qui s\u2019\u00e9talent sur les vitres d\u00e9j\u00e0 macul\u00e9es des d\u00e9jections d\u2019insectes soulag\u00e9s. Ah ! il porte bien son nom ce scatophage stercoraire (la mouche \u00e0 merde) dont les menus gastronomiques sont sur papier hygi\u00e9nique (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLCQTmUZYH4). Quelle image du cycle de la vie puisque La larve de la mouche vit dans les mati\u00e8res organiques en putr\u00e9faction (je fais du Michel Houellebecq [http://www.lepost.fr/article/2010/09/05/2207123_houellbecq-accuse-de-plagier-wikipedia-le-buzz-minable-de-la-rentree-litteraire-sur-le-net.html]: je plagie un article sur la mouche) ! Dans la merde tu naquis, dans la merde tu tr\u00e9passes. Mais le soulagement est aussi vif que bref. Aussit\u00f4t mouches nouvelles de surgir. C\u2019est un v\u00e9ritable fl\u00e9au biblique ( http://www.ralentirtravaux.com/lettres/sequences/sixieme/sequence_5/extrait3.php ). Le dieu des H\u00e9breux avait envoy\u00e9 des mouches piqueuses et suceuses pour punir les \u00c9gyptiens ; je n\u2019ai droit qu\u2019\u00e0 la mouche \u00e0 merde. La malignit\u00e9 divine me refuse ses cr\u00e9ations les plus subtiles. Je ne d\u00e9sarme pas pour autant. Je suis devenu Sisyphe impr\u00e9cateur : \u00abVa-t\u2019en, ch\u00e9tif Insecte, excr\u00e9ment de la terre\u00bb r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e9-je \u00e0 mon tour. Mais l\u2019inanit\u00e9, la vanit\u00e9 de ma rage me fait repartir la tapette basse, je m\u2019avoue vaincu (\u00abLa puissance des mouches : elles gagnent des batailles, emp\u00eachent notre \u00e2me d'agir, mangent notre corps\u00bb \u00e9crivait Pascal) et je me souviens que la mouche est \u00e9minemment litt\u00e9raire. L\u2019on a d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9voqu\u00e9 La Fontaine ou Sartre. Il y a Rimbaud et ses \u00ab mouches \u00e9clatantes / Qui bombinent autour des puanteurs cruelles \u00bb. Il y a aussi William Golding et Sa Majest\u00e9 des Mouches r\u00e9gnant sur les enfants libres... Force est de constater que l\u2019insecte fascine, et pas seulement l\u2019entomologiste. Lucien de Samosate en fit m\u00eame l\u2019\u00e9loge ( http://remacle.org/bloodwolf/philosophes/Lucien/mouche.htm ). Il faut reconna\u00eetre que certains points sont particuli\u00e8rement convaincants : \u00ab Dans ses amours et son hymen, elle jouit de la plus enti\u00e8re libert\u00e9 : le m\u00e2le, comme le coq, ne descend pas aussit\u00f4t qu'il est mont\u00e9 ; mais il demeure longtemps \u00e0 cheval sur sa femelle qui porte son \u00e9poux sur son dos et vole avec lui, sans que rien trouble leur union a\u00e9rienne. \u00bb Salvador Dali voyait dans les mouches ce qu\u2019il appelait \u00ab les f\u00e9es de la M\u00e9diterran\u00e9e \u00bb (l\u2019insecte \u00e9voquerait m\u00eame, parait-il, la m\u00e9thode parano\u00efaque-critique). Au reste - et c\u2019est la premi\u00e8re fois, si j\u2019ose dire, que j\u2019ai commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 regarder l\u2019insecte dans les yeux - La mouche (le remake de Cronenberg http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GiIZKlQoWo4 , est aussi le titre d\u2019un film dans lequel un homme inventant une machine permettant de se t\u00e9l\u00e9porter devient un \u00eatre mi-homme mi-mouche. Enfin le dictionnaire rappelle, par sa polys\u00e9mie, la richesse du mot. La mouche n\u2019est pas qu\u2019un vil insecte. C\u2019est \u00e9galement un petit morceau de taffetas noir qui faisait ressortir la p\u00e2leur des beaut\u00e9s du grand si\u00e8cle (Verlaine en parle de cette mouche \u00ab Qui ravive l'\u00e9clat un peu niais de l'\u0153il \u00bb). C\u2019est enfin l\u2019espion (le mouchard) dont les romans de Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Parot offrent un bel exemple : Tirepot, portant deux pots et une ample robe de toile, monnaye au badaud parisien la possibilit\u00e9 de se soulager. Faisant ainsi la causette avec ses clients, il sait beaucoup de choses sur la capitale et devient la mouche du commissaire Nicolas Le Floch. Et puis le mot \u00ab mouche \u00bb abonde dans de charmantes expressions : prendre la mouche , faire mouche , faire la mouche du coche , etc. Mais quelque litt\u00e9raire que soit la mouche, aussi polys\u00e9mique soit-elle, que l\u2019on voie en elle des tr\u00e9sors d\u2019imagination, l\u2019insecte ne peut faire oublier l\u2019importunit\u00e9 de son obstin\u00e9e pr\u00e9sence. C\u2019est ce que me rappelle la radio qui diffuse Alanis Morissette ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jne9t8sHpUc&ob=av2e ) qui, voulant chanter l\u2019ironie de la vie, s\u2019\u00e9crie : \u00abIt\u2019s a black fly in your chardonnay\u00bb.

N\u2019h\u00e9site pas \u00e0 me demander les r\u00e9f\u00e9rences exactes, je te les donnerai sans m\u00eame porter l\u2019ombre d\u2019un jugement sur une demande aussi honn\u00eate. Je te conseillerai mille et une lectures, et comme le sultan, coupe-moi la t\u00eate si ces lectures ne te passionnent pas et ne reculent pas ind\u00e9finiment l\u2019heure du coucher (apr\u00e8s r\u00e9flexion, je pr\u00e9f\u00e9rerais que tu oublies cela). Un dernier mot avant de finir. Tu te demandes probablement la raison d\u2019un style aussi ampoul\u00e9 et au vocabulaire parfois abscons, et tu as raison. Je t\u2019inflige un dernier pensum : arriver jusqu\u2019au bout de ce texte, chercher les mots dans le dictionnaire. Eh ! Nombre d\u2019entre vous me liront sur leur iPod, iPad, iPhone, iMachin. Un double-clic (tap) sur les mots fera donc appara\u00eetre une d\u00e9finition du mot, et il n\u2019est alors rien de plus facile que d\u2019apprendre quelques mots. Pour les autres, il faudra vous lever et aller chercher le dictionnaire. D\u00e9sol\u00e9. J\u2019oubliais ! Je ne reverrai peut-\u00eatre jamais certains d\u2019entre vous. Certains auront un autre professeur, certains changent d\u2019\u00e9tablissement. Je vous souhaite donc de r\u00e9ussir et m\u00eame, comme dit la chanson, tout le bonheur du monde. Vous avez \u00e9t\u00e9 (tous sans exception, m\u00eame le plus casse-pieds d\u2019entre vous) des \u00e9l\u00e8ves infiniment sympathiques. Bonnes vacances, Yann Houry","title":"Bonnes vacances"},{"location":"%C3%89criture/Blog/Collaborer/","tags":["Blog"],"text":"Non publi\u00e9 sur le blog Dans \u00ab collaborer \u00bb, il y a \u00ab laborer \u00bb qui vient de \u00ab laborare \u00bb (travailler) et \u00ab co \u00bb qui veut dire \u00ab avec \u00bb. \u00ab collaborer \u00bb, c'est donc travailler avec. Mais alors toute la question est de savoir avec qui l'\u00e9l\u00e8ve travaille. Traditionnellement, il travaille le plus souvent seul. Rarement en groupe. Dans le cadre de l'EMI, cet \u00e9l\u00e8ve est souvent amen\u00e9 \u00e0 travailler en groupe. Par exemple, lorsqu'on \u00e9crit des articles Vikidia (ce Wikip\u00e9dia des 8 \u00e0 13 ans). Ce travail de groupe peut devenir un \u00ab spectacle \u00bb fascinant pour l'enseignant. L'activit\u00e9 scolaire montre combien le travail \u00e0 r\u00e9aliser est le r\u00e9v\u00e9lateur d'une n\u00e9cessaire \u00ab sociabilisation \u00bb de l'\u00e9l\u00e8ve. Certains sont compl\u00e8tement effac\u00e9s quand d'autres imposent autoritairement leur conception du travail. Tel \u00e9l\u00e8ve dit oui \u00e0 tout, tel autre s'agace qu'on refuse toutes ses propositions. R\u00e9cemment, deux \u00e9l\u00e8ves travaillaient tant bien que mal ensemble. Ils n'arr\u00eataient pas de se chamailler. Ils m'ont demand\u00e9 s'ils pouvaient travailler seuls. Je leur ai dit oui. Le cours suivant, ils se sont remis ensemble. Ils m'ont expliqu\u00e9 : \u00ab En fait, on a fait s\u00e9par\u00e9ment la m\u00eame chose \u00bb. Ils constataient qu'ils avaient perdu du temps. \u00c0 l'\u00e9cole, il faut par cons\u00e9quent que l'on passe, pour reprendre le mot de Pierre L\u00e9vy, \u00ab du cogito cart\u00e9sien au cogitamus. \u00bb Les \u00e9l\u00e8ves sont ainsi amen\u00e9s \u00e0 comprendre l'int\u00e9r\u00eat du groupe. Ils comprennent l'int\u00e9r\u00eat de la collaboration. Ils apprennent \u00e0 \u00e9couter l'autre. Par ailleurs, ce travail en groupe permet une diff\u00e9renciation. Tel groupe produit un article laborieusement, quand tel autre en fait trois. Et du fait, de cette autonomie, l'enseignant peut d\u00e9gager un peu de temps pour aider ceux qui ont besoin d'aide pendant que ceux qui n'en ont pas besoin poursuivent leur bonhomme de chemin. Les enfants travaillent donc ensemble. Une machine suffit pour un groupe de 2 ou 3 ans apr\u00e8s que les t\u00e2ches ont \u00e9t\u00e9 partag\u00e9es. Je m'imagine mes \u00e9l\u00e8ves un peu comme ces enfants auquel Sugata Mitra fournissait un ordinateur et leur confiait une t\u00e2che : apprendre \u00e0 utiliser l'ordinateur (en anglais) ou apprendre \u00e0 lire (en anglais toujours) ou encore s'initier \u00e0 la biotechnologie ! Et la m\u00e9thode de Sugata Mitra \u00e9tait la suivante : il leur laisse un ordinateur avec toutes les ressources n\u00e9cessaires et... il s'en va ! Et \u00e7a marche ! Deux mois apr\u00e8s, l'enseignant revient et demande aux enfants qui s'\u00e9taient efforc\u00e9s de comprendre quelque chose \u00e0 la biotechnologie : \u00ab Avez-vous compris quelque chose ? \u2014 Non, rien du tout. \u2014 Combien de temps vous \u00eates-vous entra\u00een\u00e9s avant de d\u00e9clarer que vous ne compreniez rien ? \u2014 On a regard\u00e9 tous les jours. \u2014 Pendant deux mois, vous avez regard\u00e9 des trucs que vous ne compreniez pas ? \u2014 Litt\u00e9ralement. \u00c0 part le fait qu\u2019une mauvaise reproduction de la mol\u00e9cule d\u2019ADN est la cause de maladies g\u00e9n\u00e9tiques, on n\u2019a rien compris d\u2019autre. \u00bb Donc les \u00e9l\u00e8ves sont capables de s'attaquer \u00e0 des projets tr\u00e8s ambitieux. Quand ils ont \u00e9crit des articles pour Vikidia , ils ont abattu un travail extr\u00eamement important (recherche de l'information, administration de la preuve, structuration du texte, correction du texte (orthographe, ponctuation et typographie), mise en forme du texte par le wikicode, publication, etc.). Et ils \u00e9taient en 6e ! Mais pour le r\u00e9aliser, ils ne sont pas seuls. Il y a \u00e9videmment la machine (qui procure des ressources nombreuses \u00e0 consulter). Il y a les autres \u00e9l\u00e8ves, il y a le professeur, mais il y aussi potentiellement et selon la nature du projet... le monde entier ! Quelques exemples. Un groupe d'\u00e9l\u00e8ves \u00e9tait sur le point de terminer son article sur Vikidia. Le texte est \u00e9crit. Il ne reste plus qu'\u00e0 le mettre en forme. \u00c7a sonne et il faut partir. Eh bien 5 minutes apr\u00e8s, un utilisateur de Vikidia avait termin\u00e9 le travail. M\u00eame chose, me racontait un ami, avec l'\u00e9laboration d'un tableau (et cela peut \u00eatre tr\u00e8s compliqu\u00e9 en wikicode). Les \u00e9l\u00e8ves ne parvenaient pas \u00e0 le construire. Un utilisateur plus chevronn\u00e9 est venu les \u00e9pauler. Ainsi, les utilisateurs de la communaut\u00e9 (Vikidia, comme Wikip\u00e9dia, font partie des communs du savoir ) sont un puissant auxiliaire de l'enseignant. En somme, on ne travaille pas seul. On n'a jamais travaill\u00e9 seul de toute fa\u00e7on. On copie, on recopie, on est aid\u00e9 par le voisin, on demande \u00e0 ses parents, etc. Et le num\u00e9rique \u00ab exponentialise \u00bb cette tendance. Deux derniers exemples. Le premier tr\u00e8s \u00e9vident : les \u00e9l\u00e8ves m'\u00e9crivent. On utilise Evernote qui devient leur cahier num\u00e9rique et il y a une fonction de tchat. On est donc parfois amen\u00e9 \u00e0 discuter un week-end ou pendant les vacances : \u00ab Monsieur, c'est bien \u00e7a qu'il fallait faire ? \u00bb me demande-t-on. L'\u00e9l\u00e8ve collabore avec l'enseignant y compris hors de la classe. Et cette collaboration pour \u00eatre men\u00e9e \u00e0 bien peut juste consister \u00e0 rassurer (ce qui est \u00e0 rapprocher d'une autre technique de Sugata Mitra : la m\u00e9thode de la grand-m\u00e8re laquelle a pour seul objectif d'inciter l'\u00e9l\u00e8ve \u00e0 poursuivre ses efforts). Dernier exemple. Nous travaillions au cours d'une lecture analytique avec Framapad , ce traitement de texte collaboratif. On partage l'URL et tout le monde se connecte pour construire l'analyse du texte. L\u00e0 aussi on peut tchatter pour sugg\u00e9rer une id\u00e9e, r\u00e9v\u00e9ler une erreur... Or, un jour, un \u00e9l\u00e8ve \u00e9tait absent. Il avait rat\u00e9 son bus (ce qu'on a su apr\u00e8s). On a donc poursuivi le travail et quelques minutes apr\u00e8s, on a pu voir l'\u00e9l\u00e8ve intervenir, demander o\u00f9 on en \u00e9tait et r\u00e9pondre. Il travaillait de chez lui via Framapad. Voil\u00e0 ce qui me fascine : cette collaboration des \u00e9l\u00e8ves entre eux, cet usage qu'ils font de la machine pour devenir plus efficace collectivement. Ce sont pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment ce qu'on a appel\u00e9 des centaures . D\u00e8s lors, on voit bien que l'\u00e9cole n'est plus un lieu clos dans laquelle l'\u00e9l\u00e8ve ferait penser \u00e0 un petit penseur de Rodin isol\u00e9. Elle est ouverte sur le monde et m\u00eame sur l'espace. Par d\u00e9finition, mon programme est changeant. Je viens de modifier un EPI croisant fran\u00e7ais, maths et physique pour permettre notre participation au concours lanc\u00e9 par Thomas Pesquet . On va tenter d'envoyer nos textes dans l'espace.","title":"Collaborer"},{"location":"%C3%89criture/Blog/Comment%20importer%20une%20vid%C3%A9o%20YouTube%2C%20DailyMotion%2C%20etc.%20dans%20iBooks%20Author/","tags":["Blog"],"text":"\ud83d\udd17 Lien En principe, lorsque vous souhaitez int\u00e9grer une vid\u00e9o dans votre site ou votre blog, vous copiez et collez une portion de code, et le tour est jou\u00e9. Ce sont quelques lignes qui ressemblent \u00e0 \u00e7a : <iframe width=\"480\" height=\"360\" src=\"[https://www.youtube.com/embed/z4CLpA3Y1Kg?rel=0](https://www.youtube.com/embed/z4CLpA3Y1Kg?rel=0)\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> ```` Il n\u2019en va pas de m\u00eame avec [iBooks Author](http://www.apple.com/fr/ibooks-author/ \"iBooks Author\"). Vous ne pouvez pas simplement copier et coller le code qui vous a \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9. Il faut r\u00e9aliser un widget. Souvenez-vous, je vous avais expliqu\u00e9 [comment importer des exercices interactifs](http://www.ralentirtravaux.com/le_blog/?p=1930 \"Comment importer des exercices interactifs ?\") que vous aviez obtenus avec un exerciseur du type HotPotatoes. La m\u00e9thode est sensiblement la m\u00eame. Vous pourrez alors int\u00e9grer dans iBooks Author n\u2019importe quelle vid\u00e9o, que celle-ci provienne de [YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/ \"YouTube\"), [DailyMotion](http://www.dailymotion.com/fr \"DailyMotion\"), [Vimeo](http://vimeo.com/ \"Vimeo\") ou l\u2019[Ina](http://www.ina.fr/ \"Ina.fr\")\u2026 \u00c9videmment, on se dira qu\u2019on aura plus vite de recourir aux services d\u2019un site comme [Bookry](http://bookry.com/author/widget/library/?from=classwidgets \"Bookry\"), mais il faut s\u2019inscrire et la cr\u00e9ation du widget qui nous int\u00e9resse ne concerne que les seuls YouTube et Vimeo. ## Pour commencer Tout d\u2019abord, cr\u00e9ez un dossier. Vous pouvez, par exemple, lui donner le nom de votre vid\u00e9o. Dans notre cas, ce sera verbe. On obtient donc un dossier intitul\u00e9 verbe. ## Cr\u00e9er un fichier HTML Dans ce dossier, placez un fichier HTML. Celui-ci doit imp\u00e9rativement s\u2019appeler Main et porter l\u2019extension .html. Votre fichier sera donc Main.html. Dans ce fichier, placez le code suivant : Entre les balises title, mettez le titre de votre vid\u00e9o. Entre les balises body, placez le code obtenu sur le site de partage de vid\u00e9o. Dans notre cas, cela donnera ceci : Le verbe ## Cr\u00e9er une image \u00c0 pr\u00e9sent, cr\u00e9ez une image de la dimension que vous voulez. Cette image va permettre d\u2019afficher votre vid\u00e9o dans votre livre fait avec iBooks Author. Ce peut \u00eatre un simple rectangle affichant le titre de votre vid\u00e9o. Vous pr\u00e9f\u00e9rerez probablement mettre une image provenant du film. Pour cela, affichez votre vid\u00e9o en plein \u00e9cran et faites une capture d\u2019\u00e9cran. Placez votre image dans le dossier verbe cr\u00e9\u00e9 au tout d\u00e9but de ce tutoriel. Attention votre image doit s\u2019appeler Default et \u00eatre au format PNG. Votre image s\u2019appellera donc Default.png. ## Cr\u00e9er un fichier PLIST Derni\u00e8re \u00e9tape avant import dans iBooks Author, cr\u00e9ez un fichier PLIST. Copiez ce code : CFBundleDevelopmentRegion French CFBundleDisplayName Le verbe CFBundleIdentifier com.widget.Untitled CFBundleName Le verbe CFBundleShortVersionString 1.0 CFBundleVersion 1.0 Height 360 MainHTML main.html Width 480 ``` Ce code doit figurer dans un fichier intitul\u00e9 Info et portant l\u2019extension PLIST. Votre fichier sera donc Info.plist. L\u2019essentiel \u00e0 retenir de ce fichier XML est qu\u2019il d\u00e9livre un certain nombre d\u2019informations \u00e0 propos de votre vid\u00e9o. Les plus importantes \u00e9tant les dimensions de cette vid\u00e9o. Soyez s\u00fbr que ces dimensions correspondent \u00e0 celles qui se trouvent dans votre fichier PLIST. Ma vid\u00e9o est de 480 par 360. Ce sont des dimensions qui m\u2019ont \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9es par YouTube (naturellement, j\u2019aurais pu en obtenir d\u2019autres). Elles doivent donc figurer dans le fichier PLIST. Pour finir \u29eb Maintenant que vous avez les 3 fichiers Main.html, Default.png et Info.plist dans votre dossier verbe, il vous reste une chose \u00e0 faire. Il faut ajouter l\u2019extension WDGT \u00e0 votre dossier qui sera d\u00e9sormais un widget intitul\u00e9 verbe.wdgt. Il n\u2019y a plus rien \u00e0 faire si ce n\u2019est glisser et d\u00e9poser le widget dans iBooks Author. Branchez votre iPad. Cliquez sur Aper\u00e7u et v\u00e9rifiez que votre vid\u00e9o fonctionne. Si quelque chose ne fonctionne pas, si vous d\u00e9sirez modifier votre widget, il faudra faire un clic droit et choisir Afficher le contenu du paquet.","title":"Comment importer une vid\u00e9o YouTube, DailyMotion, etc. dans iBooks Author"},{"location":"%C3%89criture/Blog/Comment%20importer%20une%20vid%C3%A9o%20YouTube%2C%20DailyMotion%2C%20etc.%20dans%20iBooks%20Author/#pour-finir","text":"Maintenant que vous avez les 3 fichiers Main.html, Default.png et Info.plist dans votre dossier verbe, il vous reste une chose \u00e0 faire.

Il y a un d\u00e9but \u00e0 tout. En fait, comme j\u2019ai re\u00e7u plusieurs messages me demandant comment j\u2019avais r\u00e9alis\u00e9 tel ou tel exercice pour mon manuel, je me suis dit que j\u2019allais expliquer les choses une bonne fois pour toutes. Et je n\u2019aurai, ensuite, plus qu\u2019\u00e0 indiquer le lien \u00e0 chaque fois qu\u2019on me posera la question. Le droit \u00e0 la fain\u00e9antise m\u00e9rite bien quelques efforts. Avant de vous expliquer comment je m\u2019y suis pris pour int\u00e9grer certains exercices r\u00e9alis\u00e9s avec HotPotatoes dans iBooks Author, je tiens \u00e0 prendre quelques pr\u00e9cautions d\u2019usage. Je n\u2019ai rien d\u2019un sp\u00e9cialiste. Je bidouille, et, \u00e0 force, le HTML ou le CSS me deviennent plus ou moins familiers. Quant au JavaScript, je suis une v\u00e9ritable quiche dont la nullit\u00e9 crasse ne peut qu\u2019inviter \u00e0 l\u2019humilit\u00e9. Bref, si je dis une b\u00eatise, je vous prierai de ne pas m\u2019en vouloir. Les intentions sont nobles, l\u2019exactitude des renseignements subs\u00e9quents non garantie. Commen\u00e7ons. ![[Tutot1.mov]] Si vous n\u2019aimez pas les vid\u00e9os, lisez la suite. De toute fa\u00e7on, c\u2019est compl\u00e9mentaire. I - Utiliser le widget HTML \u29eb ![[Widget HTML.png]] Si, dans un \u00e9lan d\u2019enthousiasme na\u00eff, vous choisissez de cr\u00e9er un widget HTML, et que vous cherchez \u00e0 y entrer beno\u00eetement un peu de HTML, vous constaterez que rien ne se passe. Vous ne pouvez rien faire. Vous aurez beau cliquer sur le rectangle indiquant HTML, ce sera en vain. Stup\u00e9fait, vous d\u00e9couvrez ensuite que l\u2019inspecteur vous propose de choisir un widget HTML 5. Et, en effet, vous avez la possibilit\u00e9 d\u2019importer quelque chose portant l\u2019extension .wdgt. J\u2019abandonne dor\u00e9navant le ton un tantinet verbeux que j\u2019ai employ\u00e9 jusqu\u2019\u00e0 pr\u00e9sent, je vous \u00e9pargne la description de l\u2019\u00e9tonnement, l\u2019agacement et le d\u00e9pit que j\u2019ai \u00e9prouv\u00e9s. Je vous passe les phases d\u2019\u00e9nervement et d\u2019abandon, et j\u2019en viens aux r\u00e9sultats auxquels je suis parvenu. II - Cr\u00e9er un widget \u29eb Vous l\u2019aurez compris. Il s\u2019agit de cr\u00e9er un widget, par vous-m\u00eame. Ne croyez pas ceux qui vous disent qu\u2019il faut t\u00e9l\u00e9charger xCode et tout le tintouin. C\u2019est peut-\u00eatre gratuit, mais c\u2019est tr\u00e8s lourd et parfaitement inutile pour ce que nous allons faire. En fait, tout ce que vous devez faire consiste \u00e0 cr\u00e9er un dossier le plus simplement du monde. Vous cr\u00e9ez votre dossier, vous lui donnez l\u2019extension .wdgt, et votre dossier change d\u2019apparence. Il devient un widget ! Un widget parfaitement vide, mais un widget. ![[wdgt.png]] Vous faites alors un clic droit sur ledit widget et vous choisissez Afficher le contenu du paquet. \u00c9videmment, il n\u2019y a rien dedans. Vous allez devoir le \u00ab remplir \u00bb. ![[afficher.png]] III - Remplir votre widget \u29eb Que mettre dedans ? Eh bien l\u2019exercice que vous avez r\u00e9alis\u00e9 avec HotPotatoes (pour \u00e7a, je ne vous explique pas comment faire ; il y a d\u2019ailleurs une kyrielle de tutoriels sur le sujet). Vous allez donc mettre dans votre widget, le fichier que vous avez cr\u00e9\u00e9 avec HotPotatoes. Quel que soit le nom que vous lui avez donn\u00e9 au moment de sa cr\u00e9ation, vous allez devoir le renommer. Il doit imp\u00e9rativement porter le nom suivant : index.html. Attention, HotPotatoes cr\u00e9e des fichiers portant l\u2019extension .htm, vous devrez la changer pour .html. Ensuite, vous devez cr\u00e9er un fichier .plist r\u00e9pondant au doux nom de Info.plist dans lequel vous devez \u00e9crire les lignes ci-dessous : <plist version=\"1.0\"> <dict> <key>CFBundleDevelopmentRegion</key> <string>French</string> <key>CFBundleDisplayName</key> <string>Exercice</string> <key>CFBundleIdentifier</key> <string>com.exercice</string> <key>CFBundleName</key> <string>Exercice</string> <key>CFBundleShortVersionString</key> <string>1.0</string> <key>CFBundleVersion</key> <string>1.0</string> <key>Height</key> <integer>768</integer> <key>MainHTML</key> <string>index.html</string> <key>Width</key> <integer>1024</integer> </dict> </plist> \u00c9videmment, vous voudrez peut-\u00eatre modifier certaines informations, non pas ce qui est compris entre et , mais ce qui est entre et ou et . Mais, quels que soient les choix que vous ferez, il n\u2019y a pas l\u00e0 de grandes difficult\u00e9s. Vous devez enfin cr\u00e9er une image devant \u00eatre intitul\u00e9 Default. Elle aura l\u2019extension .png. Cette image est celle qui servira \u00e0 iBooks Author pour afficher votre exercice. Pour ma part, j\u2019ai c\u00e9d\u00e9 \u00e0 la facilit\u00e9 et j\u2019ai cr\u00e9\u00e9 une image avec Pixelmator sur laquelle j\u2019ai \u00e9crit... Exercice (ce n\u2019est pas tr\u00e8s original, je sais). ![[Exercice.png]] Est-ce tout ? Bah ! non. IV - Modifier le code de index.html \u29eb Une des caract\u00e9ristiques de HotPotatoes est de produire des choses assez moches. Quand je r\u00e9alise un exercice avec ce logiciel, je change une partie du CSS afin que ce soit le plus neutre possible. N\u2019\u00e9tant pas un ma\u00eetre de la feuille de style, j\u2019essaie au moins d\u2019aspirer \u00e0 la sobri\u00e9t\u00e9. Je me dis que \u00e7a passera mieux. Que faut-il faire ? Pas grand-chose. Il faut ouvrir votre fichier index.html dans un \u00e9diteur de code. J\u2019utilise Coda, mais il en existe de nombreux notamment TextWrangler qui est gratuit.

Ce sont mes r\u00e9acs pr\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9s, mais je sais \u00e0 quoi m\u2019en tenir. Je suis donc en pr\u00e9sence d\u2019un article pour lequel l\u2019auteur va consacrer toute son intelligence \u00e0 vouloir d\u00e9montrer une chose : l\u2019\u00e9cole meurt, et le num\u00e9rique est son virus. Je me garderai bien de r\u00e9colter un point Godwin si t\u00f4t, mais enfin le parall\u00e8le avec la d\u00e9cadence (le corps qui d\u00e9p\u00e9rit), le mal localis\u00e9, incarn\u00e9... On a l\u00e0 tous les poncifs de la pens\u00e9e r\u00e9actionnaire. Il ne manque plus que le nivellement par le bas, le bon sens, et on y est. \u00c9videmment, je ne vais pas entamer un paragraphe pour expliquer l\u2019innocuit\u00e9 du num\u00e9rique \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9cole. Dans la majorit\u00e9 des \u00e9coles, coll\u00e8ges et lyc\u00e9es de France et de Navarre, le num\u00e9rique se r\u00e9duit \u00e0 une mis\u00e9rable salle informatique pour des centaines d\u2019\u00e9l\u00e8ves. Ce n\u2019est pas \u00e7a qui est mortif\u00e8re. \u00c0 lire le contempteur des usages informatiques, les \u00e9l\u00e8ves paresseux et pas tr\u00e8s fut\u00e9s seraient les fautifs. Mais il faut dire que ces pauvres enfants, \u00e0 qui l\u2019on confie des bijoux technologiques d\u00e8s leur plus tendre \u00e2ge, ont des enseignants qui pr\u00e9f\u00e8rent se gausser de leur nullit\u00e9 plut\u00f4t que leur apprendre \u00e0 s\u2019en servir. Et que dire ce pr\u00e9tendu paradoxe dont la formulation ne se pare des plumes de la rh\u00e9torique que pour masquer son indigence ? Des phrases comme celle-l\u00e0, je vous en ponds \u00e0 la dizaine : \u00abOn ne profite du sport que quand on a form\u00e9 son corps sans lui\u00bb ou encore \u00abOn ne profite de l\u2019informatique que quand on n\u2019a jamais utilis\u00e9 un ordinateur \u00bb. Ah ! mince ! Celle-l\u00e0 a d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 faite... Une manipulation un rien perverse \u29eb Et puis, tout de m\u00eame, quelque talentueuse que soit la d\u00e9monstration, elle n\u2019est pas d\u00e9pourvue d\u2019une certaine perversit\u00e9. Semer des erreurs sur un texte et un auteur dont les \u00e9l\u00e8ves ignorent tout ; attendre d\u2019eux, d\u00e9nu\u00e9s qu\u2019ils sont, qu\u2019ils se fourvoient dans le pi\u00e8ge tendu pour ensuite jeter le bl\u00e2me sur des proc\u00e9d\u00e9s auxquels on s\u2019attendait qu\u2019ils s\u2019adonnent et qu\u2019on a m\u00eame favoris\u00e9s, si cela n\u2019est pas de la manipulation, de la perversit\u00e9... Les voix de la p\u00e9dagogie \u00e9tant inextricables, la chose \u00e9tait concevable si elle amenait \u00e0 prendre en compte l\u2019usage des sources sur internet, \u00e0 poursuivre la d\u00e9monstration par un travail sur le bon usage des sources sur internet ou ailleurs. Parce qu\u2019il n\u2019y a qu\u2019un na\u00eff pour pr\u00e9tendre que le plagiat \u00e9hont\u00e9 est l\u2019apanage de notre \u00e9poque. Pour autant que je sache, les \u00e9l\u00e8ves ont toujours puis\u00e9 o\u00f9 ils le pouvaient des r\u00e9flexions toutes pr\u00eates, leur \u00e9pargnant ainsi le moindre effort de pens\u00e9e. Ce n\u2019est franchement pas une nouveaut\u00e9. Je ne d\u00e9veloppe pas ce point ; on ne va pas ergoter pour savoir si aujourd\u2019hui c\u2019est plus facile ou si, avant, prendre le stylo pour recopier \u00e9tait d\u2019un quelconque profit. Tout au plus fera-t-on remarquer que si l\u2019on ne veut pas, lors d\u2019un devoir, qu\u2019un \u00e9l\u00e8ve en classe prenne son iPhone pour butiner des r\u00e9ponses toutes faites, on peut aussi se donner la peine de le surveiller. Pour conclure \u29eb Achevons. L\u2019id\u00e9e est de battre en br\u00e8che l\u2019usage d\u2019internet, de le pourrir annonce le titre. La conclusion est \u00e9videmment sans appel : \u00ab Leur servitude [celle des \u00e9l\u00e8ves] \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard d'internet va m\u00eame \u00e0 l'encontre de l'autonomie de pens\u00e9e et de la culture personnelle que l'\u00e9cole est suppos\u00e9e leur donner. \u00bb Ainsi l\u2019\u00e9cole serait l\u2019oppos\u00e9e d\u2019internet, l\u2019\u00e9cole \u00e9mancipe tandis qu\u2019internet asservi. Je n\u2019ai vu aucune d\u00e9monstration permettant d\u2019aboutir \u00e0 ce constat. J\u2019ai vu en revanche des lyc\u00e9ens paresseux, mais est-ce que cette paresse s\u2019origine dans l\u2019usage d\u2019internet ? Tr\u00e8s sinc\u00e8rement ?

D\u2019ailleurs, en parcourant la liste de liens en regard de ce texte, je ne m\u2019y trompe plus, je suis bien en pr\u00e9sence d\u2019un lecteur de N\u00e9oprofs, de Bonnet d\u2019\u00e2ne, probablement membre de Sauver les lettres, etc. Ce n\u2019est pas bien grave. Ce sont mes r\u00e9acs pr\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9s, mais je sais \u00e0 quoi m\u2019en tenir. Je suis donc en pr\u00e9sence d\u2019un article pour lequel l\u2019auteur va consacrer toute son intelligence \u00e0 vouloir d\u00e9montrer une chose : l\u2019\u00e9cole meurt, et le num\u00e9rique est son virus. Je me garderai bien de r\u00e9colter un point Godwin si t\u00f4t, mais enfin le parall\u00e8le avec la d\u00e9cadence (le corps qui d\u00e9p\u00e9rit), le mal localis\u00e9, incarn\u00e9...

Il ne manque plus que le nivellement par le bas, le bon sens, et on y est. \u00c9videmment, je ne vais pas entamer un paragraphe pour expliquer l\u2019innocuit\u00e9 du num\u00e9rique \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9cole. Dans la majorit\u00e9 des \u00e9coles, coll\u00e8ges et lyc\u00e9es de France et de Navarre, le num\u00e9rique se r\u00e9duit \u00e0 une mis\u00e9rable salle informatique pour des centaines d\u2019\u00e9l\u00e8ves. Ce n\u2019est pas \u00e7a qui est mortif\u00e8re. \u00c0 lire le contempteur des usages informatiques, les \u00e9l\u00e8ves paresseux et pas tr\u00e8s fut\u00e9s seraient les fautifs. Mais il faut dire que ces pauvres enfants, \u00e0 qui l\u2019on confie des bijoux technologiques d\u00e8s leur plus tendre \u00e2ge, ont des enseignants qui pr\u00e9f\u00e8rent se gausser de leur nullit\u00e9 plut\u00f4t que leur apprendre \u00e0 s\u2019en servir. Et que dire ce pr\u00e9tendu paradoxe dont la formulation ne se pare des plumes de la rh\u00e9torique que pour masquer son indigence ? Des phrases comme celle-l\u00e0, je vous en ponds \u00e0 la dizaine : \u00abOn ne profite du sport que quand on a form\u00e9 son corps sans lui\u00bb ou encore \u00abOn ne profite de l\u2019informatique que quand on n\u2019a jamais utilis\u00e9 un ordinateur \u00bb.

Souvenez-vous que sous iOS, dans sa premi\u00e8re version, en \u00e9tait d\u00e9pourvu. Et \u00e7a manquait terriblement ! Heureusement, les choses se sont rapidement arrang\u00e9es (c'\u00e9tait sous iOS 3) mais le presse-papier est rest\u00e9... le presse-papier. En effet, peut-\u00eatre avez-vous d\u00e9j\u00e0 trouv\u00e9 que le presse-papier \u00e9tait une fonction g\u00e9niale mais qu'elle manquait de subtilit\u00e9. On copie, on colle et si on recopie, on perd ce qui avait pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment \u00e9t\u00e9 sauvegard\u00e9 dans notre presse-papier. Bien s\u00fbr, sur Mac ou PC, on a des presse-papier multiples que l'on peut convoquer d'un raccourci clavier et qui permettent de retrouver en 1 clic ce qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 copi\u00e9-coll\u00e9 deux heures auparavant. Sur iPad, rien de tel. Et ce pour des raisons assez \u00e9videntes : pas de raccourcis clavier et encore moins de possibilit\u00e9 pour une app de tourner en t\u00e2che de fond et ainsi enregistrer tout ce qui se passe. Pourtant, il existe sur iOS des solutions et Copied et l'une de celles-ci. Il y en a plein d'autres, comme Clips, mais Copied est vraiment une solution \u00e0 part, tant l'app est riche de possibilit\u00e9s. Voyons quelques exemples de ce qu'il est possible de faire. Tout copier \u29eb Avec Copied, vous allez pouvoir conserver un certain nombre de choses que vous avez copi\u00e9 puis que vous voudrez coller ult\u00e9rieurement, ce qui peut \u00eatre n'importe quoi : du texte, un lien, une image\u2026 L'application appelle \u00e7a non pas des clips mais des clippings. Dans les r\u00e9glages, j'ai choisi d'en conserver jusqu'\u00e0 500 mais on pourrait aller jusqu'\u00e0 1000 ! Pour cela, il existe de tr\u00e8s nombreuses fa\u00e7ons de faire. En voici quelques-unes. Enregistrer du texte \u29eb Pour enregistrer du texte, je proc\u00e8de en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de fa\u00e7on assez traditionnelle, en faisant appara\u00eetre par un appui prolong\u00e9 ce menu. Ce qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 copi\u00e9 est alors stock\u00e9 dans Copied. Un petit triangle vert dans le coin sup\u00e9rieur droit m'indique qu'un nouvel \u00e9l\u00e9ment a \u00e9t\u00e9 copi\u00e9. Si je veux que l'app conserve ce texte, alors par un glissement de l'index vers la gauche, je fais appara\u00eetre un menu qui me propose d'archiver tout ce qu'il me plaira de conserver et je tapote sur cette ic\u00f4ne. Enregistrer une URL \u29eb Mais si je veux copier une URL, j'aurai plut\u00f4t recours au menu de partage. Par ce moyen, on peut choisir soit Copier tr\u00e8s simplement, soit utiliser l'extension Save to Copied, ce qui aura pour effet non seulement d\u2019enregistrer le lien dans le presse-papier mais aussi d\u2019archiver ce lien dans l\u2019application Copied sans avoir \u00e0 se rendre dans l'app. De plus, le titre de la page aura \u00e9t\u00e9 enregistr\u00e9 ! Enregistrer une image \u29eb De la m\u00eame fa\u00e7on, Copied peut garder en m\u00e9moire des images. Un appui prolong\u00e9 sur une image vous permet de la copier. Copied l'enregistre et on remarque qu'on a en plus quelques informations utiles : le format de l'image, la taille ou encore l'URL de la page sur laquelle on l'a trouv\u00e9e ! R\u00e9utiliser ce qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 copi\u00e9 \u29eb Si vous voulez r\u00e9utiliser ce que vous avez conserv\u00e9 dans Copied, c\u2019est on ne peut plus simple, rapide et \u00e9l\u00e9gant. Vous voyez cette colonne de gauche ? C'est l\u00e0 o\u00f9 se trouvent tout ce que vous avez copi\u00e9. Le texte, les liens en bleu, les images... Si vous voulez r\u00e9utiliser l'un ou l'autre, il suffit de glisser l\u2019index vers la droite et le texte, l\u2019image ou le lien appara\u00eet automatiquement dans le presse-papier. C'est une fonction que j'utilise \u00e9norm\u00e9ment tant elle augmente votre productivit\u00e9. C'est encore plus rapide qu'un raccourci clavier. De ce point de vue, je trouve que l'interface tactile a vraiment ici un avantage \u00e0 faire valoir en terme d'efficacit\u00e9 dans le travail. Des listes \u29eb Mais ce qui m'a vraiment s\u00e9duit dans Copied, \u00e7a a \u00e9t\u00e9 la possibilit\u00e9 de faire des listes, ce qu\u2019il est possible de faire ainsi : vous glissez l\u2019index vers la gauche et choisissez cette ic\u00f4ne, et soit vous ajoutez votre texte \u00e0 une liste d\u00e9j\u00e0 cr\u00e9\u00e9e, soit vous cr\u00e9ez une liste puis ajoutez votre texte. De cette mani\u00e8re, j'enregistre des bouts de textes, des bouts de code, des liens que j'utilise souvent, des adresses mail que je n'ai pas envie d'\u00e9crire \u00e0 la main ou encore des appr\u00e9ciations que je place sur les copies de mes \u00e9l\u00e8ves. Ainsi, j'ai une banque d'observations qui sont la plupart du temps toujours les m\u00eames, que je n'ai pas envie de r\u00e9\u00e9crire inlassablement et que je colle dans la marge d'une copie dans une petite note cliquable o\u00f9 je peux m'exprimer pleinement sans avoir \u00e0 subir les limites de place que l'on trouve habituellement sur une copie papier. Pour agr\u00e9menter mes copies num\u00e9riques d'un peu de couleur, j'ai \u00e9galement fait une liste de Bitmojis qui permettent de donner une petite id\u00e9e de ce que va contenir le commentaire audio sur la copie. Mais ce qui est vraiment g\u00e9nial, c'est la fa\u00e7on dont je vais convoquer ces petits bouts de texte ou ces images. Il y a pour cela plusieurs fa\u00e7ons : je peux lancer l'app, bien s\u00fbr et jongler d\u2019une app \u00e0 l\u2019autre pour copier puis coller le texte. Je peux aussi recourir \u00e0 Split View qui permet d\u2019afficher deux apps c\u00f4te \u00e0 c\u00f4te sur l\u2019iPad. Un simple glissement me permet de placer dans le presse-papier le texte que je d\u00e9sire copier. Mais il y a, de mon point de vue, encore mieux. J'utilise le clavier et mes portions de textes me tombent directement sous la main. En effet, l\u2019app inclut un clavier constitu\u00e9 de blocs qui sont autant de portions de textes que j\u2019ai archiv\u00e9s puis class\u00e9s dans une liste. Pour que ce clavier soit utilisable, il faut auparavant \u00eatre all\u00e9 dans les R\u00e9glages puis dans G\u00e9n\u00e9ral puis dans Clavier et encore Claviers puis Ajouter un clavier et choisir Copied. Formater \u29eb Les merveilles de Copied ne s\u2019arr\u00eatent pas l\u00e0 ! Prenons, par exemple, une URL comme celle-ci que vous avez enregistr\u00e9e dans l'app. Si vous tapotez sur les trois petits points en haut, vous obtiendrez la possibilit\u00e9 de formater l\u2019URL. Ainsi, si vous choisissez la premi\u00e8re option (Format & Copy), on peut obtenir un lien et le titre de la page directement au format HTML ou Markdown. C\u2019est extr\u00eamement pratique quand vous \u00e9crivez un article dans lequel vous ins\u00e9rez des liens, beaucoup de liens. Cela vous \u00e9vite de taper le titre puis l\u2019adresse, etc. Il y a encore de nombreuses options de formatages, d'options tout court d'ailleurs. Ainsi, si vous choisissez cette portion de texte et que vous tapez sur ces trois points, vous avez, entre autres, la possibilit\u00e9 de retrouver la page d'o\u00f9 provient ledit texte. Remarquez que Copied int\u00e8gre un navigateur int\u00e9gr\u00e9. Il y a aussi la fonction Find & Replace qui peut \u00eatre utilis\u00e9e de diff\u00e9rentes mani\u00e8res. Si vous \u00eates d\u00e9veloppeur par exemple et que vous voulez remplacer des caract\u00e8res accentu\u00e9s par le code au format HTML ou encore si vous avez un texte que vous avez scann\u00e9 avec un OCR et que vous souhaitez faire des modifications par lot. Autre exemple : on peut, dans Text Formatter, s\u00e9lectionner Quote et ainsi transformer ce texte en une citation avec les guillemets, le titre de la page et l'adresse ! Comme \u00e7a ! En un seul geste ! Derni\u00e8re chose. On a la possibilit\u00e9 de s\u00e9lectionner plusieurs \u00e9l\u00e9ments, des liens par exemple pour les rassembler en un clip unique. Tapotez sur les trois petits points puis choisissez Select Clippings. Vous proc\u00e9dez ainsi\u2026 puis tapotez sur cette dr\u00f4le d\u2019ic\u00f4ne, choisissez Apply Template puis Merge. Tous vos liens auront \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9unis en un seul clip que vous n\u2019aurez plus qu\u2019\u00e0 s\u00e9lectionner pour tout copier \u00e0 la fois. Il y a m\u00eame mieux. On peut cr\u00e9er ses propres scripts pour appliquer des modifications par lot ou effectuer divers formatages. Si vous vouez voir ce que \u00e7a peut donner, vous pouvez t\u00e9l\u00e9charger ce script sur MacStories qui vous permettra de fusionner vos liens et de les formater (ici en Markdown). Tous les liens sont alors rassembl\u00e9s, format\u00e9s, pr\u00eats \u00e0 figurer dans une liste, une sitographie par exemple dans laquelle titre et liens des pages ont \u00e9t\u00e9 automatiquement g\u00e9n\u00e9r\u00e9s. Je ne sais pas ce que vous en pensez, mais en ce qui me concerne Copied est une app indispensable qui tire parti avantageusement des contraintes d'iOS, qui me permet de travailler plus rapidement et plus efficacement. Et c'est ce genre d'app qui m'\u00e9loigne de plus en plus des machines de bureau ! \u00c0 ce propos, j'oubliais compl\u00e8tement de mentionner que l'app permet, via iCloud, de synchroniser ses clips entre diff\u00e9rents appareils !

Pour que ce clavier soit utilisable, il faut auparavant \u00eatre all\u00e9 dans les R\u00e9glages puis dans G\u00e9n\u00e9ral puis dans Clavier et encore Claviers puis Ajouter un clavier et choisir Copied.","title":"Des listes"},{"location":"%C3%89criture/Blog/Copied/#formater","text":"Les merveilles de Copied ne s\u2019arr\u00eatent pas l\u00e0 ! Prenons, par exemple, une URL comme celle-ci que vous avez enregistr\u00e9e dans l'app. Si vous tapotez sur les trois petits points en haut, vous obtiendrez la possibilit\u00e9 de formater l\u2019URL. Ainsi, si vous choisissez la premi\u00e8re option (Format & Copy), on peut obtenir un lien et le titre de la page directement au format HTML ou Markdown. C\u2019est extr\u00eamement pratique quand vous \u00e9crivez un article dans lequel vous ins\u00e9rez des liens, beaucoup de liens. Cela vous \u00e9vite de taper le titre puis l\u2019adresse, etc. Il y a encore de nombreuses options de formatages, d'options tout court d'ailleurs. Ainsi, si vous choisissez cette portion de texte et que vous tapez sur ces trois points, vous avez, entre autres, la possibilit\u00e9 de retrouver la page d'o\u00f9 provient ledit texte. Remarquez que Copied int\u00e8gre un navigateur int\u00e9gr\u00e9. Il y a aussi la fonction Find & Replace qui peut \u00eatre utilis\u00e9e de diff\u00e9rentes mani\u00e8res. Si vous \u00eates d\u00e9veloppeur par exemple et que vous voulez remplacer des caract\u00e8res accentu\u00e9s par le code au format HTML ou encore si vous avez un texte que vous avez scann\u00e9 avec un OCR et que vous souhaitez faire des modifications par lot. Autre exemple : on peut, dans Text Formatter, s\u00e9lectionner Quote et ainsi transformer ce texte en une citation avec les guillemets, le titre de la page et l'adresse ! Comme \u00e7a ! En un seul geste ! Derni\u00e8re chose. On a la possibilit\u00e9 de s\u00e9lectionner plusieurs \u00e9l\u00e9ments, des liens par exemple pour les rassembler en un clip unique. Tapotez sur les trois petits points puis choisissez Select Clippings. Vous proc\u00e9dez ainsi\u2026 puis tapotez sur cette dr\u00f4le d\u2019ic\u00f4ne, choisissez Apply Template puis Merge.

On peut cr\u00e9er ses propres scripts pour appliquer des modifications par lot ou effectuer divers formatages. Si vous vouez voir ce que \u00e7a peut donner, vous pouvez t\u00e9l\u00e9charger ce script sur MacStories qui vous permettra de fusionner vos liens et de les formater (ici en Markdown).

Sans aller jusqu\u2019\u00e0 hurler avec les loups de Sauver les lettres, on peut s\u2019\u00e9tonner qu\u2019un questionnaire portant sur un conte ne contienne quasiment aucune question de grammaire. \u00c0 lire le sujet de l\u2019\u00e9preuve, on en vient m\u00eame \u00e0 se dire que ce sujet pourrait \u00eatre donn\u00e9 \u00e0 des \u00e9l\u00e8ves de sixi\u00e8me. En effet, il pourrait - exception faite de la question portant sur l\u2019indirect libre - \u00eatre trait\u00e9 sans r\u00e9elle difficult\u00e9 par les plus jeunes coll\u00e9giens. Est-ce \u00e0 dire que le sujet de troisi\u00e8me n\u2019\u00e9tait qu\u2019un sujet de sixi\u00e8me ? Que le niveau du brevet - qui est celui du coll\u00e8ge, non celui de troisi\u00e8me - est celui du plus petit niveau ? Que le niveau est de plus en plus bas ? Que c\u2019est la faute du socle ? Et je ne sais quoi d\u2019autre ? Pour r\u00e9pondre, ou plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment, pour tenter d\u2019apporter sinon un d\u00e9but de r\u00e9ponse du moins un embryon de r\u00e9flexion, j\u2019ai d\u00fb faire un peu d\u2019arch\u00e9ologie scolaire. Sans remonter jusqu\u2019\u00e0 la protohistoire du brevet (https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dipl%C3%B4me_national_du_brevet), rappelons que, de 1978 \u00e0 1985, ce dipl\u00f4me s\u2019obtient par le contr\u00f4le continu. Ce n\u2019est qu\u2019en 1986 que les coll\u00e9giens - dont je fus - pass\u00e8rent \u00e0 nouveau cette \u00e9preuve. \u00c0 quoi pouvait bien alors ressembler cette \u00e9preuve ? \u00c9tait-elle plus difficile que celle \u00e0 laquelle nos coll\u00e9giens ont droit aujourd\u2019hui ? Pour y r\u00e9pondre, pas la peine de chercher sur le web, on ne trouve pas grand-chose. J\u2019ai cherch\u00e9, mais vainement. Peut-\u00eatre qu\u2019un autre que moi saura mieux s\u2019y prendre, mais je n\u2019ai pas trouv\u00e9. Je me suis alors souvenu que mon p\u00e8re qui \u00e9tait chef d\u2019\u00e9tablissement dans le coll\u00e8ge o\u00f9 j\u2019ai pass\u00e9 le brevet avait gard\u00e9 les sujets de fran\u00e7ais (et aussi d\u2019histoire et de maths pour ceux que cela int\u00e9resse). Par chance, j\u2019avais gard\u00e9 le sujet, que je vous laisse d\u00e9couvrir. La diff\u00e9rence saute aux yeux. C\u2019est bien simple, le sujet de l\u2019ann\u00e9e 2012 est l\u2019exact contraire du sujet de 1986. Autant le premier \u00e9vacue la grammaire, autant le second lui accord une place sym\u00e9triquement proportionnelle au nombre de questions de compr\u00e9hension. L\u2019important n\u2019est alors pas tant de montrer sa compr\u00e9hension du texte que de faire la preuve de ses capacit\u00e9s grammaticales. Les exigences sont nombreuses : conjugaison du futur, du pass\u00e9 simple (avec un trait d\u2019union !), du pass\u00e9 compos\u00e9, du conditionnel pr\u00e9sent. Le bin\u00f4me nature et fonction est \u00e9videmment de la partie . Et, enfin, des questions sur les propositions subordonn\u00e9es que je n\u2019oserais pas donner au meilleur de mes \u00e9l\u00e8ves. Que faut-il conclure ? Que le niveau d\u2019exigence a baiss\u00e9 ? Que le niveau des \u00e9l\u00e8ves a cons\u00e9quemment baiss\u00e9 ? La r\u00e9ponse pourrait para\u00eetre \u00e9vidente au professeur de fran\u00e7ais que je suis. Il n\u2019est que de voir ce qu\u2019on demandait aux \u00e9l\u00e8ves et ce qu\u2019on leur demande aujourd\u2019hui. La diff\u00e9rence est telle qu\u2019il n\u2019y a pas l\u2019ombre d\u2019une h\u00e9sitation. Vraiment ? Ce serait faire peu de cas d\u2019un d\u00e9tail. Mon p\u00e8re avait gard\u00e9 les sujets. Il avait aussi gard\u00e9 une photocopie de ma copie. R\u00e9trospectivement, cela fait un peu mal. Ce n\u2019est pas mauvais, ce n\u2019est pas bon. Si je m\u2019en sors relativement honorablement en dict\u00e9e, je d\u00e9couvre (ou red\u00e9couvre, on oublie ce genre de choses) que je n\u2019\u00e9tais pas une fl\u00e8che en grammaire. Je ne vous montrerai pas les horreurs que j\u2019ai pondues sur les propositions subordonn\u00e9es, mais voici un exemple de mes capacit\u00e9s en conjugaison ou \u00e0 r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 des questions englobant nature et fonction. Voudrait-on remettre un tel sujet au go\u00fbt du jour ? Alors il faudrait rappeler que seulement 50 % des \u00e9l\u00e8ves ont obtenu leur brevet cette ann\u00e9e-l\u00e0 . Probablement, la notation n\u2019\u00e9tait pas la m\u00eame. En lisant le bar\u00e8me, je prends conscience que la dict\u00e9e en 1986 comptait pour 15 points. Aujourd\u2019hui, c\u2019est 6 points, auxquels il faut certes ajouter les 4 points de l\u2019exercice de r\u00e9\u00e9criture. Mais ce sont 15 points sur 80, alors que l\u2019\u00e9preuve de fran\u00e7ais actuelle ( voir le sujet de l\u2019ann\u00e9e 2016 ) compte pour 40 points\u2026 Je vous laisse conclure. Le sujet de l\u2019ann\u00e9e 2012 \u00e9tait, en effet, tr\u00e8s facile (et certaines questions pos\u00e9es en 2014 et en 2015 \u00e9taient ridiculement faciles). Pour autant, nombre d\u2019\u00e9l\u00e8ves auront achopp\u00e9 sur tel ou tel point. Finalement, si l\u2019on consid\u00e8re le sujet de 2012 , un texte de Michel Tournier, c\u2019est encore un peu \u00e9litiste pour beaucoup d\u2019\u00e9l\u00e8ves (qu\u2019est-ce qu\u2019un calife ? C\u2019est vraiment un conte ? Quelle est cette histoire de cuisinier et de comm\u00e9moration ?). La question n\u2019est-elle pas de savoir ce que l\u2019on veut \u00ab retirer \u00bb de ce coll\u00e8ge. D\u00e9sire-t-on qu\u2019un \u00e9l\u00e8ve sache manier les propositions subordonn\u00e9es cons\u00e9cutives ou sache \u00e9crire correctement et comprendre ce qu\u2019il lit ? Malgr\u00e9 tout mon amour de la litt\u00e9rature, tout mon int\u00e9r\u00eat pour la grammaire, toute l\u2019exigence dont je peux faire preuve \u00e0 longueur de temps, je ne peux que pencher pour la deuxi\u00e8me solution. Et le sujet de 2014 (et dont j\u2019avais propos\u00e9 une correction ), qui invitait les candidats \u00e0 r\u00e9fl\u00e9chir sur la prose po\u00e9tique de Saint-Exup\u00e9ry, a montr\u00e9 que des comp\u00e9tences importantes de lecteur \u00e9taient requises. Reste que bien souvent les consignes de correction nous invitent \u00e0 la cl\u00e9mence, ce qui se con\u00e7oit, mais une cl\u00e9mence qui a clairement pour objectif de distribuer des points all\u00e8grement : \u00ab l\u2019\u00e9l\u00e8ve a le droit de dire qu\u2019il n\u2019a pas compris \u00bb, nous a-t-on dit l\u2019an dernier.

Au reste, quelle autre vision pourrait-elle \u00eatre d\u00e9velopp\u00e9e sur un tel site ? Ce que je d\u00e9plore vivement, c\u2019est que non content de s\u2019en prendre aux programmes, Nicolas Lecaussin bat en br\u00e8che le monde enseignant comme personne n\u2019oserait le faire avec telle profession ou telle population, de peur de se voir poursuivi pour discrimination voire racisme. Que dit-il en somme ? Je cite : \u00ab Dirig\u00e9 par des syndicats gauchistes et des fonctionnaires m\u00e9prisants et suffisants, notre syst\u00e8me scolaire a sombr\u00e9. Une partie des enseignants sont r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement en gr\u00e8ve et ne font que penser \u00e0 leur statut, \u00e0 leurs vacances ou \u00e0 leur d\u00e9part \u00e0 la retraite. \u00bb \u00ab Les fonctionnaires de l\u2019Education nationale reconduisent leur mod\u00e8le de gens \u00e9triqu\u00e9s, qui cherchent avant tout \u00e0 se mettre \u00e0 l'abri (fonction publique, professorat) et \u00e0 vivre si possible aux d\u00e9pens des autres. \u00bb Nul besoin d\u2019\u00eatre fin lecteur pour comprendre l\u2019id\u00e9ologie qui sous-tend de tels propos. En effet, quand on croit discerner au sein d\u2019une population une cat\u00e9gorie responsable d\u2019une nuisance ( responsabilit\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de \u00ab notre syst\u00e8me scolaire [qui] a sombr\u00e9 \u00bb, \u00ab de l\u2019\u00e9chec des jeunes \u00bb ), coupable de se comporter en parasite puisqu\u2019elle s\u2019efforce de \u00ab vivre si possible aux d\u00e9pens des autres \u00bb, ayant quelques inacceptables tares (\u00ab fonctionnaires m\u00e9prisants et suffisants \u00bb, \u00ab gens \u00e9triqu\u00e9s \u00bb), ne participant pas au bon fonctionnement de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 (\u00ab Une partie des enseignants sont r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement en gr\u00e8ve et ne font que penser \u00e0 leur statut, \u00e0 leurs vacances ou \u00e0 leur d\u00e9part \u00e0 la retraite \u00bb), quand on croit, disais-je, discerner au sein de la population une telle cat\u00e9gorie d\u2019individus, on n\u2019est pas sans rappeler certaine id\u00e9ologie des ann\u00e9es 30. Or qu\u2019en est-il r\u00e9ellement ? Je ne voudrais pas que l\u2019on puisse me soup\u00e7onner de b\u00e2tir un plaidoyer pro domo, mais enfin les enseignants sont-ils ces parasites susmentionn\u00e9s ? Sont-ils ces feignasses gangrenant la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 ? M. Lecaussin, je vous invite \u00e0 vous rendre davantage dans les \u00e9tablissements scolaires afin d\u2019y constater la vigueur du corps enseignant, lequel travaille d\u2019arrache-pied \u00e0 faire r\u00e9ussir ses \u00e9l\u00e8ves. Souvent, l\u2019enseignant se l\u00e8ve t\u00f4t ( le petit jeu des mutations ne lui a pas permis d\u2019obtenir un poste pr\u00e8s des gens qu\u2019ils aiment ), fait de longs trajets, et passe sa journ\u00e9e sur son lieu de travail, son emploi du temps ne lui permettant pas de faire autrement. Si son service n\u2019est que de 18 heures d\u2019enseignement effectif pour un certifi\u00e9, il lui faut 3 fois ce temps au moins pour se comporter en intellectuel qu\u2019il est : pour pr\u00e9parer ses cours, il lit \u00e9norm\u00e9ment, se documente, se d\u00e9place dans des mus\u00e9es, au th\u00e9\u00e2tre, au cin\u00e9ma, accumule les connaissances qui lui permettront d\u2019enrichir des cours constamment renouvel\u00e9s. Un forum comme Neoprofs vous donnera une id\u00e9e de l\u2019investissement des enseignants dans leur travail et de la hauteur de vue qui est la leur. Je n\u2019ai \u00e9videmment pas parl\u00e9 du temps consacr\u00e9 \u00e0 la correction des copies, du temps que nombre de professeurs consacrent \u00e0 la pr\u00e9paration de sorties scolaires ( je pense, entre autres, aux professeurs de langue). Je ne parlerai pas non plus du temps consacr\u00e9 \u00e0 recevoir les \u00e9l\u00e8ves et leurs parents de plus en plus enclins \u00e0 rencontrer les enseignants de leurs enfants. Enfin, on aurait pu \u00e9voquer, avec le d\u00e9veloppement d\u2019internet, le temps croissant \u00e0 diffuser des informations ( notes, cahiers de textes en ligne ) ou \u00e0 \u00e9tablir le contact avec parents et \u00e9l\u00e8ves ( forum, mails ). Faut-il \u00e9galement pr\u00e9ciser que les rares enseignants faisant gr\u00e8ve le font parce qu\u2019ils d\u00e9fendent leur vision de l\u2019\u00e9ducation, laquelle doit reposer sur une conception non pas comptable de la chose, mais sur une v\u00e9ritable politique \u00e9ducative incompatible avec la politique d\u2019\u00e9radication du fonctionnaire mis en place par le gouvernement. Ainsi, tous ceux qui font gr\u00e8ve et perdent une journ\u00e9e de salaire ne le font pas de gaiet\u00e9 de c\u0153ur en songeant aux vacances prochaines. Je pourrais continuer longtemps comme cela, et je dois \u00e9videmment en oublier, mais vous conviendrez qu\u2019on ne peut pas se laisser aussi facilement insulter.","title":"En d\u00e9couvrant l\u2019IREF, stupeur"},{"location":"%C3%89criture/Blog/Enseignement%20et%20v%C3%A9rit%C3%A9%20d%E2%80%99%C3%A9tat/","text":"\ud83d\udd17 Lien Il y a quelques jours, en lisant Le Post.fr , j\u2019ai appris que Xavier Darcos estimait qu\u2019il revenait au l\u00e9gislateur de d\u00e9finir le contenu des cours d\u2019histoire dispens\u00e9s aux \u00e9l\u00e8ves du secondaire.

L\u2019historien pr\u00e9cise Le Monde, se dit \u00ab enti\u00e8rement d\u2019accord [\u2026] pour reconna\u00eetre le droit, et m\u00eame le devoir de la collectivit\u00e9 nationale [\u2026] de se prononcer sur \u2018les rep\u00e8res historiques qu\u2019elle consid\u00e8re comme embl\u00e9matiques de son identit\u00e9' \u00bb. \u00ab Mais ces pr\u00e9rogatives, qui peuvent s\u2019exprimer par des hommages, des c\u00e9l\u00e9brations, des r\u00e9solutions, des v\u0153ux, parfois des r\u00e9parations, doivent interdire la qualification par la loi de faits historiques \u00e9rig\u00e9s ainsi en v\u00e9rit\u00e9s d\u2019\u00c9tat dont la \u2018contestation\u2019 ou la \u2018banalisation\u2019 seraient passibles des tribunaux \u00bb, ajoute-t-il. On ne saurait mieux dire.","title":"Enseignement et v\u00e9rit\u00e9 d\u2019\u00e9tat"},{"location":"%C3%89criture/Blog/F%C3%AAte%20punitive/","tags":["Blog"],"text":"\ud83d\udd17 Lien Je me souviens avoir vu une adaptation cin\u00e9matographique de L'Odyss\u00e9e (fort m\u00e9diocre au demeurant, l'adaptation naturellement pas L'Odyss\u00e9e ) dans laquelle le personnage de T\u00e9l\u00e9maque \u00e9tait jou\u00e9 par un acteur pr\u00e9pub\u00e8re au regard m\u00e9chant, probablement aigri, meurtri, par les ann\u00e9es pass\u00e9es en compagnie des pr\u00e9tendants, ce que l'on peut concevoir d'ailleurs. Il y piquait quelques vaines col\u00e8res qui le rendaient path\u00e9tique. Qu'en est-il r\u00e9ellement de ce personnage ? Je n'ai pas relu la totalit\u00e9 de L'Odyss\u00e9e , n\u00e9anmoins un passage a attir\u00e9 mon attention. Apr\u00e8s que les pr\u00e9tendants ont \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00fbment massacr\u00e9s, le fils d'Ulysse et deux serviteurs emm\u00e8nent M\u00e9lanthios, un complice des pr\u00e9tendants. Que lui font-ils ? Ils lui coupent le nez, lui tranchent les oreilles, lui arrachent les parties g\u00e9nitales qu'ils jettent aux chiens, puis lui coupent les mains et les pieds. Je vois T\u00e9l\u00e9maque diff\u00e9remment \u00e0 pr\u00e9sent. \u00c9videmment, l'adolescent est devenu un homme apr\u00e8s que son p\u00e8re est revenu. Mais quelle violence ! On pense \u00e0 Achille, dans L'Iliade, devenu fou de douleur \u00e0 la mort de Patrocle tu\u00e9 par Hector. Apr\u00e8s que tous les Ach\u00e9ens ont bless\u00e9 le corps d'Hector mort, Achille lui perce les tendons et fait 3 fois le tour de Troie en tra\u00eenant le corps sans vie de son adversaire. La folie furieuse d'Achille est la m\u00eame que celle qu'\u00e9prouve T\u00e9l\u00e9maque. Hom\u00e8re dit que le fils d'Ulysse \u00e9tait ivre de col\u00e8re. On pense enfin \u00e0 tous ces ch\u00e2timents qui rel\u00e8vent du faste punitif pour reprendre les termes de Michel Foucault dans Surveiller et punir , notamment au supplice de Damien. Accus\u00e9 de r\u00e9gicide, ce dernier a \u00e9t\u00e9 tortur\u00e9. Si ma m\u00e9moire est bonne, le bourreau - le fameux Sanson - lui tranchera la main coupable sur laquelle il versera diverses mati\u00e8res br\u00fblantes avant de l'\u00e9carteler et de jeter au corps son feu. J'\u00e9dulcore le r\u00e9cit : il faudrait dire comment le bourreau - les chevaux ne parvenant pas \u00e0 \u00e9carteler la victime - a tranch\u00e9 \u00e0 la lame les quatre membres. Pensez aussi au supplice des cent morceaux dont parle Georges Bataille dans Les Larmes d'\u00c9ros . Pour celui-ci, on a m\u00eame des photos du d\u00e9but du si\u00e8cle (Je ne les montrerai pas, Google vous r\u00e9v\u00e9lera tout ce que vous pouvez d\u00e9sirer savoir et voir). Dans ce cas pr\u00e9cis, le raffinement p\u00e9nal tient, outre son nom tr\u00e8s explicite, au maintien le plus long possible de la conscience du condamn\u00e9 par le truchement de l'opium. Dans tous ces exemples, le corps est la cible privil\u00e9gi\u00e9e de la r\u00e9pression p\u00e9nale. Aujourd'hui, le complice des pr\u00e9tendants aurait vu ses droits suspendus, une amende pharaonique ainsi qu'une peine de prison. Avec l'approbation des Dieux. \u00c0 lire enfin, le jugement des protagonistes de La guerre des boutons revu selon la proc\u00e9dure p\u00e9nale actuelle sur le site du Monde diplomatique .","title":"F\u00eate punitive"},{"location":"%C3%89criture/Blog/Il%20doit%20y%20avoir%20des%20hackers%20litt%C3%A9raires/","tags":["Blog"],"text":"\ud83d\udd17 Lien L\u2019accord sur la num\u00e9risation et la diffusion du fond de la BNF, la mon\u00e9tisation qui doit en d\u00e9couler ne laissent pas de m\u2019inqui\u00e9ter. Cela devrait d\u2019ailleurs inqui\u00e9ter tout utilisateur d\u2019internet, mais l\u2019enseignant que je suis est doublement inquiet. Il l\u2019est, bien s\u00fbr, en tant que citoyen (auquel, par ailleurs, les questions de neutralit\u00e9, d\u2019acc\u00e8s \u00e0 la culture importent), il l\u2019est en tant que professionnel de l\u2019\u00e9ducation. Voici pourquoi. Sans Wikip\u00e9dia , sans Gallica , sans tous ces sites qui donnent acc\u00e8s librement \u00e0 la litt\u00e9rature, aux illustrations, aux manuscrits, etc., je retourne \u00e0 ce qui est, pour moi, l\u2019\u00e2ge de pierre de ma profession : les ann\u00e9es 90 o\u00f9 il fallait recopier \u00e0 la main des textes, des contes entiers, les scanner, utiliser un logiciel de reconnaissance de caract\u00e8res puis les corriger. Aujourd\u2019hui, cela n\u2019est plus la peine, car il me suffit de copier et de coller un extrait de tel ou tel auteur, de le relire et, \u00e9ventuellement, de corriger telle ou telle erreur. Je gagne alors un temps pr\u00e9cieux. Imaginez le temps qu\u2019il faut pour recopier ne serait-ce qu\u2019 un conte de Voltaire ! J\u2019ai trouv\u00e9 un autre moyen de jouir (professionnellement) de Wikip\u00e9dia ou Gallica . Ai-je \u00e0 faire un exercice sur les propositions subordonn\u00e9es relatives ? Voudrais-je quelques exemples litt\u00e9raires de bon aloi qui en imposeront davantage que mes petites phrases invent\u00e9es pour l\u2019occasion ? Vais-je relire des milliers de pages pour trouver le bon exemple litt\u00e9raire ? Que nenni ! On ouvre, dans Gallica ou Wikip\u00e9dia une page de Chateaubriand, de Zola ou de n\u2019importe quel auteur, on fait un cmd (ou clic) + f, on tape quelques mots clefs et l\u2019on trouve tout ce que l\u2019on cherche en un clin d\u2019\u0153il. Des centaines de propositions apparaissent surlign\u00e9es. Combien de temps, d\u2019heures, de jours ai-je gagn\u00e9s en ayant \u00e0 ma disposition tout ceci? Ce temps, entre autres, m\u2019a permis, par exemple, de concevoir des manuels libres et gratuits . D\u2019ailleurs, ces manuels ont vu le jour parce que le partage de la culture, le libre ( Aaron Swartz , je te salue au passage) m\u2019ont permis d\u2019acc\u00e9der \u00e0 tout un pan de notre culture, celui-l\u00e0 m\u00eame qui \u00e9tait auparavant enferm\u00e9 dans les coffres des grandes biblioth\u00e8ques, oubli\u00e9, car ne faisant plus l\u2019objet de publication peu rentable, expos\u00e9 dans des mus\u00e9es lointains ou des collections priv\u00e9es, etc. Priv\u00e9s de tout cela, mes manuels ressembleraient, apr\u00e8s en avoir accouch\u00e9 dans la douleur du scanner et de l\u2019OCR, \u00e0 de vagues et exsangues photocopies d\u00e9pourvues d\u2019illustrations. Or Apple m\u2019avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 signifi\u00e9 que les mots \u00ablibre\u00bb et \u00abgratuit\u00bb n\u2019\u00e9taient pas les bienvenus sur la couverture d\u2019un livre expos\u00e9 sur son store. Tr\u00e8s bien. Faut-il que dor\u00e9navant il n\u2019y ait plus rien de libre ni de gratuit ? Que les incunables (vous savez ceux qui sont \u00abant\u00e9rieurs \u00e0 1500\u00bb . Appr\u00e9ciez la tautologie) soient commercialis\u00e9s ? bard\u00e9s de DRM ? Savez-vous ce que cela signifie pour tous ces pays \u2013 je pense notamment \u00e0 certains pays d\u2019Afrique, du Maghreb \u2013 qui b\u00e9n\u00e9ficient gratuitement et librement de cette somme ? Bien des fois, lors de l\u2019\u00e9laboration de mes manuels, je me suis dit que le droit d\u2019auteur avait \u00e9t\u00e9 invent\u00e9, non pas pour nourrir les ayants droit, mais pour engraisser des \u00e9diteurs confisquant des \u0153uvres d\u2019auteurs morts depuis pr\u00e8s de cent ans (un vrai conte !). Mais ceux qui le sont depuis un demi-mill\u00e9naire, faut-il qu\u2019ils le soient \u00e9galement ? Faudra-t-il payer pour les lire ? En ce cas, il faudra faire ce qu\u2019a fait Aaron Swartz , il faudra piller le catalogue et le mettre en ligne.

Il me reste un dernier point \u00e0 d\u00e9velopper : les raisons de mon d\u00e9saccord avec votre vision du monde ou du moins de l\u2019\u00e9ducation. Ma diatribe \u00e9tant d\u2019objectif modeste, je me limiterai au seul point d\u2019intersection possible : l\u2019\u00e9cole pr\u00e9pare-t-elle \u00e0 rentrer dans votre monde, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire dans celui de l\u2019entreprise ? L\u2019introduction qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8de votre article pr\u00e9cise que vous invitez les jeunes \u00e0 devenir entrepreneur. C\u2019est \u00e0 coup s\u00fbr un bel objectif, et je me satisfais de constater que vos ambitions sont sans limites, puisque vous leur offrez l\u2019exemple de Larry Page et de Sergey Brin. Mais, d\u2019embl\u00e9e, je me dis que nous ne vivons pas dans le m\u00eame monde car, dans le coll\u00e8ge dans lequel je travaille, pas moins de 52 % des \u00e9l\u00e8ves sont issus d\u2019un milieu d\u00e9favoris\u00e9. C\u2019est vous dire qu\u2019ils ne sont pas pr\u00eats \u00e0 balancer de leur garage l\u2019algorithme qui va bouleverser le monde. Je ne vais certes pas b\u00e2tir mon argumentation sur un mis\u00e9rabilisme larmoyant, mais il serait int\u00e9ressant que vous les voyiez ces jeunes, et que vous compreniez que leurs pr\u00e9occupations sont \u00e0 mille lieues des v\u00f4tres. Vous semblez r\u00eaver d\u2019une jeunesse galopante et rayonnante d\u00e9barrass\u00e9e de ces enseignants parasitaires freinant son \u00e9lan. H\u00e9las ! ce jeune public est davantage concern\u00e9 par ses petits probl\u00e8mes : un parent qui vient de se suicider, un autre qui a mis son enfant \u00e0 la porte, un abus sexuel, une dyslexie mal trait\u00e9e, etc. Malgr\u00e9 tout cela, ces enfants parfois en tr\u00e8s grande difficult\u00e9 scolaire sont contrairement \u00e0 ce que vous dites ponctuels, polis et respectueux. En revanche, ils accroissent les \u00abbataillons d\u2019illettr\u00e9s\u00bb dont vous parlez. \u00c0 qui la faute ? Cela, c\u2019est pour remettre les choses dans leur contexte, et je peux vous dire que j\u2019ai grandement \u00e9dulcor\u00e9 les choses. \u00c0 pr\u00e9sent, demandons-nous ce que ces coll\u00e9giens deviennent. J\u2019en viendrai directement au point qui nous int\u00e9resse : les \u00abmeilleurs\u00bb vont au lyc\u00e9e, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire presque tous. Comment pourrait-il en aller autrement ? Lorsqu\u2019on veut emmener 80% d\u2019une classe d\u2019\u00e2ge au baccalaur\u00e9at, il n\u2019est pas \u00e9tonnant que ce soit pratiquement tous nos \u00e9l\u00e8ves qui acc\u00e8dent au lyc\u00e9e. Au reste, je maintiens que cet objectif n\u2019a rien de scandaleux, sauf pour les nostalgiques du charme discret de la bourgeoisie, qui aimaient tant que l\u2019\u00e9lite soit l\u2019\u00e9lite, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire une cat\u00e9gorie sociale non souill\u00e9e de la pr\u00e9sence des prol\u00e9taires venant outrageusement faire baisser le niveau. Nos coll\u00e9giens deviennent donc des lyc\u00e9ens en acc\u00e9dant soit au lyc\u00e9e g\u00e9n\u00e9ral et technique soit au lyc\u00e9e professionnel. Le deuxi\u00e8me choix, car c\u2019est presque toujours un deuxi\u00e8me choix, voit des \u00e9l\u00e8ves arriver qui n\u2019ont pas envie d\u2019\u00eatre l\u00e0. Aujourd\u2019hui, on consid\u00e8re toujours qu\u2019il vaut mieux faire de la philosophie que de la m\u00e9canique, rappelle Fran\u00e7ois Dubet. C\u2019est dire que ces \u00e9l\u00e8ves \u00e0 qui on a fait comprendre que le lyc\u00e9e g\u00e9n\u00e9ral et technique n\u2019\u00e9tait pas pour eux n\u2019ont pas envie d\u2019\u00eatre l\u00e0. Bien souvent, ils y sont malgr\u00e9 eux. C\u2019est dommage, mais c\u2019est ainsi. Quelles peuvent \u00eatre alors leurs motivations ? \u00c0 eux dont les m\u00e9dias rab\u00e2chent \u00e0 longueur de journ\u00e9e que de grands patrons s\u2019octroient des salaires pharaoniques, parfois doubles, avant de fermer l\u2019entreprise pour ensuite d\u00e9localiser. Quelle est \u00e0 votre avis leur opinion sur le monde de l\u2019entreprise, eux qui voient papa et maman ch\u00f4mer ? Le probl\u00e8me est donc l\u00e0 : l\u2019\u00e9cole n\u2019est plus un gage de r\u00e9ussite. Tant et si bien qu\u2019on ne sait plus comment motiver nos \u00e9l\u00e8ves. Dans certains cas, on propose m\u00eame des cagnottes de 10000\u20ac. C\u2019est vous dire le d\u00e9sarroi qui a d\u00fb s\u2019emparer des t\u00eates pensantes de notre minist\u00e8re. Mais quand bien m\u00eame le monde qui les attend regorgerait d\u2019emplois \u00e0 qui mieux mieux, qu\u2019en serait-il exactement ? Faudrait-il pr\u00e9parer nos \u00e9l\u00e8ves \u00e0 rentrer dans la vie active ? Pour moi, et je ne me lasserai jamais de le r\u00e9p\u00e9ter, la r\u00e9ponse est non, mille fois non. Les \u00e9l\u00e8ves eux-m\u00eames le savent, eux qui effectuent leur scolarit\u00e9. L\u2019univers dans lequel ils \u00e9voluent - celui de l\u2019\u00e9cole - n\u2019est pas la r\u00e9alit\u00e9. C\u2019est un monde \u00e0 part dans lequel l\u2019erreur est tol\u00e9r\u00e9e, la faute acceptable. C\u2019est un monde dans lequel on peut recommencer sans \u00eatre condamn\u00e9, m\u00e9pris\u00e9 ou ostracis\u00e9 : si je rate un contr\u00f4le, je peux le recommencer, je peux refaire une ann\u00e9e, je peux recevoir de l\u2019aide ; si, d\u2019aventure, je commets une b\u00eatise (je me bats, par exemple) je ne paie pas d\u2019amende, je ne vais pas en prison. Je suis \u00e9duqu\u00e9, \u00e9lev\u00e9, non pas condamn\u00e9. Il n\u2019existe qu\u2019un seul cas o\u00f9 le r\u00e9el rencontre l\u2019\u00e9cole : c\u2019est lorsqu\u2019un enfant ayant commis et r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e9 de graves forfaits se voit tra\u00een\u00e9 en conseil de discipline et que celui-ci se prononce pour l\u2019exclusion d\u00e9finitive de l\u2019\u00e9l\u00e8ve. L\u00e0, en voyant le regard de l\u2019enfant, on comprend qu\u2019il n\u2019avait pas saisi que le r\u00e9el le rattrapait. Le r\u00e9el ! Le moins que l\u2019on puisse dire est qu\u2019il varie en fonction de divers facteurs. Qu\u2019est-ce que cela veut dire le r\u00e9el, et surtout pr\u00e9parer nos enfants au monde r\u00e9el? Au XVIIe si\u00e8cle, cela ne voulait s\u00fbrement pas dire grand-chose : un \u00e9tat dans lequel tout un chacun aurait re\u00e7u une \u00e9ducation, aurait son mot \u00e0 dire dans une d\u00e9mocratie serait un non-sens. Apr\u00e8s la R\u00e9volution fran\u00e7aise, les choses sont un peu diff\u00e9rentes, mais combien de petits Fran\u00e7ais re\u00e7oivent les lumi\u00e8res de l\u2019\u00e9ducation ? Ce n\u2019est que progressivement, au XIXe si\u00e8cle, que les Fran\u00e7ais vont acc\u00e9der de plus en plus nombreux \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9cole, mais pourquoi faire ? L\u2019enfant apprend \u00e0 compter, \u00e0 lire et \u00e0 \u00e9crire. Cela est bien suffisant, et de toute fa\u00e7on la moisson mobilisera bient\u00f4t toute l\u2019\u00e9nergie de la famille. Dans l\u2019industrialisation croissante de ce si\u00e8cle, \u00e0 quoi faut-il pr\u00e9parer les enfants ? Au travail que le monde est en mesure de leur donner ? \u00c0 travailler dans une mine, \u00e0 travailler dans une manufacture ? \u00c0 faire la guerre pour lutter contre les Prussiens ? Ce qui n\u2019est pas encore l\u2019\u00c9ducation nationale n\u2019a-t-il pour autre objectif que de pr\u00e9parer l\u2019enfant \u00e0 recevoir ce que le monde veut bien lui donner ? Dans le n\u00f4tre, que faudrait-il apprendre ? \u00c0 m\u00e9priser La Princesse de Cl\u00e8ves, \u00e0 s\u2019adapter \u00e0 telle technologie tant que nous en avons besoin (pensez aux cassettes vid\u00e9o de Sony dans les Landes), puis \u00e0 les mettre \u00e0 la porte ? Ce n\u2019est pas l\u00e0 ma conception de l\u2019\u00e9cole. Mieux encore. Selon moi, l\u2019\u00e9cole est incompatible avec la logique de l\u2019entreprise et de l\u2019id\u00e9ologie du lib\u00e9ralisme qui voit ou veut voir dans l\u2019individu un \u00eatre comp\u00e9titif, pr\u00eat \u00e0 \u00e9craser l\u2019autre, ce qui est bien, en derni\u00e8re analyse, l\u2019exemple que vous donnez en \u00e9voquant Larry Page et Sergey Brin. Ne sont-ils pas \u00e0 l\u2019origine de l\u2019entreprise qui, tel un monstre mythologique, avale tout, diminue ou \u00e9crase la concurrence c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire des individus ? Or rien de tel dans une classe. Si l\u2019on fait de la p\u00e9dagogie diff\u00e9renci\u00e9e, la classe est divis\u00e9e en petits groupes m\u00ealant les \u00e9l\u00e8ves dont les meilleurs aident les moins forts. Il faudrait d\u2019ailleurs s\u2019entendre sur ce terme : le meilleur dans une classe n\u2019est pas forc\u00e9ment le plus intelligent, mais parfois le plus chanceux, le plus m\u00fbr, le plus s\u00e9rieux, le plus docile (ou le moins r\u00e9fractaire), celui qui est passionn\u00e9 ou seulement int\u00e9ress\u00e9. Dans un tel contexte, ledit meilleur n\u2019a pas pour objectif d\u2019\u00e9craser l\u2019autre, mais bien de l\u2019aider. Et tout l\u2019enjeu de mon enseignement sera de le leur expliquer. Je tenterai \u00e9galement de leur parler de tout ce qui sera profond\u00e9ment inutile, la litt\u00e9rature. Vous qui aimez l\u2019\u00e9conomie, permettez-moi d\u2019y faire r\u00e9f\u00e9rence. L\u2019enseignement de la litt\u00e9rature, c\u2019est l\u2019\u00e9quivalent de ce que Georges Bataille appelait la part maudite, la d\u00e9pense pour rien. Il n\u2019y a rien de plus d\u00e9testable que cette instrumentalisation de l\u2019\u00e9cole, sa subordination au monde du travail. L\u2019enseignement n\u2019est pas utilitaire. Je n\u2019enr\u00f4le pas de futurs ch\u00f4meurs.","title":"Il faut conna\u00eetre l\u2019entreprise d\u00e8s le lyc\u00e9e.

Parfois, ce sont les \u00e9l\u00e8ves qui sont tous dot\u00e9s d'un ordinateur portable, parfois l'enseignant inscrit les absences sur le sien, communiquant ainsi directement avec la vie scolaire (ce dont t\u00e9moigne le blog d'une coll\u00e8gue). D'ailleurs, on a vu jusqu'o\u00f9 pouvait aller l'in\u00e9galit\u00e9 avec l'internat d'excellence de Sourdun... Alors je m\u2019interroge : dans quelles conditions mat\u00e9rielles enseigne-t-on dans un coll\u00e8ge ? Comment les collectivit\u00e9s territoriales traitent-elles la question ? D\u2019aucuns ont du mat\u00e9riel en abondance disais-je. Nous on en est \u00e0 rechercher la chaise sur laquelle s\u2019asseoir, celle dont la soudure n\u2019a pas l\u00e2ch\u00e9 \u00e0 nouveau. Je ne peux \u00e9voquer la moquette marron de la salle des profs, puisque celle-ci va \u00eatre refaite dans le cadre des travaux de r\u00e9novation que je photographie de temps \u00e0 autre (j\u2019y reviendrais plus bas), mais j\u2019\u00e9voquerais la question de l\u2019informatique au coll\u00e8ge. Faisons un inventaire. Dans notre \u00e9tablissement, on a une salle informatique, mais elle est constitu\u00e9e de PC (beurk) sous Windows XP (beurk, beurk et beurk) en nombre \u00e9videmment insuffisant pour une classe d'une vingtaine d'\u00e9l\u00e8ves, inutilisable a fortiori pour mes trente \u00e9l\u00e8ves de quatri\u00e8me. Un g\u00e9nie a \u00e9lu le logiciel Campus (mille fois beurk) pour rentrer nos notes (comment va-t-on faire quand il faudra appliquer le socle commun de comp\u00e9tences ?), remplir un cahier de textes dont l'interface est digne d'un logiciel des ann\u00e9es 90 (et en informatique, c'est un peu comme les chiens. Chaque ann\u00e9e compte pour 7). Au reste, personne ne le lit ce cahier de textes, puisque les parents n\u2019ont pas d\u2019identifiant ni de mot de passe. Je le remplis donc pour la beaut\u00e9 du geste. \u00c9voquons tout de m\u00eame les trois machines de la salle des profs : cette ann\u00e9e, un informaticien du rectorat a eu la bonne id\u00e9e de virer Novell et Zenworks (ou un truc dans le genre) qui plombaient la machine que ses 128 voire 250 Mo de m\u00e9moire ne parvenaient pas \u00e0 faire tourner, mais on garde Windows XP, et on nous gratifie d\u2019un espace disque de 200 Mo environ pour y mettre nos petits, petits, petits fichiers. \u00c9videmment, un superbe \u00e9cran 17 pouces \u00e0 tube cathodique, r\u00e9gl\u00e9 de fa\u00e7on \u00e0 ce que m\u00eame une personne mal voyant s\u2019\u00e9tonne de la grosseur des caract\u00e8res, nous oblige \u00e0 faire d\u00e9filer les pages de haut en bas, de gauche \u00e0 droite et inversement et encore inversement, pour en lire le contenu. J\u2019ach\u00e8verais cet inventaire avec les ordinateurs des salles de techno, dont l\u2019obsolescence permet le minimum du minimum (c\u2019est Windows 98 et 64 voire 128 Mo). Bon, il faut tout de m\u00eame reconna\u00eetre que les vid\u00e9o-projecteurs se multiplient. C\u2019est le Conseil g\u00e9n\u00e9ral qui fournit le mat\u00e9riel, un mat\u00e9riel syst\u00e9matiquement m\u00e9diocre et toujours obsol\u00e8te. Je me demande m\u00eame comment ils parviennent encore \u00e0 trouver des \u00e9crans \u00e0 tube cathodique. Seul le conseil g\u00e9n\u00e9ral parvient \u00e0 en d\u00e9nicher. Bref, de la volont\u00e9 de nos \u00e9lus, d\u00e9pendent le bon fonctionnement de notre \u00e9tablissement. S\u2019ils ne veulent pas, on n\u2019a pas. Et l\u2019\u00e9pisode du parking - si \u00e7a int\u00e9resse quelqu\u2019un, je raconte - r\u00e9v\u00e8le qu\u2019ils font ce qu\u2019ils veulent au Conseil g\u00e9n\u00e9ral. Pourtant, des travaux ont d\u00e9but\u00e9 p\u00e9niblement. En revanche, je crains que cela ne soit qu\u2019une fa\u00e7ade derri\u00e8re laquelle il n\u2019y aura pas grand-chose.","title":"Inqui\u00e9tude"},{"location":"%C3%89criture/Blog/Internet%20explorer%208/","text":"\ud83d\udd17 Lien Internet explorer est un pi\u00e8tre navigateur.

Je ne sais pas \u00e0 quoi cela est d\u00fb (vraiment je ne vois pas...), mais j\u2019ai une f\u00e2cheuse tendance \u00e0 penser que je ne peux plus faire comme avant, qu\u2019il est temps de changer de comportement. D\u2019une certaine fa\u00e7on, c\u2019est un peu comme \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque o\u00f9 on ne faisait pas de sauvegardes. C\u2019\u00e9tait l\u2019insouciance. Et puis, un jour, il est devenu \u00e9vident que cela \u00e9tait n\u00e9cessaire, que si l\u2019on voulait conserver toutes ces pr\u00e9cieuses choses que l\u2019on confie \u00e0 sa machine, il fallait vraiment prendre conscience de la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 de les sauvegarder. Pas seulement sur un disque externe quand on veut bien y penser, mais quotidiennement. Une bonne sauvegarde incr\u00e9mentale et automatique ! Pour ma part, j\u2019en ai deux : une avec Time Machine, une autre avec Personnal Backup. Deux disques durs donc. Et une autre sur internet, car si ma maison br\u00fble, mes sauvegardes \u00e9galement ! Alors j\u2019envoie tout ce \u00e0 quoi je tiens sur internet. Mais c\u2019est une sauvegarde chiffr\u00e9e, parce que je ne veux pas que tout le monde puisse intercepter mes donn\u00e9es. C\u2019est tellement facile de sniffer le r\u00e9seau... Et voil\u00e0 que je me mets \u00e0 m\u2019inqui\u00e9ter de nouveau. \u00c9videmment, on me r\u00e9pondra que pas grand-monde ne s\u2019int\u00e9resse aux photos de la petite derni\u00e8re ou d\u2019ailleurs \u00e0 tout ce qui m\u2019est personnel. Et, de fait, internet regorge de r\u00e9flexions de ce genre. Elles pullulent beno\u00eetement : \u00ab Je n\u2019ai rien \u00e0 cacher \u00bb, \u00ab Les VPN servent \u00e0 cacher que je n\u2019ai rien \u00e0 cacher \u00bb, et autres r\u00e9flexions de ce genre qui justifient toutes les intrusions dans notre vie priv\u00e9e sous le pr\u00e9texte que nous n\u2019avons rien \u00e0 cacher. Pourquoi s\u2019inqui\u00e9ter \u29eb Je n\u2019ai donc effectivement rien \u00e0 cacher, mais c\u2019est encore \u00e0 moi de d\u00e9terminer si ce rien doit \u00eatre expos\u00e9 ou cach\u00e9 voire exploit\u00e9 dans une base de donn\u00e9es \u00e0 des fins publicitaires. Alors que je me demandais comment chiffrer mes emails, je suis tomb\u00e9 sur cet article (http://www.gbronner.net/mail/cryptoMail.html) expliquant pourquoi nous devrions les chiffrer. L\u2019auteur y explique que, faisant son service militaire dans les transmissions, \u00ab les standardistes avaient branch\u00e9 un amplificateur de guitare sur la ligne d'une des cabines publiques \u00bb... Et tout le monde de se marrer en \u00e9coutant les conversations (voir notamment la partie \u00abBon, d\u2019accord. Mais qui aurait int\u00e9r\u00eat \u00e0 lire mes courriels ? Je n\u2019ai rien \u00e0 cacher\u00bb (http://www.gbronner.net/mail/cryptoMail.html#rienacacher)). Mince alors... R\u00e9cemment, la lecture de ces quelques articles a achev\u00e9 de me convaincre : l\u2019un de Numerama sur les Big Brother conviviaux (http://www.numerama.com/magazine/19103-pour-la-cnil-facebook-et-google-sont-des-big-brother-conviviaux.html), l\u2019autre de la CNIL (http://www.cnil.fr/vos-libertes/vos-traces/) proposant de vous r\u00e9v\u00e9ler vos traces, un autre enfin de Numerama encore sur un rapport de l\u2019ONU non approuv\u00e9 par la France (http://www.numerama.com/magazine/19067-41-pays-approuvent-le-rapport-de-l-onu-sur-la-liberte-et-internet-pas-la-france.html). Mais, \u00e0 dire vrai, il n\u2019y a rien de nouveau. Le jour o\u00f9 j\u2019ai d\u00e9couvert tout ce que Google Analytics r\u00e9v\u00e9lait sur nos visites, j\u2019ai \u00e9t\u00e9 effar\u00e9. Sinc\u00e8rement, \u00e0 part votre nom et votre adresse, que manque-t-il ? Je sais combien de temps vous \u00eates rest\u00e9 sur mon site, comment vous y \u00eates arriv\u00e9, sur quelle page vous avez quitt\u00e9 le site, combien de pages vous avez visit\u00e9es, je connais votre syst\u00e8me d\u2019exploitation, votre navigateur, la r\u00e9solution de votre \u00e9cran, la version de flash install\u00e9, etc., etc. Au moment m\u00eame o\u00f9 j\u2019\u00e9cris ces lignes, je trouve sans cesse de nouvelles raisons de conforter mon opinion (la neutralit\u00e9 du net en une image http://psychologik.blogspot.com/2011/06/linternet-cest-comme-les-psy-cest-mieux.html, L\u2019internet europ\u00e9en \u00e0 la carte http://owni.fr/2011/05/25/carte-internet-europe-regulation-filtrage-copyright-droit-liberte-utilisateurs/). Et on se prend \u00e0 constater que les choses ne sont pas pr\u00eates de s\u2019arranger... ![[neutralit\u00e9 du web.jpg]] Au diable les filtres ! \u29eb Et il existe encore une autre raison de s\u2019interroger sur la mani\u00e8re \u00e0 laquelle on acc\u00e8de \u00e0 internet. C\u2019est lorsque l\u2019on est confront\u00e9 aux filtres. Qui n\u2019a jamais pest\u00e9 contre un web filtr\u00e9 ? \u00c0 en juger d\u2019apr\u00e8s les nombreuses r\u00e9actions ou demandes de coll\u00e8gues, on peut penser qu\u2019ils sont nombreux ceux \u00e0 qui l\u2019on d\u00e9nie et le plein acc\u00e8s au web et la capacit\u00e9 \u00e0 d\u00e9cider par eux-m\u00eames ce qu\u2019ils peuvent voir et ce qu\u2019ils ne peuvent pas voir. En ce qui me concerne, je ne comprends pas un traitre mot au discours qui m\u2019est tenu \u00e0 propos du filtrage du net : dans un \u00e9tablissement scolaire, il s\u2019agirait d\u2019emp\u00eacher les \u00e9l\u00e8ves (et a fortiori les enseignants) d\u2019acc\u00e9der \u00e0 des sites qui n\u2019auraient aucun int\u00e9r\u00eat p\u00e9dagogique. Ah !? Parce qu\u2019il y a quelqu\u2019un, quelque part, sachant ce qui rev\u00eat un int\u00e9r\u00eat p\u00e9dagogique ou pas ? Parce que moi je l\u2019ignore (je ne parle \u00e9videmment pas de tout ce que la morale r\u00e9prouve et qu\u2019il est plut\u00f4t facile de bannir). Peut-on m\u00eame savoir quel chemin l\u2019activit\u00e9 p\u00e9dagogique va-t-elle emprunter ? Moi, je fais feu de tout bois : Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, un obscur blog, un improbable site, tel ou tel forum nourrissent ma r\u00e9flexion et stimulent mon d\u00e9sir d\u2019enseigner. En revanche, quand je tombe sur une page m\u2019expliquant que je n\u2019ai pas le droit d\u2019acc\u00e9der \u00e0 telle page parce que quelqu\u2019un quelque part en a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 ainsi, cela me fait sortir de mes gonds. Je me suis d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu \u00e0 plusieurs reprises refuser l\u2019acc\u00e8s \u00e0 tel ou tel site parce qu\u2019on avait pens\u00e9 que ce n\u2019\u00e9tait pas p\u00e9dagogique. Eh quoi ! Rapha\u00ebl ou Waterhouse ne seraient pas p\u00e9dagogiques (si si, \u00e7a m\u2019est arriv\u00e9) ? Une recherche sur les composants vieillissants de la machine qui m\u2019est confi\u00e9e est interdite ? Que de fois je n\u2019ai pu voir tel ou tel site parce que le filtrage est mal con\u00e7u, parce qu\u2019il est inefficace ? Car il faut bien le constater : on trouve durant sa navigation sur le web ce qu\u2019il ne faudrait pas, et on y trouve pas ce qu\u2019il faudrait... Au diable les filtres donc ! J\u2019ai alors recherch\u00e9 ce qui me permettrait de naviguer sur internet sans laisser tant de traces. J\u2019ai aussi cherch\u00e9 ce qui me permettrait d\u2019utiliser internet sans avoir \u00e0 subir les limitations impos\u00e9es par un administrateur r\u00e9seau. Il faut dire qu\u2019on en parlait beaucoup au moment des r\u00e9volutions tunisiennes et \u00e9gyptiennes. En 2005, Reporters sans fronti\u00e8res avait \u00e0 ce sujet publi\u00e9 un tr\u00e8s int\u00e9ressant guide (http://www.aidh.org/ONG/rsf-guide-dissident.htm), Le Guide pratique du blogger et du cyberdissident qu\u2019il est temps de ressortir ! Quelque temps avant, Hadopi puis Lopsi soulevaient chez les internautes de nombreuses et l\u00e9gitimes questions. Donc, de mani\u00e8re g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, je veux pouvoir naviguer sur internet en toute s\u00e9curit\u00e9 et privaut\u00e9, cela de fa\u00e7on priv\u00e9e et sans limitation. Comment faire ? Voici quelques r\u00e9ponses. Mais notez bien que mon objectif n\u2019est pas de vous expliquer le fonctionnement des diff\u00e9rents logiciels que je vais \u00e9voquer, mais de vous indiquer qu\u2019ils existent, et peut-\u00eatre de vous inciter \u00e0 les utiliser. Firefox \u29eb Votre navigateur vous permet-il d\u2019acc\u00e9der \u00e0 internet sans avertir la terre enti\u00e8re de ce que vous faites ? Rien n\u2019est moins s\u00fbr... Il me semble que la premi\u00e8re des choses \u00e0 faire est d\u2019adopter la recherche SSL (https://encrypted.google.com/webhp?hl=fr). Tout ce que vous recherchez sur Google est alors chiffr\u00e9 (encrypt\u00e9 comme l\u2019on dit si mal). Ni l\u2019administrateur r\u00e9seau, ni votre fournisseur d\u2019acc\u00e8s \u00e0 internet ne pourront (a priori) savoir ce que vous faites (pour en savoir plus sur Google SSL : https://www.google.com/support/websearch/bin/answer.py?answer=173733&hl=fr). Ensuite, je vous recommande Firefox, pour lequel il existe une s\u00e9rie de plugins destin\u00e9s aux plus paranos d\u2019entre nous. On ne pr\u00e9sente \u00e9videmment plus l\u2019indispensable Adblocks qui supprime toutes les publicit\u00e9s intempestives (https://addons.mozilla.org/fr/firefox/addon/adblock-plus/). Pr\u00e9cisons au passage que si vous utilisez Hotspot Shield (un VPN gratuit http://hotspotshield.com/), vous ne serez pas g\u00ean\u00e9s par les publicit\u00e9s qu\u2019il vous impose en contrepartie de sa gratuit\u00e9. Parce que certains scripts exploitent des failles de s\u00e9curit\u00e9, NoScript (https://addons.mozilla.org/fr/firefox/addon/noscript/) ne permet l\u2019utilisation du JavaScript que sur les sites pour lesquels vous avez confiance, BetterPrivacy (https://addons.mozilla.org/fr/firefox/addon/betterprivacy/) se charge des cookies divulguant vos habitudes de navigation, HTTPS-Everywhere (https://www.eff.org/https-everywhere) est \u00e0 utiliser pour les m\u00eames raisons que j\u2019ai expos\u00e9es ci-dessus \u00e0 propos de Google, mais cette fois \u00e9tendues aux autres sites : vous utiliserez https pour tous les sites ou presque (remarquez que Twitter propose cela dans les param\u00e8tres). Je vous conseille donc vivement ces plugins, mais sachez qu\u2019il en existe bien d\u2019autres (https://addons.mozilla.org/fr/firefox/?browse=featured). Tor \u29eb En plus de tout cela, une solution simple consiste \u00e0 installer Tor (https://www.torproject.org/projects/vidalia.html) sur votre ordinateur. C\u2019est d\u2019une simplicit\u00e9 enfantine, \u00e0 condition d\u2019avoir un plein acc\u00e8s \u00e0 votre machine, et non \u00e0 un espace allou\u00e9 sur un serveur avec des droits limit\u00e9s. Et encore ! Si d\u2019aventure vous ne pouvez rien installer sur votre ordinateur, vous avez toujours la possibilit\u00e9 d\u2019utiliser Tor (https://www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser.html) sur une clef USB. Il n\u2019y aucune installation. Juste \u00e0 d\u00e9placer ce que vous aurez t\u00e9l\u00e9charg\u00e9 sur ladite clef (pour le reste, voyez la vid\u00e9o sur le dernier lien). Vous pourrez alors surfer (relativement) anonymement durant votre navigation sur le web et acc\u00e9der \u00e0 ce que bon vous semble. Comme on peut le voir gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 cette capture d\u2019\u00e9cran, la CNIL pense que mon adresse IP est 80.237.226.74 alors que ma v\u00e9ritable adresse est ... (je ne vais quand m\u00eame pas vous donner mon adresse) , et m\u00eame que je viens de Hambourg ! ![[CNIL.jpg]] Si toutefois vous avez des difficult\u00e9s \u00e0 installer Tor - ou plus exactement Vidalia (https://www.torproject.org/projects/vidalia.html), voyez le site Journal de bord (http://www.bicus.fr/blog/files/TOR.php) qui vous expliquera \u00e0 la fois ce qu\u2019est Tor et comment configurer votre r\u00e9seau, le proxy notamment (les explications sont destin\u00e9es aux utilisateurs de Macs, mais vous pouvez sans trop de difficult\u00e9s les adapter \u00e0 Windows). Les VPN \u29eb Je vous l\u2019ai dit, je ne vais pas vous expliquer tout cela, sans quoi cet article deviendrait excessivement long. Si vous ne savez pas ce qu\u2019est un VPN (Virtual Private Network), lisez l\u2019article de Wikip\u00e9dia (https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/fr/wiki/R%C3%A9seau_priv%C3%A9_virtuel) ou encore Le blog du VPN (http://www.vpnblog.net/). ![[VPN (wikip\u00e9dia).jpg]] Si vous savez que ce \u00abtunnel\u00bb vous permet de naviguer de fa\u00e7on confidentielle, vous voudrez peut-\u00eatre savoir lequel choisir. Le moins que l\u2019on puisse dire est qu\u2019il y a pl\u00e9thore. Ce site (http://korben.info/choisir-son-vpn.html) (b\u00e9ni soit-il) vous propose un large \u00e9ventail de choix. Certains sont payants, d\u2019autres non. J\u2019ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9voqu\u00e9 Hotspot Shield. Il est gratuit. HydeMyNet (http://www.hidemynet.com/) semble conna\u00eetre un certain succ\u00e8s. J\u2019utilise actuellement VPNTUNNEL (https://www.vpntunnel.se/). En tout cas, le m\u00e9rite du VPN est certain : si vous voyagez en Chine, si vous voulez acc\u00e9der \u00e0 des sites de streaming en anglais, le VPN est fait pour vous (pour 5 $ par mois). Attention, on ne vous autorise pas pour autant \u00e0 faire du P2P (donc du t\u00e9l\u00e9chargement ill\u00e9gal). Les mails \u29eb Chiffrer ses mails n\u2019est pas forc\u00e9ment \u00e9vident. Cet article (http://www.gbronner.net/mail/cryptoMail.html) vous expliquera tout ce que vous avez besoin de savoir. Le meilleur moyen de le faire est GnuPG (http://www.gnupg.org/), mais ce n\u2019est franchement pas simple \u00e0 mettre en place. Il est plus sage d\u2019envisager l\u2019achat d\u2019un certificat (http://www.gbronner.net/mail/smimeEasy.html) (ce que Mail ou tout autre logiciel de messagerie g\u00e8rent tr\u00e8s bien). Sur Mac, ce petit logiciel (payant) est fort sympathique (http://www.macgeneration.com/news/voir/134699/encrypt-mail-envoie-des-mails-securises) et fait tr\u00e8s bien l\u2019affaire.

C\u2019est lorsque l\u2019on est confront\u00e9 aux filtres. Qui n\u2019a jamais pest\u00e9 contre un web filtr\u00e9 ? \u00c0 en juger d\u2019apr\u00e8s les nombreuses r\u00e9actions ou demandes de coll\u00e8gues, on peut penser qu\u2019ils sont nombreux ceux \u00e0 qui l\u2019on d\u00e9nie et le plein acc\u00e8s au web et la capacit\u00e9 \u00e0 d\u00e9cider par eux-m\u00eames ce qu\u2019ils peuvent voir et ce qu\u2019ils ne peuvent pas voir. En ce qui me concerne, je ne comprends pas un traitre mot au discours qui m\u2019est tenu \u00e0 propos du filtrage du net : dans un \u00e9tablissement scolaire, il s\u2019agirait d\u2019emp\u00eacher les \u00e9l\u00e8ves (et a fortiori les enseignants) d\u2019acc\u00e9der \u00e0 des sites qui n\u2019auraient aucun int\u00e9r\u00eat p\u00e9dagogique. Ah !? Parce qu\u2019il y a quelqu\u2019un, quelque part, sachant ce qui rev\u00eat un int\u00e9r\u00eat p\u00e9dagogique ou pas ? Parce que moi je l\u2019ignore (je ne parle \u00e9videmment pas de tout ce que la morale r\u00e9prouve et qu\u2019il est plut\u00f4t facile de bannir). Peut-on m\u00eame savoir quel chemin l\u2019activit\u00e9 p\u00e9dagogique va-t-elle emprunter ? Moi, je fais feu de tout bois : Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, un obscur blog, un improbable site, tel ou tel forum nourrissent ma r\u00e9flexion et stimulent mon d\u00e9sir d\u2019enseigner. En revanche, quand je tombe sur une page m\u2019expliquant que je n\u2019ai pas le droit d\u2019acc\u00e9der \u00e0 telle page parce que quelqu\u2019un quelque part en a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 ainsi, cela me fait sortir de mes gonds. Je me suis d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu \u00e0 plusieurs reprises refuser l\u2019acc\u00e8s \u00e0 tel ou tel site parce qu\u2019on avait pens\u00e9 que ce n\u2019\u00e9tait pas p\u00e9dagogique. Eh quoi ! Rapha\u00ebl ou Waterhouse ne seraient pas p\u00e9dagogiques (si si, \u00e7a m\u2019est arriv\u00e9) ? Une recherche sur les composants vieillissants de la machine qui m\u2019est confi\u00e9e est interdite ? Que de fois je n\u2019ai pu voir tel ou tel site parce que le filtrage est mal con\u00e7u, parce qu\u2019il est inefficace ? Car il faut bien le constater : on trouve durant sa navigation sur le web ce qu\u2019il ne faudrait pas, et on y trouve pas ce qu\u2019il faudrait... Au diable les filtres donc ! J\u2019ai alors recherch\u00e9 ce qui me permettrait de naviguer sur internet sans laisser tant de traces. J\u2019ai aussi cherch\u00e9 ce qui me permettrait d\u2019utiliser internet sans avoir \u00e0 subir les limitations impos\u00e9es par un administrateur r\u00e9seau. Il faut dire qu\u2019on en parlait beaucoup au moment des r\u00e9volutions tunisiennes et \u00e9gyptiennes. En 2005, Reporters sans fronti\u00e8res avait \u00e0 ce sujet publi\u00e9 un tr\u00e8s int\u00e9ressant guide (http://www.aidh.org/ONG/rsf-guide-dissident.htm), Le Guide pratique du blogger et du cyberdissident qu\u2019il est temps de ressortir ! Quelque temps avant, Hadopi puis Lopsi soulevaient chez les internautes de nombreuses et l\u00e9gitimes questions. Donc, de mani\u00e8re g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, je veux pouvoir naviguer sur internet en toute s\u00e9curit\u00e9 et privaut\u00e9, cela de fa\u00e7on priv\u00e9e et sans limitation. Comment faire ? Voici quelques r\u00e9ponses. Mais notez bien que mon objectif n\u2019est pas de vous expliquer le fonctionnement des diff\u00e9rents logiciels que je vais \u00e9voquer, mais de vous indiquer qu\u2019ils existent, et peut-\u00eatre de vous inciter \u00e0 les utiliser.","title":"Au diable les filtres !"},{"location":"%C3%89criture/Blog/Internet%20tel%20que%20je%20l%E2%80%99utilise/#firefox","text":"Votre navigateur vous permet-il d\u2019acc\u00e9der \u00e0 internet sans avertir la terre enti\u00e8re de ce que vous faites ?

Tout ce que vous recherchez sur Google est alors chiffr\u00e9 (encrypt\u00e9 comme l\u2019on dit si mal). Ni l\u2019administrateur r\u00e9seau, ni votre fournisseur d\u2019acc\u00e8s \u00e0 internet ne pourront (a priori) savoir ce que vous faites (pour en savoir plus sur Google SSL : https://www.google.com/support/websearch/bin/answer.py?answer=173733&hl=fr).

On savait que, durant son quinquennat, Nicolas Sarkozy (puisqu\u2019il faut bien le nommer) accueillait en son gouvernement certain personnage qui, quand on lui demandait quel \u00e9tait son livre pr\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9, r\u00e9pondait beno\u00eetement Zadig et Voltaire . Plus r\u00e9cemment, voulant que l\u2019on reconnaisse les racines chr\u00e9tiennes de la France , Nicolas Sarkozy \u00e9voquait un auteur d\u00e9iste r\u00eavant d\u2019\u00e9craser l\u2019inf\u00e2me\u2026 Voil\u00e0 qui laisse perplexe ! On d\u00e9couvre aujourd\u2019hui, non sans stupeur (mais on ne s\u2019en lasse jamais), que celui qui pr\u00e9tend gouverner la France attribue un pr\u00e9nom erron\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019auteur de La Peste , de L\u2019\u00c9tranger , etc. Et, en effet, il parle de\u2026 St\u00e9phane Camus (sic) ! Des \u00e2mes bienveillantes concluront que cet homme n\u2019aime pas la litt\u00e9rature. Des esprits chagrins rappelleront qu\u2019en ce cas, il n\u2019est nul besoin de se ridiculiser en parlant de ce qu\u2019on ne conna\u00eet pas. Pour ma part, je ne peux m\u2019emp\u00eacher de trouver r\u00e9pugnante cette obstination \u00e0 vouloir que les immigr\u00e9s d\u00e9sireux d\u2019obtenir la nationalit\u00e9 fran\u00e7aise fassent preuve d\u2019une culture que les Fran\u00e7ais \u2013 y compris ceux qui se trouvent au sommet de l\u2019\u00e9tat \u2013 n\u2019ont pas. Je vous ferai gr\u00e2ce d\u2019un rappel des barbarismes, sol\u00e9cismes, massacres syntaxiques qui ont \u00e9maill\u00e9 ce quinquennat. Quoi qu\u2019il en soit, d\u2019aucuns argueront que les qualit\u00e9s de l\u2019homme sont ailleurs. Dans l\u2019\u00e9conomie par exemple. N\u2019est-ce pas l\u00e0 primordial ? Mais, pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment, c\u2019est l\u00e0 que le b\u00e2t blesse.

Je me suis souvent demand\u00e9 comment l\u2019\u00e9valuer tant il est vrai que l\u2019ancestral recours \u00e0 la dict\u00e9e est d\u00e9sastreux surtout si ladite dict\u00e9e fait l\u2019objet d\u2019une note. Pour l\u2019instant, j\u2019en suis l\u00e0 dans mes pratiques et r\u00e9flexions que je vous livre : Je ne peux plus - ou ne veux plus - proposer \u00e0 mes \u00e9l\u00e8ves une dict\u00e9e unique que le seul enseignant que je suis d\u00e9livre \u00e0 l\u2019ensemble de la classe cens\u00e9e suivre comme un seul homme. Le num\u00e9rique apportant la possibilit\u00e9 d\u2019\u00eatre un peu plus soucieux des rythmes des uns et des autres, j\u2019ai opt\u00e9 depuis plusieurs ann\u00e9es pour la dict\u00e9e que j\u2019ai enregistr\u00e9e au format mp3 et que je mets sur Ralentir travaux (exemple en 5e) . Ainsi, chaque \u00e9l\u00e8ve fait la dict\u00e9e \u00e0 son rythme et \u00e0 son niveau. S\u2019il faut une heure \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9l\u00e8ve pour pr\u00e9parer sa dict\u00e9e, il prend une heure. S\u2019il peut la faire en 10 minutes, eh bien, c\u2019est parfait ! Il peut ensuite se consacrer \u00e0 autre chose. Cette dict\u00e9e est faite par un \u00e9l\u00e8ve (sur sa tablette ou sur l\u2019ordinateur). Il travaille seul ou avec son voisin. Je ne veux voir la dict\u00e9e que lorsqu\u2019elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00fbment corrig\u00e9e par l\u2019\u00e9l\u00e8ve lui-m\u00eame. Ainsi la m\u00e9thode est la suivante : il \u00e9coute la dict\u00e9e, il l\u2019\u00e9crit puis il fait toutes sortes de v\u00e9rifications. La conjugaison des verbes est v\u00e9rifi\u00e9e dans le Bescherelle, le vocabulaire fait aussi l\u2019objet d\u2019une v\u00e9rification dans le dictionnaire (le Larousse par exemple). Certains \u00e9l\u00e8ves, notamment les plus en difficult\u00e9, trouvent un r\u00e9confort dans l\u2019utilisation d\u2019un traitement de texte, mais aussi dans un correcteur orthographique, qu\u2019il soit celui du traitement de texte ou ceux propos\u00e9s, entre autres, par Scribens ou le Bon patron. Ces derniers fournissent des explications quant aux erreurs commises. Alors seulement, je regarde et corrige le texte avec le ou les \u00e9l\u00e8ves pour les aider \u00e0 corriger tel ou tel point qu\u2019il n\u2019est parvenu \u00e0 orthographier seul. Si le besoin s\u2019en fait ressentir, une correction peut-\u00eatre faite en classe avec un vid\u00e9oprojecteur en partant d\u2019une copie (d\u2019un volontaire naturellement) permettant de traiter des fautes les plus fr\u00e9quemment faites. Une dict\u00e9e est, en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, assortie d\u2019exercices d\u2019approfondissement ou de r\u00e9vision (exemple pris en 6e) . S\u2019il appara\u00eet qu\u2019il est n\u00e9cessaire de revoir le pass\u00e9 simple , l\u2019\u00e9l\u00e8ve peut relire la le\u00e7on ou faire des exercices interactifs. Enfin, la dict\u00e9e fait l\u2019objet d\u2019une \u00e9valuation. L\u2019on voit ainsi ce qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 retenu et appris. Cumulant les dict\u00e9es, on poss\u00e8de alors un vivier de textes dans lesquels on pioche au hasard, l\u2019\u00e9l\u00e8ve devant \u00eatre capable - d\u00e9sormais - d\u2019\u00e9crire correctement n\u2019importe lequel d\u2019entre eux, ce qui n\u2019est pas rien quand on en a d\u00e9j\u00e0 fait une dizaine. Dernier point, \u00e0 l\u2019attention des contempteurs du num\u00e9rique, cette proposition de travail de l\u2019orthographe n\u2019est pas la panac\u00e9e, elle n\u2019apporte pas de solution miracle, elle n\u2019est pas non plus l\u2019unique et ultime solution. Personne n\u2019a dit \u00e7a. Simplement, il me semble que c\u2019est un moyen de faire, et que l\u2019\u00e9l\u00e8ve y trouve g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement son compte.","title":"La dict\u00e9e encore et toujours, oui mais\u2026"},{"location":"%C3%89criture/Blog/La%20faute%20%C3%A0%20ma%20s%C5%93ur/","tags":["Blog"],"text":"\ud83d\udd17 Lien Nombre d\u2019individus poussent des cris d\u2019orfraie lorsqu\u2019ils surprennent, dans les propos de leur interlocuteur, une erreur de grammaire.

Ou j\u2019\u00e9voque, quand je sens que mon entourage ne sera pas sensible \u00e0 la chansonnette populaire, le Moyen \u00c2ge, p\u00e9riode pour laquelle on utilisait beaucoup la pr\u00e9position \u00e0 l\u00e0 o\u00f9 on emploierait aujourd\u2019hui la pr\u00e9position de. Ainsi, on trouve dans Aucassin et Nicolette (je puise un exemple au pif) : Et se tu fenme vix avoir, je te donnerai la file a un roi u a un conte [...] On lit bien : \u00abla fille \u00e0 un roi ou \u00e0 un conte\u00bb et non \u00abla fille d\u2019un roi ou d\u2019un conte\u00bb. D\u2019ailleurs, comme le fait remarquer Genevi\u00e8ve Joly dans son Pr\u00e9cis d\u2019ancien fran\u00e7ais, \u00abla construction du compl\u00e9ment d\u00e9terminatif du nom \u00e0 l\u2019aide de la pr\u00e9position a n\u2019a aucune connotation famili\u00e8re en ancien fran\u00e7ais. Elle est tr\u00e8s repr\u00e9sent\u00e9e encore au XVIe si\u00e8cle, surtout en po\u00e9sie\u00bb (page 238).

C\u2019\u00e9tait d\u00e9j\u00e0 une rh\u00e9torique restreinte dont on avait retranch\u00e9 la pronuntiatio et la memoria. Elle se r\u00e9duisit comme une peau de chagrin quand elle ne devint plus qu\u2019un trait\u00e9 des figures. Au coll\u00e8ge, l\u2019enseignement rel\u00e8ve aujourd\u2019hui, pour l\u2019essentiel, d\u2019une rh\u00e9torique de l\u2019elocutio. Nous n\u2019avons, en effet, retenu de l\u2019ancienne rh\u00e9torique que quelques figures de style. Au coll\u00e8ge, l\u2019\u00e9l\u00e8ve est invit\u00e9 \u00e0 n\u2019en retenir qu\u2019un ensemble assez restreint, comme dans cet exercice (http://www.ralentirtravaux.com/lettres/exercices/troisieme/figures/figures-8.htm), par exemple. R\u00e9cemment, @mmechautard (https://twitter.com/#!/mmechautard) proposait un exercice assez int\u00e9ressant. Les \u00e9l\u00e8ves devaient, non pas simplement rep\u00e9rer quelques figures, mais r\u00e9diger quelques phrases dans lesquelles figureront une comparaison ou un zeugme, etc. Cet exercice semble avoir connu quelque succ\u00e8s, les \u00e9l\u00e8ves s\u2019\u00e9tant amus\u00e9s \u00e0 formuler des plaisanteries du type \u00abIl descendit les poubelles et son voisin\u00bb. Rh\u00e9torique et enseignement \u29eb Je me suis alors rappel\u00e9 Figures II de G\u00e9rard Genette et de \u00abRh\u00e9torique et enseignement\u00bb o\u00f9 il est expliqu\u00e9 que, auparavant, les grands textes de la litt\u00e9rature n\u2019\u00e9taient pas seulement des objets d\u2019\u00e9tude, mais aussi des mod\u00e8les \u00e0 imiter. Aujourd\u2019hui, il ne s\u2019agirait \u00e9videmment pas de demander \u00e0 un \u00e9l\u00e8ve un portrait de Byron comme cela avait pu l\u2019\u00eatre \u00e0 Flaubert. Mais, au moins, on pourrait se rappeler que la pratique r\u00e9guli\u00e8re de l\u2019\u00e9criture, dans le sillage des grands auteurs, bref ce qu\u2019on appelle l\u2019imitation, a ceci de b\u00e9n\u00e9fique qu\u2019on en revient \u00e0 une rh\u00e9torique explicite, une rh\u00e9torique qui dit son nom, au lieu d\u2019exiger de l\u2019\u00e9l\u00e8ve qu\u2019il fasse un effort pour \u00e9crire correctement . Faire un effort pour \u00e9crire correctement, cela ne veut rien dire au fond pour l\u2019\u00e9l\u00e8ve \u00e0 qui on n\u2019a jamais appris \u00e0 \u00e9crire. Tout au plus l\u2019invite-t-on \u00e0 faire attention \u00e0 l\u2019orthographe, \u00e0 suivre quelques consignes (utiliser le pass\u00e9 simple, placer des \u00e9pith\u00e8tes...). Pour le reste, il est livr\u00e9 \u00e0 lui-m\u00eame. Or la rh\u00e9torique n\u2019a jamais vraiment quitt\u00e9 le coll\u00e8ge. Elle a toujours \u00e9t\u00e9 l\u00e0, sans r\u00e9ellement faire l\u2019objet d\u2019un apprentissage avou\u00e9. En fran\u00e7ais, les pr\u00e9c\u00e9dents programmes invitaient \u00e0 r\u00e9diger une narration, d\u00e9velopper une description, \u00e0 b\u00e2tir une argumentation, etc. Dans ce dernier cas, on retrouve toutes les composantes de l\u2019ancienne rh\u00e9torique : recherche des id\u00e9es, disposition de ces id\u00e9es en un texte qui a un sens (selon la double acception : une signification et une direction), et expression de ces id\u00e9es en termes acceptables pour l\u2019institution scolaire. Encore faut-il que l\u2019\u00e9l\u00e8ve ait un peu de vocabulaire, d\u2019o\u00f9 la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 de l\u2019\u00e9tudier, de lui conf\u00e9rer une place importante, ce que font les actuels programmes de fran\u00e7ais. L\u2019\u00e9l\u00e8ve doit aussi avoir son arsenal de figures lui permettant d\u2019exprimer ses id\u00e9es avec force. \u00c0 cet effet, il importe que l\u2019\u00e9l\u00e8ve sache non seulement les rep\u00e9rer, mais aussi les utiliser d\u2019o\u00f9 les exercices susmentionn\u00e9s. Mais il est imp\u00e9ratif qu\u2019on lui ait appris \u00e0 \u00e9crire. Or on apprend \u00e0 lire, mais on n\u2019apprend pas r\u00e9ellement \u00e0 \u00e9crire. Tout au plus donne-t-on quelque exercice de r\u00e9daction dont la consigne pourrait \u00eatre : \u00abVas-y, fais de ton mieux, exprime-toi, si possible en un langage correct, avec le minimum de fautes\u00bb. Mais attend-on seulement la moindre valeur litt\u00e9raire de ce qui sera produit par l'\u00e9l\u00e8ve ? A-t-on vraiment pr\u00e9par\u00e9 cet \u00e9l\u00e8ve \u00e0 l\u2019exercice de la r\u00e9daction ? Apprendre \u00e0 \u00e9crire \u29eb Si l\u2019\u00e9l\u00e8ve a appris \u00e0 lire, il n\u2019a pas appris \u00e0 \u00e9crire d\u2019une fa\u00e7on un tant soit peu litt\u00e9raire . On reste persuad\u00e9, que l\u2019\u00e9l\u00e8ve ayant lu retiendra, ipso facto, quelques formulations que de lui-m\u00eame il restituera dans un \u00e9lan de bonne volont\u00e9. Son g\u00e9nie personnel, r\u00e9sidu romantique, fera le reste. N\u2019est-on pas l\u00e0 dans l\u2019erreur, si l\u2019on ne remet pas au go\u00fbt du jour l\u2019exercice d\u2019imitation, r\u00e9gulier, plus ou moins bref, en tout cas davantage que celui de la r\u00e9daction, et pr\u00e9parant la r\u00e9daction ? R\u00e9cemment, j\u2019ai donn\u00e9 cet exercice (http://www.ralentirtravaux.com/lettres/sequences/sixieme/sequence_9/participe-present.php) dans lequel il fallait remplacer les verbes en gras par un participe pr\u00e9sent, puis supprimer le sujet. Enfin, l\u2019\u00e9l\u00e8ve devait rajouter la conjonction de coordination \u00ab et \u00bb (voire supprimer le dernier pronom personnel sujet) : Le chat enfila ses bottes, il mit son sac \u00e0 son cou, il s\u2019en alla dans une garenne. Le chat enfila ses bottes, et mettant son sac \u00e0 son cou, s\u2019en alla dans une garenne. L\u2019objectif, dans cet exercice d\u2019imitation de Charles Perrault, \u00e9tait \u00e9videmment de manier le participe pr\u00e9sent que nous \u00e9tudiions alors, de faire un peu de grammaire donc, mais aussi de s\u2019exprimer avec davantage de fluidit\u00e9, de concision, plut\u00f4t que d\u2019accumuler des phrases courtes commen\u00e7ant r\u00e9p\u00e9titivement par le pronom personnel \u00abil\u00bb. Mais l\u2019exercice, tel quel, rel\u00e8ve essentiellement de l\u2019exercice de grammaire ou de r\u00e9\u00e9criture. Pour qu\u2019il devienne exercice d\u2019imitation, il fallait que dans la r\u00e9daction suivant l\u2019exercice, l\u2019\u00e9l\u00e8ve produise quelques phrases imitant le mod\u00e8le \u00e9tudi\u00e9. En quatri\u00e8me, cet exercice (http://www.ralentirtravaux.com/lettres/sequences/quatrieme/voyage-au-centre-de-la-terre/exercice-imitation.php) exige qu\u2019on se lance directement dans l\u2019exercice d\u2019imitation. Lisez cet extrait de Vingt mille lieues sous les mers En deux minutes, nous \u00e9tions sur la gr\u00e8ve.

Aujourd\u2019hui, il ne s\u2019agirait \u00e9videmment pas de demander \u00e0 un \u00e9l\u00e8ve un portrait de Byron comme cela avait pu l\u2019\u00eatre \u00e0 Flaubert. Mais, au moins, on pourrait se rappeler que la pratique r\u00e9guli\u00e8re de l\u2019\u00e9criture, dans le sillage des grands auteurs, bref ce qu\u2019on appelle l\u2019imitation, a ceci de b\u00e9n\u00e9fique qu\u2019on en revient \u00e0 une rh\u00e9torique explicite, une rh\u00e9torique qui dit son nom, au lieu d\u2019exiger de l\u2019\u00e9l\u00e8ve qu\u2019il fasse un effort pour \u00e9crire correctement . Faire un effort pour \u00e9crire correctement, cela ne veut rien dire au fond pour l\u2019\u00e9l\u00e8ve \u00e0 qui on n\u2019a jamais appris \u00e0 \u00e9crire. Tout au plus l\u2019invite-t-on \u00e0 faire attention \u00e0 l\u2019orthographe, \u00e0 suivre quelques consignes (utiliser le pass\u00e9 simple, placer des \u00e9pith\u00e8tes...). Pour le reste, il est livr\u00e9 \u00e0 lui-m\u00eame. Or la rh\u00e9torique n\u2019a jamais vraiment quitt\u00e9 le coll\u00e8ge. Elle a toujours \u00e9t\u00e9 l\u00e0, sans r\u00e9ellement faire l\u2019objet d\u2019un apprentissage avou\u00e9. En fran\u00e7ais, les pr\u00e9c\u00e9dents programmes invitaient \u00e0 r\u00e9diger une narration, d\u00e9velopper une description, \u00e0 b\u00e2tir une argumentation, etc. Dans ce dernier cas, on retrouve toutes les composantes de l\u2019ancienne rh\u00e9torique : recherche des id\u00e9es, disposition de ces id\u00e9es en un texte qui a un sens (selon la double acception : une signification et une direction), et expression de ces id\u00e9es en termes acceptables pour l\u2019institution scolaire. Encore faut-il que l\u2019\u00e9l\u00e8ve ait un peu de vocabulaire, d\u2019o\u00f9 la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 de l\u2019\u00e9tudier, de lui conf\u00e9rer une place importante, ce que font les actuels programmes de fran\u00e7ais. L\u2019\u00e9l\u00e8ve doit aussi avoir son arsenal de figures lui permettant d\u2019exprimer ses id\u00e9es avec force. \u00c0 cet effet, il importe que l\u2019\u00e9l\u00e8ve sache non seulement les rep\u00e9rer, mais aussi les utiliser d\u2019o\u00f9 les exercices susmentionn\u00e9s. Mais il est imp\u00e9ratif qu\u2019on lui ait appris \u00e0 \u00e9crire. Or on apprend \u00e0 lire, mais on n\u2019apprend pas r\u00e9ellement \u00e0 \u00e9crire.

R\u00e9cemment, j\u2019ai donn\u00e9 cet exercice (http://www.ralentirtravaux.com/lettres/sequences/sixieme/sequence_9/participe-present.php) dans lequel il fallait remplacer les verbes en gras par un participe pr\u00e9sent, puis supprimer le sujet.

Le chat enfila ses bottes, et mettant son sac \u00e0 son cou, s\u2019en alla dans une garenne. L\u2019objectif, dans cet exercice d\u2019imitation de Charles Perrault, \u00e9tait \u00e9videmment de manier le participe pr\u00e9sent que nous \u00e9tudiions alors, de faire un peu de grammaire donc, mais aussi de s\u2019exprimer avec davantage de fluidit\u00e9, de concision, plut\u00f4t que d\u2019accumuler des phrases courtes commen\u00e7ant r\u00e9p\u00e9titivement par le pronom personnel \u00abil\u00bb. Mais l\u2019exercice, tel quel, rel\u00e8ve essentiellement de l\u2019exercice de grammaire ou de r\u00e9\u00e9criture. Pour qu\u2019il devienne exercice d\u2019imitation, il fallait que dans la r\u00e9daction suivant l\u2019exercice, l\u2019\u00e9l\u00e8ve produise quelques phrases imitant le mod\u00e8le \u00e9tudi\u00e9.

Tout d\u2019abord, celle d\u2019un narrateur ext\u00e9rieur \u00e0 l\u2019histoire qui prend en charge l\u2019ensemble du r\u00e9cit. Celle de Simon Simonini ensuite, le protagoniste de l\u2019histoire. Celle de l\u2019abb\u00e9 Dalla Picola enfin, personnage \u00ab secondaire \u00bb, qui n\u2019est autre que le double de Simonini. L\u2019ensemble s\u2019organise selon un journal fragmentaire dont le narrateur susmentionn\u00e9 rassemble les morceaux. En effet, Simonini - ayant rencontr\u00e9 Sigmund Freud - \u00e9crit ce qui lui reste de souvenirs, esp\u00e9rant retrouver la m\u00e9moire et comprendre son histoire en retrouvant le trauma dans lequel s\u2019origine son amn\u00e9sie. Dans le m\u00eame temps, le diariste fait la d\u00e9couverte au sein m\u00eame de son appartement d\u2019un couloir menant \u00e0 un autre appartement, celui de l\u2019abb\u00e9 Dalla Picola. Selon toute vraisemblance, Simonini et Dalla Picola ne forment qu\u2019un seul et m\u00eame schizophr\u00e9nique personnage. L\u2019un ne compl\u00e9tant le journal que lorsque le second est absent ou endormi. Nous avons ainsi un \u00e9trange journal intime \u00e0 deux voix qu\u2019une troisi\u00e8me, celle du narrateur, ne jugeant pas suffisamment coh\u00e9rent ou compr\u00e9hensible, homog\u00e9n\u00e9ise pour en faire un r\u00e9cit malgr\u00e9 tout lacunaire, parcellaire, incomplet. C\u2019est lui le responsable de la vis narrandi . Un incipit labyrinthique \u29eb Cet enchev\u00eatrement de voix (que la typographie, le style et le ton permettent de distinguer ais\u00e9ment) s\u2019annonce en un d\u00e9but labyrinthique. On voit que, dans son dernier roman, Umberto Eco a abandonn\u00e9 l\u2019image du portail (que le lecteur potentiel devrait franchir) pour c\u00e9der la place \u00e0 celle du d\u00e9dale. N\u2019en sortiront que les happy few, ceux que l\u2019\u0153uvre n\u2019aura pas rebut\u00e9s. Pour d\u00e9couvrir l\u2019histoire du Cimeti\u00e8re de Prague , il faut donc suivre le narrateur dans un entrelacs de venelles qu\u2019un conditionnel pass\u00e9 r\u00e9v\u00e8le improbable : \u00ab Le passant qui en ce matin gris du mois de mars 1897 aurait travers\u00e9 \u00e0 ses risques et p\u00e9rils... \u00bb. S\u2019ensuit une travers\u00e9e des \u00ab rares endroits de Paris \u00e9pargn\u00e9s par les \u00e9ventrements du baron Haussmann \u00bb menant \u00e0 une vitrine de brocanteur, officine du faussaire Simonini. La brocante comme m\u00e9taphore litt\u00e9raire \u29eb Le bric-\u00e0-brac sans valeur qu\u2019on y trouve, c\u2019est tout le mat\u00e9riau narratif du livre, car Le Cimeti\u00e8re de Prague n\u2019est rien d\u2019autre que le recyclage de la production livresque du XIXe qu\u2019elle soit litt\u00e9raire, pamphl\u00e9taire, propagandiste, \u00e9pistolaire, etc. Le mot \u00ab recyclage \u00bb n\u2019a d\u2019ailleurs aucune connotation p\u00e9jorative. Le protagoniste - gagnant sa vie en cr\u00e9ant de faux textes brandissant des menaces jud\u00e9o-ma\u00e7onniques - ne fait pas autre chose (\u00ab N\u2019es-tu pas, toi, le ma\u00eetre du recyclage ? \u00bb, demande-t-on \u00e0 Simonini, page 427) Ce livre, qui fait ainsi le r\u00e9cit de la gen\u00e8se et du d\u00e9veloppement de l\u2019antis\u00e9mitisme, rassemble cette production h\u00e9t\u00e9roclite qu\u2019elle ait une valeur litt\u00e9raire ou non. On y trouve p\u00eale-m\u00eale les livres les moins lus des grands auteurs ( Les Myst\u00e8res du peuple d\u2019Eug\u00e8ne Sue, Joseph Balsamo d\u2019Alexandre Dumas), mais aussi ces curieux objets sinon \u00ab litt\u00e9raires \u00bb du moins historiques que sont Dialogue aux enfers entre Machiavel et Montesquieu de Maurice Joly, Les Myst\u00e8res de la Franc-Ma\u00e7onnerie de L\u00e9o taxil, Le Diable au XIXe si\u00e8cle du docteur Bataille, La France juive d\u2019\u00c9douard Drumont, etc. Simon Simonini, sycophante, faussaire, assassin et antis\u00e9mite, est ce curieux h\u00e9ros qui pour vivre fait la lecture de tout cela, et produit des textes susceptibles de servir les int\u00e9r\u00eats des services d\u2019espionnage ou de contre-espionnage agitant des menaces fantasmatiques. La menace \u29eb Umberto Eco a souvent parl\u00e9 dans ses livres des Sup\u00e9rieurs Inconnus (notamment dans Le Pendule de Foucault). Ils sont \u00e9videmment dans Le Cimeti\u00e8re de Prague . En 1789, le marquis de Luchet avertissait : \u00ab Il s\u2019est form\u00e9 au sein des plus \u00e9paisses t\u00e9n\u00e8bres, une soci\u00e9t\u00e9 d\u2019\u00eatres nouveaux qui se connoissent sans s\u2019\u00eatre vus [...] Cette soci\u00e9t\u00e9 adopte, du r\u00e9gime j\u00e9suitique, l\u2019ob\u00e9issance aveugle ; de la franche-ma\u00e7onnerie, les \u00e9preuves et les c\u00e9r\u00e9monies ext\u00e9rieures ; des Templiers, les \u00e9vocations souterraines et l\u2019incroyable audace. \u00bb ( Essai sur la secte des illumin\u00e9s , cit\u00e9 par Umberto Eco dans Six promenades dans les bois du roman et d\u2019ailleurs , page 176). Tout l\u2019enjeu du Cimeti\u00e8re de Prague est de montrer comment le XIXe si\u00e8cle a ajout\u00e9 les Juifs \u00e0 cette illusoire menace. Je ne vous ferai pas le r\u00e9cit qui montre comment l\u2019on va de Luchet \u00e0 Rachkovsky en passant par Barruel, Simonini, Joly, Goedsche, etc. En revanche, ce qu\u2019il faut comprendre, c\u2019est le m\u00e9canisme qui favorise l\u2019irruption de la fiction dans la r\u00e9alit\u00e9, celle-l\u00e0 m\u00eame qui m\u00e8ne \u00e0 Hitler ayant lu les Protocoles des Sages de Sion . Si vous n\u2019avez pas le temps de lire Le Cimeti\u00e8re de Prague , lisez les pages 174 \u00e0 185 de Six promenades dans les bois du roman et d\u2019ailleurs datant de... 1994. Vingt-six apr\u00e8s \u29eb Pourquoi Umberto Eco a-t-il attendu pr\u00e8s de 30 ans pour raconter et amplifier cette histoire afin d\u2019en faire un roman de plus de 500 pages ? Une bonne partie du mat\u00e9riau employ\u00e9 dans Le Cimeti\u00e8re de Prague ne figurait-il pas d\u00e9j\u00e0 dans Le Pendule de Foucault publi\u00e9 en 198... ? On trouvera que, chez les grands \u00e9crivains, il y a une grande et unique obsession, ici d\u00e9clin\u00e9e en plusieurs ouvrages. Apr\u00e8s tout le th\u00e8me n\u2019est-il pas fascinant ? Il suffit de nommer une chose pour qu\u2019elle existe ! Inventez un improbable complot mondial, pluris\u00e9culaire, et tout le monde d\u2019y croire ! Le faux devient vrai. L\u2019obsession flaubertienne d\u2019Eco pour l\u2019erreur, la mauvaise foi, la stupidit\u00e9 se manifeste dans toute son \u0153uvre : dans Les Limites de l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation , l\u2019auteur a \u00e9labor\u00e9 une th\u00e9orie du faux et des faussaires, dans Le Pendule de Foucault sont \u00e9voqu\u00e9s ces occultistes qui croient fanatiquement \u00e0 tout, dans Baudolino, le personnage principal est un r\u00eaveur qui affabule... Mais peut-\u00eatre y a-t-il aussi chez Eco une vertu p\u00e9dagogique ? Ne s\u2019agit-il pas - une \u00e9ni\u00e8me fois - de s\u2019interroger sur les \u00e9v\u00e9nements qui ont men\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019holocauste : \u00ab R\u00e9fl\u00e9chir sur les rapports complexes entre lecteur et histoire, entre fiction et r\u00e9alit\u00e9, constitue une forme de th\u00e9rapie contre tout endormissement de la raison, qui engendre des monstres \u00bb (op.cit., page 183).

J\u2019adore provoquer ces sons qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8dent l\u2019acquisition du langage articul\u00e9. C\u2019est exactement le contraire des \u00ab bibelots d\u2019inanit\u00e9 sonore \u00bb abolis par Mallarm\u00e9, mais il est vrai que ce sont des bibelots. On ne cesse de les r\u00e9p\u00e9ter, de se les renvoyer ou de les brandir tel un hochet, dans un claquement de langue, de dentales et de labiales. En revanche, ce n\u2019est pas du psittacisme. Chaque r\u00e9p\u00e9tition est pleine d\u2019une nuance nouvelle, pleine de l\u2019intelligence qui s\u2019\u00e9veille. C\u2019est une f\u00eate vocale. Plus tard, para\u00eet-il, l\u2019enfant int\u00e8grera un mot par heure. Cela s\u2019appelle l\u2019explosion lexicale. En tout cas, ces premiers moments de la communication verbale sont poignants.

La relation humaine ne passe donc pas que par la parole, mais elle devient ensuite essentielle, \u00e0 tel point que sans elle, on peut mourir. C\u2019est du moins ce que j\u2019avais lu un jour chez Aldo Naouri. Il racontait comment Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric de Prusse avait eu l\u2019id\u00e9e saugrenue de faire \u00e9lever des enfants dans un lieu isol\u00e9. Interdiction formelle de leur parler avait \u00e9t\u00e9 faite aux nourrices. Il s\u2019agissait de retrouver la langue originelle, celle de Dieu probablement ( je confonds peut-\u00eatre avec un livre de Paul Auster... ). Alors ? Alors, les enfants sont tous morts, tant il est vrai que l\u2019affection, la n\u00e9cessaire relation se font par la parole indispensable.","title":"Le babil"},{"location":"%C3%89criture/Blog/Le%20cahier%20de%20textes%20num%C3%A9rique/","tags":["Blog"],"text":"\ud83d\udd17 Lien J\u2019ai trouv\u00e9 la lecture du Bulletin officiel du 9 septembre 2010 sur le cahier de textes particuli\u00e8rement instructive, et je ne suis manifestement pas le seul ! Pr\u00e9cisant les modalit\u00e9s de sa mise en \u0153uvre, ce bulletin rappelle \u00e0 notre bon souvenir ce qu\u2019est un cahier de textes aujourd\u2019hui, gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 l\u2019informatique (il faut dire que le dernier bulletin datait du 3 mai 1961). Ce qui a le plus choqu\u00e9, et \u00e0 juste titre, c\u2019est que l\u2019enseignant soit enjoint \u00e0 livrer dans le futur cahier de textes num\u00e9rique \u00ab tout document, ressource ou conseil \u00e0 l'initiative du professeur, sous forme de textes, de fichiers joints ou de liens \u00bb ! Il s\u2019agit, en somme, d\u2019envoyer sur internet des fichiers dont nous n\u2019avons pas les droits. C\u2019est \u00e0 se demander comment il est possible qu\u2019une telle proposition n\u2019ait pas heurt\u00e9 le bon sens des t\u00eates pensantes du minist\u00e8re ! \u00c0 lire ce bulletin, on comprend aussi que le cahier de textes sera \u00eatre un v\u00e9ritable chef-d\u2019\u0153uvre : doivent \u00e9videmment y figurer le travail r\u00e9alis\u00e9, mais aussi le travail \u00e0 faire, le tout accompagn\u00e9 - on l\u2019a vu - de plein de fichiers ill\u00e9gaux (cf. ci-dessus). On nous demande \u00e9galement d\u2019accorder un soin tout particulier \u00e0 la mise en page : \u00ab polices de caract\u00e8res, soulignement, couleurs, etc. \u00bb (au cas o\u00f9 quelqu\u2019un aurait souhait\u00e9 faire un truc r\u00e9pugnant \u00e0 l\u2019\u0153il). En outre, \u00ab Les textes des devoirs et des contr\u00f4les figureront au cahier de textes, sous forme de textes ou de fichiers joints. Il en sera de m\u00eame du texte des exercices ou des activit\u00e9s lorsque ceux-ci ne figureront pas sur les manuels scolaires \u00bb. Les manuels scolaires... C\u2019est bien \u00e7a... Ce cahier de textes sera un v\u00e9ritable manuel scolaire ! Personnellement, \u00e7a ne me d\u00e9range pas plus que \u00e7a. \u00c9videmment, \u00e7a va r\u00e2ler dans les salles de profs ou les forums d\u2019enseignants, et je le comprends. Malheureusement, la mauvaise foi de certains d\u2019entre eux est malvenue. J\u2019ai lu la r\u00e9action d\u2019un enseignant qui disait : \u00ab et maintenant il faudrait que j'utilise mon abonnement internet et mon ordinateur pour remplir des cahiers de textes \u00bb. Ah ! Comme si on payait encore un forfait \u00e0 la connexion ! Comme si notre ordinateur allait souffrir de la nouvelle (j\u2019ai \u00e9crit \u00ab nouvelle \u00bb ?) n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 de remplir son cahier de textes ! Mais ont-ils vraiment tort ces enseignants qui rechignent ? Pas tout \u00e0 fait. Les enseignants sont \u00e9nervants \u00e0 r\u00e2ler d\u00e8s qu\u2019on leur demande quelque chose, mais je dois quand m\u00eame reconna\u00eetre ceci : on demande toujours plus \u00e0 l\u2019enseignant, sans pour autant revaloriser un salaire sans rapport avec les vicissitudes de la vie. Au reste, la derni\u00e8re fois qu\u2019un inspecteur est venu me voir, il n\u2019en avait rien \u00e0 faire de mon cahier de textes num\u00e9rique. M\u00eame pas regard\u00e9 ! Pourtant il y avait tout : la mise en page, les liens, et tutti quanti ! J\u2019ai plus ou moins abandonn\u00e9 finalement, essentiellement parce que le coll\u00e8ge a depuis investi dans un logiciel \u00e0 l\u2019interface archa\u00efque et peu ergonomique qui ne permet pas tout \u00e0 fait ce que demande le Bulletin officiel. Et, compte tenu des travaux que conna\u00eet notre \u00e9tablissement, on ne peut pas encore l\u2019utiliser (le serveur d\u00e9m\u00e9nage). \u00c0 propos d\u2019informatique, quelques mots pour finir. Je veux bien admettre la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 d\u2019\u00e9voluer dans nos pratiques. Ce qui me g\u00eane, cependant, est le peu de mat\u00e9riel figurant dans les coll\u00e8ges. Dans la salle des profs, il y a trois ordinateurs que l\u2019ex-RDA aurait m\u00e9pris\u00e9s (je le redis, juste pour le plaisir, o\u00f9 diable le Conseil g\u00e9n\u00e9ral est-il all\u00e9 chercher des \u00e9crans \u00e0 tube cathodique ?) pour une cinquantaine de profs. S\u2019il n\u2019y a pas d\u2019ordinateurs, comment fait-on ? En somme, on met la charrue avant les b\u0153ufs, mais le minist\u00e8re se dit peut-\u00eatre que les b\u0153ufs sont d\u00e9j\u00e0 l\u00e0... Il se trouve que les b\u0153ufs ont pratiquement tous un ordinateur portable. En revanche, ils n\u2019ont pas tous envie de l\u2019utiliser ou m\u00eame de l\u2019amener. Encore une fois, \u00e7a se comprend : chez nous, il n\u2019y a pas de serrure dans notre coll\u00e8ge r\u00e9nov\u00e9, mais pas fini (quelqu\u2019un a oubli\u00e9 de commander les barillets)... Alors, moi, mon ordinateur, je l\u2019ai sur moi en permanence, m\u00eame pour aller aux toilettes. Pour finir ce billet (je ne voudrais pas que l\u2019on pense que je suis r\u00e9tif au cahier de textes num\u00e9rique), je voudrais donner un modeste aper\u00e7u de ce \u00e0 quoi devrait ressembler un cahier de textes digne de ce nom : Mercredi 8 septembre S\u00e9ance 1 (fin) Le\u00e7on 1 : La chanson de geste Lecture du po\u00e8me de Victor Hugo Distribution du texte et du questionnaire de la s\u00e9ance suivante pour ceux qui veulent se mettre en avance. Pour le lundi 13 septembre, apprendre la le\u00e7on 1 Qui voudrait faire un tel travail pour le m\u00eame salaire ? Si je le fais, c'est parce que j'en ai envie, mais on ne saurait contraindre qui quoi que ce soit \u00e0 r\u00e9aliser ce travail de c\u00e9nobite. Qui a envie d\u2019utiliser les mochissimes logiciels scandaleusement vendus pour faire cela ? Ne pourrait-on trouver un logiciel \u00e9l\u00e9gant, simple, ergonomique ? Libre ? J'avoue ne pas m'\u00eatre pench\u00e9 sur la question.","title":"Le cahier de textes num\u00e9rique"},{"location":"%C3%89criture/Blog/Le%20manuel%20de%205e%20est%20publi%C3%A9/","tags":["Blog"],"text":"\ud83d\udd17 Lien Il est gratuit, il est libre \u29eb Vous dire l\u2019\u00e9motion qui s\u2019empare de moi au moment o\u00f9 j\u2019\u00e9cris ces lignes est une curieuse gageure : le manuel de 5e est disponible .

Le passage de l\u2019informatique au num\u00e9rique \u29eb Je vous ferai gr\u00e2ce d'une d\u00e9finition puis\u00e9e dans le dictionnaire. Cependant, puisque nous avons commenc\u00e9 par \u00e9voquer le projet de loi du ministre de l'\u00c9ducation nationale, je voudrais faire un peu de sp\u00e9l\u00e9ologie politique et atteindre l'ann\u00e9e 1985. L'ann\u00e9e du Plan Informatique pour tous [http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plan_informatique_pour_tous](http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plan/_informatique/_pour/_tous/)(http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plan_informatique_pour_tous%5D). Or l'informatique, tout le monde sait ce que c'est : des machines, des 0 et des 1, des langages, des logiciels, etc. Le num\u00e9rique, c'est plus compliqu\u00e9. Bien s\u00fbr, dans la d\u00e9finition que je ne vous ai pas donn\u00e9e, on trouverait aussi les 0 et les 1, mais est-ce tout ? De 1985 \u00e0 2013, on aurait juste assist\u00e9 \u00e0 une substitution lexicale ? Un simple synonyme ? Heureusement, comme personne ne se paye de mots, le passage de l'informatique au num\u00e9rique a un sens, selon la double acception du terme : une direction et une signification. En effet, depuis 1985, on sait o\u00f9 l'on va. On ne r\u00e9p\u00e9tera pas les m\u00eames erreurs. On admet qu'il ne suffit pas d'\u00e9quiper en ordinateurs des \u00e9tablissements. Sans formation des professeurs, le seul \u00e9quipement informatique ne changera pas l'enseignement. Il ne saurait s\u2019agir d\u2019enseigner le Basic ou quelque langage de programmation que ce soit. Aussi avons-nous d\u00e9laiss\u00e9 ce vain mot \u00abinformatique\u00bb au profit de \u00abnum\u00e9rique\u00bb, charg\u00e9 \u00e0 lui seul de toutes les promesses d\u2019une \u00e9cole plus appropri\u00e9e aux d\u00e9fis actuels, plus juste, plus efficace. De quelle fa\u00e7on l\u2019injonction du passage au num\u00e9rique remplira-t-elle cet objectif ? En \u00e9num\u00e9rant les possibilit\u00e9s offertes par le num\u00e9rique \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9cole, nous devrions parvenir \u00e0 d\u00e9finir ce mot employ\u00e9 partout, tout le temps. Naturellement, on n\u2019\u00e9puisera pas le sujet, mais on y verra peut-\u00eatre un peu plus clair. Potentiel num\u00e9rique \u29eb En faisant entrer le num\u00e9rique \u00e0 l'\u00e9cole, l'enseignement permettra de diff\u00e9rencier la p\u00e9dagogie (l\u2019enseignant ne peut pas se d\u00e9multiplier, mais il peut confier aux \u00e9l\u00e8ves certaines t\u00e2ches \u00e0 r\u00e9aliser sur des ordinateurs ou des tablettes). En proc\u00e9dant ainsi, il d\u00e9gage du temps pour les plus d\u00e9munis . Et par l\u00e0 m\u00eame, il contraint les \u00e9l\u00e8ves \u00e0 devenir autonomes : ils doivent effectuer certains travaux et, tant que le professeur ne s\u2019est pas pench\u00e9 sur leur travail, celui-ci doit \u00eatre effectu\u00e9 avec la pr\u00e9cision et le s\u00e9rieux requis. De surcroit, les \u00e9l\u00e8ves apprennent \u00e0 rechercher l'information , et non attendre la becqu\u00e9e professorale. Le num\u00e9rique \u00e9tant \u00e9minemment socialisant, l'\u00e9l\u00e8ve communique, partage ses connaissances, soutient l'\u00e9l\u00e8ve en difficult\u00e9. Il partage donc ses comp\u00e9tences. De la m\u00eame fa\u00e7on, l'enseignant communique avec la famille : s'\u00e9crire ou m\u00eame se parler \u00e9vacue les difficult\u00e9s, les doutes, les errements. Pour ma part, je pr\u00e9f\u00e8re que l'on m'\u00e9crive, chez moi, \u00e0 l'heure que l'on veut, plut\u00f4t que de trouver le lendemain matin un \u00e9l\u00e8ve dont le d\u00e9sarroi d\u00e9coule de son incapacit\u00e9 \u00e0 avoir fait son travail. Ainsi, on accompagne les \u00e9l\u00e8ves que personne ne peut aider \u00e0 la maison. Enfin un peu de justice dans l'enfer dominical des devoirs ! Au reste, comme mes cours sont tap\u00e9s sur mon iPad et vid\u00e9oprojet\u00e9s, il m'est tr\u00e8s facile de les envoyer par courrier. Je pourrais m\u00eame filmer le cours, et le transmettre aux absents , qui n'ont pas toujours tort et sont parfois longuement alit\u00e9s. Dans le m\u00eame ordre d'id\u00e9e, le num\u00e9rique permet d'aider les \u00e9l\u00e8ves en situation de handicap . Les tablettes permettant de changer la police, de l'augmenter, de faire lire le texte ne pouvant \u00eatre lu par l'\u00e9l\u00e8ve malvoyant, tout un public scolaire ne se laisse plus ostraciser. On voit ainsi que la classe s'ouvre sur l'ext\u00e9rieur puisque le cours est accessible, transmissible, et qu'il se poursuit hors des murs scolaires. La classe s'ouvre donc sur le monde . Les tweetclasses en sont un exemple, elles qui questionnent d'autres enseignants, d'autres \u00e9l\u00e8ves du monde entier, correspondent en temps r\u00e9el. Avec internet, l\u2019information (et non le savoir) est \u00e0 port\u00e9e de clic . L'\u00e9l\u00e8ve le porte m\u00eame dans sa poche, dans un t\u00e9l\u00e9phone cent fois plus puissant que ceux qui ont amen\u00e9 l'homme \u00e0 marcher sur la lune. Quand un \u00e9l\u00e8ve, faisant une r\u00e9daction, a besoin de telle ou telle information, je lui rappelle que cette information attend juste qu'il la recherche. Ainsi, on apprend partout : chez soi, \u00e0 l'\u00e9cole, dans le bus... Et toutes ces informations ne demandent nullement \u00e0 entrer de force dans la t\u00eate de l'\u00e9l\u00e8ve. Le gavage cognitif est frapp\u00e9 d'inanit\u00e9. Cela, par exemple, est certes tr\u00e8s beau et tr\u00e8s gratifiant de savoir des po\u00e8mes par c\u0153ur, mais cela ne sert qu'\u00e0 une chose : savoir des po\u00e8mes (et c'est tr\u00e8s important). Or ce n'est pas de \u00e7a qu'il s'agit. Il s'agit de concevoir que l\u2019information est externalis\u00e9e : des zettaoctets de savoir sur le web accessibles en deux clics. Qui a encore envie d\u2019apprendre par c\u0153ur les d\u00e9partements et leur num\u00e9ro ? Et surtout, l\u2019information est multiple : mon professeur sait, mes parents savent, Wikip\u00e9dia sait, l'internaute que je sollicite sait. Force est de reconna\u00eetre la multiplicit\u00e9 de l'autorit\u00e9 . Enfin, les tablettes, les ordinateurs favorisent la cr\u00e9ativit\u00e9 . Faites l'essai avec telle ou telle application. Demandez aux \u00e9l\u00e8ves d'en faire quelque chose. Vous serez surpris de voir \u00e0 quel point le num\u00e9rique s'\u00e9tant d\u00e9barrass\u00e9 de ses oripeaux techniques permet de faire de belles choses simplement et efficacement. Et l'enseignant ne se d\u00e9robe pas : classe invers\u00e9e [ http://www.classeinversee.com ], TED [http://laurenecastor.com/les-meilleures-conferences-ted-sur-l-education/](http://laurenecastor.com/les-meilleures-conferences-ted-sur-l-education//)(http://laurenecastor.com/les-meilleures-conferences-ted-sur-l-education/%5D) (ou Ernest [http://www.les-ernest.fr/toutes_les_videos] ou Treize minutes [ http://www.treizeminutes.fr/13minutes/all_videos.html ]), MOOC [ http://bwmarchinfo.tumblr.com/post/62901484649/les-mooc-evolution-ou-revolution ], etc. Il y a l\u00e0 une exub\u00e9rance gargantuesque, un d\u00e9sir inassouvi de faire cours. In fine, le num\u00e9rique ne permet-il pas d' acc\u00e9der \u00e0 la beaut\u00e9 artistique ? Vous qui \u00eates n\u00e9 dans les ann\u00e9es 70 ou 80, vous \u00eates-vous d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9merveill\u00e9, \u00e0 l'\u00e9cole, de la splendeur de tel tableau [ http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Pieter_Bruegel_the_Elder_-_The_Tower_of_Babel_(Vienna)_-_Google_Art_Project_-_edited.jpg ] ? De tel manuscrit enferm\u00e9 dans les coffres-forts de la BNF [http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/btv1b520004510.r=riches+heures+duc+berry.langFR](http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/btv1b520004510.r=riches+heures+duc+berry.langFR/)(http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/btv1b520004510.r=riches+heures+duc+berry.langFR%5D) ? De tel film en haute d\u00e9finition [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNGDj9IeAuI](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNGDj9IeAuI/)(http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNGDj9IeAuI%5D) ? Eh bien ! non, puisque vous n'aviez que cette photocopie ou cette t\u00e9l\u00e9 \u00e0 tube cathodique juch\u00e9e sur l'armoire du coin de la classe ! Quant aux merveilles de la BNF, vous n'y aviez simplement pas acc\u00e8s. Esquisse d\u2019un d\u00e9finition du num\u00e9rique \u29eb Il est temps de conclure. Le num\u00e9rique \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9cole n'est pas un outil, une machine ni m\u00eame un r\u00e9seau ou je ne sais quoi encore. Ou, en tout cas, pas seulement. Non, le num\u00e9rique, c'est la p\u00e9dagogie r\u00e9invent\u00e9e gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 la tekhn\u00ea . C'est accompagner les \u00e9l\u00e8ves (mais aussi les parents et tout adulte d\u00e9sireux de savoir), non plus \u00e0 pied comme le faisait l'esclave emmenant l'enfant \u00e0 l'\u00e9cole, mais librement sur les r\u00e9seaux d'ordinateurs. Ainsi, le num\u00e9rique est ce qui fait exploser le cadre spatiotemporel scolaire. L'\u00e9l\u00e8ve, mais aussi l'adulte apprend partout et tout le temps. Le num\u00e9rique fait voler en \u00e9clat l'autorit\u00e9 du ma\u00eetre. Bien s\u00fbr, celui-ci sait davantage de choses que son \u00e9l\u00e8ve, mais ni plus ni moins que les milliers d'enseignants qui diffusent leurs cours \u00e0 tout-va et de toutes les mani\u00e8res possibles. Le num\u00e9rique est d\u00e9mocratique. Personne n'est plus d\u00e9laiss\u00e9 en raison de son handicap ou de ses difficult\u00e9s. L'informatique pure s'est effac\u00e9e, on n'achoppe plus sur une difficult\u00e9 technique pour faire un beau livre, une belle photo, un film, un site web, etc. On peut alors faire de belles choses et jouir de leur beaut\u00e9. Il ne reste plus qu'\u00e0 permettre \u00e0 l'\u00e9cole de trouver le loisir (c'est le sens du mot \u00ab\u00e9cole\u00bb [http://atilf.atilf.fr/dendien/scripts/tlfiv5/visusel.exe?12;s=3158569740;r=1;nat=;sol=1;](http://atilf.atilf.fr/dendien/scripts/tlfiv5/visusel.exe?12;s=3158569740;r=1;nat=;sol=1;/)(http://atilf.atilf.fr/dendien/scripts/tlfiv5/visusel.exe?12;s=3158569740;r=1;nat=;sol=1;%5D)) d'y acc\u00e9der, \u00e0 faire comprendre aux \u00e9l\u00e8ves \u00e0 quel point toutes ces choses sont n\u00e9cessaires, d\u00e9sirables et fondamentales, que le num\u00e9rique n\u2019est pas qu\u2019un objet de divertissement, que l\u2019injonction soci\u00e9tale \u00e0 prendre son pied n\u2019est pas contradictoire avec le fait de se prendre la t\u00eate [ http://journees-elearning.com/index.php/videos-2013/215-philippe-meirieu ]. Notre \u00e9l\u00e8ve doit donc devenir un citoyen num\u00e9rique \u00e9clair\u00e9, conscient des enjeux dont personne ne peut dire o\u00f9 ils nous m\u00e8neront. Tout au plus sait-on, depuis l'affaire Snowden, que le num\u00e9rique nous expose. Si nous n\u2019y prenons garde, l\u2019homo numericus risque de se retrouver dans une nudit\u00e9 num\u00e9rique totale [http://reseaux.blog.lemonde.fr/2013/09/29/blues-net-bernard-stiegler/](http://reseaux.blog.lemonde.fr/2013/09/29/blues-net-bernard-stiegler//)(http://reseaux.blog.lemonde.fr/2013/09/29/blues-net-bernard-stiegler/%5D). Ainsi, le num\u00e9rique est un pharmakon. \u00c0 la fois rem\u00e8de et poison, il nous promet le pire et le meilleur. Dites, chers coll\u00e8gues, avez-vous connu p\u00e9riode plus exaltante ?

Cela va bient\u00f4t faire un an que j\u2019ai ce film, et je me suis enfin d\u00e9cid\u00e9 \u00e0 le regarder \u00e0 la faveur d\u2019une convalescence. Dans un autre genre, j\u2019ai vu Doctor Who que le m\u00eame ami m\u2019avait pr\u00eat\u00e9 \u00e9galement, mais je suis moins enthousiaste \u00e0 propos de cette s\u00e9rie. C\u2019est fou comme on devient cultiv\u00e9 apr\u00e8s une maladie (on lit, on \u00e9crit, on regarde). Pensez \u00e0 Roland Barthes qui avait lu tout Michelet dans un sanatorium. Malheureusement, je n\u2019ai eu qu\u2019une petite grippe. Aussi ne deviendrai-je jamais Roland Barthes (soupir). Que dire de ce film ? Que c\u2019est sinon un chef-d\u2019\u0153uvre du moins un excellent film, certes. Qu\u2019il y exprime la vision que son auteur a du chef d\u2019\u00e9tat, oui. Encore faudrait-il pr\u00e9ciser que ce film est l\u2019adaptation du roman de Georges Simenon. Que ceci, que cela ? Oui et oui. Magnifiquement tourn\u00e9 (la r\u00e9union pendant le concert est m\u00e9morable, le \u00ab suicide collectif aux accents de Wagner \u00bb !), magnifiquement film\u00e9 (pratiquement que des sc\u00e8nes d\u2019int\u00e9rieur : splendide maison de campagne pour l\u2019essentiel, assembl\u00e9e nationale, Matignon... seuls le d\u00e9but, une partie de p\u00e9tanque et une longue balade montrant la campagne de l\u2019\u00e9poque nous donnent ainsi \u00e0 voir combien la France a chang\u00e9 !), magnifiquement interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 (Jean Gabin, Bernard Blier...). On remarquera que ce film montre la France \u00e0 un tournant historique (le passage \u00e0 l\u2019Europe, qui avait commenc\u00e9 bien avant, mais si on parle aujourd\u2019hui d\u2019eurosceptiques, \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque c\u2019\u00e9taient les souverainistes qui s\u2019opposaient \u00e0 l\u2019Europe. Dire qu\u2019il y en a encore !). Enfin, il faut bien avouer que les dialogues de Jacques Audiard font merveille. Qu\u2019on ne se m\u00e9prenne pas, sans le reste pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment cit\u00e9, ces dialogues ne vaudraient pas tripette. Mais, il fallait bien Audiard pour donner vie \u00e0 ce pr\u00e9sident vieillissant (\u00c9mile Beaufort), bless\u00e9 par quarante ann\u00e9es de vie politique mais toujours int\u00e8gre dans ses id\u00e9aux, plus fougueux qu\u2019un anarchiste, rou\u00e9, matois serait plus exact, intelligent, fin, g\u00e9n\u00e9reux, \u00e9loquent, savant, dr\u00f4le enfin. Quelques exemples. Le pr\u00e9sident mange avec sa secr\u00e9taire. La jeune fille le servant lui demande si elle peut prendre son apr\u00e8s-midi. S\u2019ensuit ce dialogue : Le Pr\u00e9sident : Ah ! Pour quoi faire ? La jeune fille : Ma grand-m\u00e8re est malade.\u2028Le Pr\u00e9sident : C\u2019est bien \u00e7a... enfin... d\u2019ailleurs, c\u2019est bien de votre part de vous int\u00e9resser \u00e0 votre grand-m\u00e8re. Eh bien prenez donc votre apr\u00e8s-midi. Allez ! La jeune fille s\u2019en va. La secr\u00e9taire : Menteuse ! Coureuse ! Et vous lui passez tout ! Le Pr\u00e9sident : C\u2019est le seul \u00e9l\u00e9ment jeune de cette maison. La secr\u00e9taire : Vous ne croyez tout de m\u00eame pas \u00e0 cette histoire de grand-m\u00e8re ? Le Pr\u00e9sident : Oh ! bien s\u00fbr que non, mais elle t\u00e9moigne d\u2019une imagination d\u00e9licate. La secr\u00e9taire : D\u2019un certain culot, oui ! Le Pr\u00e9sident : Non ! Le culot aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 de me dire : \u00abMonsieur le Pr\u00e9sident, j\u2019ai besoin de mon apr\u00e8s-midi pour aller me faire sauter \u00bb! La secr\u00e9taire (air interloqu\u00e9) : ???? Le Pr\u00e9sident : Bah ! Quoi ! Le culot, le culot, c\u2019est \u00e7a ! Il faudrait enfin citer l\u2019ensemble de la s\u00e9ance de l\u2019assembl\u00e9e lors de laquelle Gabin se lance dans une intervention qui, selon Wikipedia, ferait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence aux deux cents familles . \u00c0 l\u2019assembl\u00e9e, ses propos font mouche \u00e0 chaque fois : Un d\u00e9put\u00e9 : Quand on ne veut pas du pouvoir, on le refuse M. Beaufort ! On peut tr\u00e8s bien vivre dans l\u2019ombre ! Le Pr\u00e9sident : Et ne jamais en sortir, vous en savez quelque chose ! Le Pr\u00e9sident s\u2019en prend aux patrons. De droite selon lui, et un d\u00e9put\u00e9 lui r\u00e9torque qu\u2019il y a aussi des patrons de gauche : Le Pr\u00e9sident : Il y a aussi des poissons volants, mais qui ne constituent pas la majorit\u00e9 du genre.

Wayback Machine Aujourd\u2019hui, plus que jamais, le redoublement m\u2019appara\u00eet comme \u00e9tant inique, arbitraire et inutile. La chose est devenue, selon moi, d\u00e9testable. Il n\u2019est pas jusqu\u2019au mot qui ne me soit devenu odieux : ce suffixe inutile qui indique la r\u00e9p\u00e9tition (re-) et qui fait redondance avec la suite du mot (-doublement) ! C\u2019est comme si celui qui le pronon\u00e7ait, avec une d\u00e9lectation lexicale, \u00e9non\u00e7ait deux fois la m\u00eame notion, celle d\u2019une sentence punitive qui n\u2019a rien, mais alors rien de p\u00e9dagogique. Cela fait maintenant de nombreuses ann\u00e9es que le redoublement est consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme inutile. Quel enseignant ne l\u2019a pas constat\u00e9 : tel \u00e9l\u00e8ve que l\u2019on a fait redoubler a refait une ann\u00e9e catastrophique. Le redoublement s\u2019est r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9 inutile, et chacun de le constater empiriquement. Tant et si bien qu\u2019il n\u2019y a plus besoin d\u2019argumenter, de citer les \u00e9tudes qui le disent depuis si longtemps : le redoublement est inutile ; il serait m\u00eame co\u00fbteux (1). En conseil de classe, tout le monde le sait, tout le monde le dit. Et puis, n\u2019y a-t-il pas des pays (2) o\u00f9 il n\u2019existe plus de redoublement, et cela semble fonctionner, puisque l\u2019on nous dit (je ne sais plus o\u00f9) qu\u2019un \u00e9l\u00e8ve, \u00e0 niveau \u00e9gal, progresse plus vite en passant dans la classe sup\u00e9rieure qu\u2019un \u00e9l\u00e8ve redoublant. Par ailleurs, le redoublement aurait un effet d\u00e9vastateur, traumatisant (3). \u00c9videmment, ce n\u2019est pas ce dernier argument qui l\u2019emporte. En dehors de toute l\u00e9gislation sur le sujet, on continue \u00e0 faire redoubler, dans les limites \u00e9troites du non-dit administratif (rectorat, inspection acad\u00e9mique), c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire que m\u00eame si une bande de r\u00e9actionnaires nostalgiques d\u00e9cide que K\u00e9vin (si si, on trouve parfois et m\u00eame souvent un accent) va redoubler, il va redoubler, sauf si le chef d\u2019\u00e9tablissement d\u00e9cide dans le secret de son bureau, et en accord avec les injonctions administratives, qu\u2019il ne doit pas encombrer la classe de niveau inf\u00e9rieur. On redouble donc peu dor\u00e9navant. En revanche, on redouble toujours. Qui est la cible de tant d\u2019attention ? La bande de gros nuls qui, en six ou sept ans, ne parvient toujours pas \u00e0 aligner deux mots sans faire quatre fautes d\u2019orthographe ? Que nenni ! Celui qui va redoubler, c\u2019est le pauvre gosse \u00e0 qui l\u2019on fait croire que c\u2019est une chance, qu\u2019il va pouvoir s\u2019am\u00e9liorer. Il a parfois une moyenne sup\u00e9rieure \u00e0 la bande tout enti\u00e8re r\u00e9unie ! Ce discours sur le redoublement s\u2019accompagne d\u2019une affirmation tacite : les autres gros nuls, ils sont trop nuls pour b\u00e9n\u00e9ficier d\u2019une telle \u00ab chance \u00bb, ils rejoindront la sortie plus vite ! Personne ne semble s\u2019apercevoir que le \u00ab chanceux \u00bb va devoir, \u00e0 la rentr\u00e9e, se d\u00e9brouiller\u2026 tout seul. C\u2019est un peu comme si on vous faisait traverser un labyrinthe dans lequel vous vous perdez naturellement. Au bout d\u2019une ann\u00e9e, les murs tombent, vous croyez trouver la sortie. On vous dit : \u00ab On recommence \u00bb ! Et naturellement, vous ne parvenez pas plus \u00e0 trouver la sortie que la premi\u00e8re fois. Pire encore : comme K\u00e9vin ne comprend pas, malgr\u00e9 force explications, pourquoi sa bande de copains est tout de m\u00eame pass\u00e9e (apr\u00e8s tout ne sont-ils pas aussi nuls voire plus nuls que lui ? Il y a m\u00eame un qui a trait\u00e9 tel professeur de \u00ab gros b\u00e2tard \u00bb), il se dit que c\u2019est louche, qu\u2019on ne lui donne pas une seconde chance, mais qu\u2019on le punit et qu\u2019on n\u2019en punit pas certains. Et quand bien m\u00eame la sentence aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 prononc\u00e9e avec toutes les meilleures intentions du monde, le message est tellement brouill\u00e9 qu\u2019il est incompr\u00e9hensible pour l\u2019\u00e9l\u00e8ve. Le redoublement est donc inutile, inique, arbitraire. C\u2019est, on l\u2019a vu, de surcro\u00eet co\u00fbteux, peut-\u00eatre m\u00eame sadique, certainement et inconsciemment punitif.

Je fais part de cet article \u00e0 mes coll\u00e8gues, dont l\u2019une me parle aussit\u00f4t du petit livre de Tzvetan Todorov paru en 2006 La litt\u00e9rature en p\u00e9ril, dans lequel sont expliqu\u00e9s les liens qui unissent structuralisme et communisme. Au d\u00e9but de son livre, Todorov explique que les \u00e9tudes litt\u00e9raires \u00e9taient \u00ab sous l\u2019emprise de l\u2019id\u00e9ologie officielle \u00bb, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire celle de la Bulgarie faisant alors partie du bloc communiste en 1956.

La solution \u00e9tait simple. Comme l\u2019avaient fait dans les ann\u00e9es 20 les formalistes russes, il s\u2019agissait de ne s\u2019int\u00e9resser qu\u2019\u00e0 \u00ab la mat\u00e9rialit\u00e9 m\u00eame du texte, \u00e0 ses formes linguistique \u00bb, \u00ab \u00e0 s\u2019occuper d\u2019objets sans teneur id\u00e9ologique \u00bb. Ainsi les observations litt\u00e9raires \u00e9chappaient \u00e0 la censure. On voit ainsi comment le structuralisme, le formalisme ou toute mani\u00e8re de ne s\u2019int\u00e9resser qu\u2019\u00e0 la forme pure \u00e9taient au d\u00e9part un moyen d\u2019\u00e9chapper \u00e0 l\u2019emprise du parti. Plus tard, elle sera un r\u00e9\u00e9quilibrage, une approche conciliant \u00e9tude du contexte historique, id\u00e9ologique, esth\u00e9tique (soit la tendance dominante de la critique \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque) et \u00e9tude de la relation des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de l\u2019\u0153uvre entre eux (la tendance de la nouvelle critique, celle de Barthes, Genette, Todorov...) Je ne suis pas s\u00fbr que cela explique la critique de Derrida, que je ne suis pas s\u00fbr d\u2019avoir comprise, mais la suite du livre de Todorov est int\u00e9ressante. Ce dernier pense que l\u2019enseignement ( que ce soit dans le secondaire, \u00e0 l\u2019universit\u00e9... ) est le reflet d\u2019une conception \u00e9troite de la litt\u00e9rature qui consid\u00e8re l\u2019\u0153uvre litt\u00e9raire comme un objet auto-suffisant, sans rapport avec le monde, fait de jeux formels dont les r\u00e8gles internes pr\u00e9valent. En classe, on \u00e9tudie des situations d\u2019\u00e9nonciation, des genres, des registres, des figures de style, des points de vue, les fonctions de Greimas, les fonctions du langage de Jakobson, bref des concepts forg\u00e9s par l\u2019analyse litt\u00e9raire mais pas les \u0153uvres. Le pire est que cela conduit \u00e0 un d\u00e9sint\u00e9r\u00eat pour la litt\u00e9rature, ce que la d\u00e9saffection pour les fili\u00e8res litt\u00e9raires semble confirmer. On confond donc le but et le moyen, les outils avec l\u2019objet : \u00ab \u00c0 l\u2019\u00e9cole, on n\u2019apprend pas de quoi parle les \u0153uvres mais de quoi parlent les critiques \u00bb (page 19) ; \u00ab [...] les \u00e9tudes litt\u00e9raires ont pour but premier de nous faire conna\u00eetre les outils dont elles se servent \u00bb (page 18). Mais, la majeure partie du livre de Todorov n\u2019est pas constitu\u00e9e de ce constat qui tiendrait en une dizaine de pages. Il ne crie pas non plus haro sur le structuralisme ( comment le pourrait-il ? ) qui pourrait facilement \u00eatre d\u00e9sign\u00e9 comme le coupable des d\u00e9rives susmentionn\u00e9es. Il montre comment on en est arriv\u00e9 \u00e0 cette situation. Et alors qu\u2019on pouvait penser que le structuralisme endosserait le r\u00f4le du coupable id\u00e9al, Todorov montre comment la naissance de l\u2019esth\u00e9tique moderne \u00e0 contribu\u00e9 \u00e0 fa\u00e7onner la notion de Beau, d\u2019Art, et donc d\u2019\u0153uvre auto-suffisante, coup\u00e9 du monde. De Platon \u00e0 la th\u00e9orie de l\u2019art pour l\u2019art, il explique comment l\u2019enseignement et la critique en sont venus \u00e0 privil\u00e9gier l\u2019\u0153uvre et ses jeux formels comme un objet clos et non comme \u00ab un discours sur le monde \u00bb (page 31), ce qu\u2019elle est avant tout. Je ne peux r\u00e9sumer toutes ces pages ( 37 \u00e0 68 ), mais elles valent d\u2019\u00eatre lues, et on ne pourra ainsi pas accuser le structuralisme de tous les maux. Enfin Todorov montre pourquoi la litt\u00e9rature est en p\u00e9ril. Selon lui, elle est prise dans un \u00ab corset \u00e9touffant \u00bb, \u00ab fait de jeux formel, complaintes nihilistes et nombrilisme solipsiste \u00bb (page 85). Pourtant, le structuralisme a beaucoup apport\u00e9. Il faut se souvenir de ce qu\u2019\u00e9tait la critique litt\u00e9raire auparavant. Pensez \u00e0 la philologie. Relisez Contre Sainte-Beuve. Mais Todorov pr\u00e9vient en s\u2019opposant \u00e0 tout manich\u00e9isme : \u00ab on n\u2019est pas oblig\u00e9 de choisir entre le retour \u00e0 la vieille \u00e9cole du village, o\u00f9 tous les enfants portent la blouse grise, et le modernisme \u00e0 tous crins ; on peut garder les beaux projets du pass\u00e9 sans avoir \u00e0 conspuer tout ce qui trouve sa source dans le monde contemporain \u00bb ( page 24 ). Au reste, le structuralisme a-t-il \u00e9t\u00e9 autre chose qu\u2019une tentative de d\u00e9chiffrer le monde, de lui donner du sens ? Ne serait-il pas paradoxal que l\u2019on fasse le proc\u00e8s de ce qui n\u2019a jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 autre chose qu\u2019\u00ab un discours sur le monde \u00bb ? Cherchant \u00e0 d\u00e9finir l\u2019homme structural, Roland Barthes le d\u00e9signait ainsi, Homo significans, percevant \u00ab le frisson d\u2019une machine immense qui est l\u2019humanit\u00e9 en train de proc\u00e9der inlassablement \u00e0 une cr\u00e9ation du sens \u00bb (L\u2019activit\u00e9 structuraliste in Essais critiques, pp. 218-219). Et parlant de la litt\u00e9rature, Barthes \u00e9crivait \u00ab qu\u2019elle est \u00e0 la fois intelligible et interrogeante, parlante et silencieuse, engag\u00e9e dans le monde par le chemin du sens qu\u2019elle refait avec lui, mais d\u00e9gag\u00e9e des sens contingents que le monde \u00e9labore \u00bb ( c\u2019est moi qui souligne ).","title":"Le structuralisme coupable ?"},{"location":"%C3%89criture/Blog/Les%20chanteuses/","text":"\ud83d\udd17 Lien R\u00e9cemment, j\u2019ai d\u00e9couvert Fred Viola qui chante merveilleusement bien, mais je m\u2019aper\u00e7ois que je suis de plus en plus sensible \u00e0 la voix f\u00e9minine.

Qu\u2019est-ce que le m\u00e9rite ? \u29eb Commen\u00e7ons par d\u00e9finir le m\u00e9rite. On jugera du m\u00e9rite d\u2019une personne en fonction du caract\u00e8re particulier qu\u2019elle aura de r\u00e9aliser son travail, car personne ne s\u2019int\u00e9resse au travail et \u00e0 la fa\u00e7on dont il est r\u00e9alis\u00e9 quotidiennement. Hormis l\u2019inspecteur, je n\u2019ai encore jamais vu qui que ce soit venir me serrer la main et me dire : \u00ab Bravo, vous avez vraiment bien fait votre travail.

En somme, personne ne vient vous remercier ou vous r\u00e9compenser d\u2019avoir fait votre travail. Vous avez, pour cela, un salaire, il est vrai excessivement et ridiculement bas, mais un salaire tout de m\u00eame. Revenons \u00e0 la question du m\u00e9rite. Il me semble que beaucoup d\u2019enseignants font leur travail, je veux dire simplement. Certes, ils ne montent pas particuli\u00e8rement de projets appr\u00e9ci\u00e9s de la direction parce que valorisants pour l\u2019image de l\u2019\u00e9tablissement, ils ne se font pas particuli\u00e8rement remarquer en pr\u00e9parant des sorties ou ne se distinguent pas par l\u2019usage des TICE, mais ils font leur travail. Ce sont des vacataires, des certifi\u00e9s, des agr\u00e9g\u00e9s ou des PEGC\u2026 Ils font encore des d\u00e9coupages, et des photocopies pourries, mais ils font tr\u00e8s bien leur travail. Les \u00e9l\u00e8ves les appr\u00e9cient, ils progressent, sont enjou\u00e9s ou ternes, donnent de leur temps, ne vont pas uriner de la matin\u00e9e pour apporter de l\u2019aide \u00e0 un \u00e9l\u00e8ve pendant la r\u00e9cr\u00e9ation, mais vous savez quoi ? Cela n\u2019int\u00e9resse personne, car la prime ne r\u00e9compensera pas ce que vous avez toujours fait, mais votre capacit\u00e9 \u00e0 faire ce que le gouvernement veut que vous fassiez. Exemple type : un pr\u00e9fet doit organiser des expulsions. Plus il expulse de clandestins, plus il est m\u00e9ritant. M\u00eame chose pour les recteurs : celui-ci doit supprimer des postes. Plus il trouve de postes \u00e0 supprimer, plus il est m\u00e9ritant. Il obtient une prime, car il est efficace. Et c\u2019est bien le mot qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9voqu\u00e9 \u00e0 propos de la r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration par les primes des directeurs d\u2019\u00e9tablissements. Il faut \u00eatre efficace. L\u2019enseignant efficace \u29eb Heureusement, il n\u2019est venu \u00e0 l\u2019esprit de personne \u2013 mais une b\u00eatise est si vite arriv\u00e9e (on a en a un exemple avec Hadopi) \u2013 d\u2019attendre qu\u2019un enseignant soit efficace. Que l\u2019on s\u2019en convainque : un enseignant ne peut pas \u00eatre efficace. Si un \u00e9l\u00e8ve ne travaille pas, je peux le punir, lui mettre une mauvaise note, convoquer ses parents, mais je ne peux pas le forcer \u00e0 travailler. Je ne peux pas aller contre sa volont\u00e9 ou l\u2019absence de volont\u00e9 de ses parents. Je peux le torturer \u00e9videmment, mais cette m\u00e9thode n\u2019est pas reconnue par l\u2019\u00e9tat. C\u2019est dommage. On ne dirait plus des interrogations que l\u2019on contr\u00f4le, mais que l\u2019on soumet \u00e0 la question\u2026 L\u00e0, je serai efficace. Sans torture, en revanche, on peut tricher, un peu comme on le fait avec le brevet des coll\u00e8ges : tout le monde a gagn\u00e9, tout le monde a r\u00e9ussi. Les \u00e9l\u00e8ves ont tous 20/20. Donnez-moi une belle prime. Mais on l\u2019aura compris, ce n\u2019est pas de ce c\u00f4t\u00e9 qu\u2019il faut chercher le m\u00e9rite de l\u2019enseignant. Et puis, j\u2019aime \u00e0 penser que ce que je dis, que ce je fais faire \u00e0 un \u00e9l\u00e8ve germe dans son esprit d\u2019\u00e9l\u00e8ve lentement, selon le degr\u00e9 de maturit\u00e9, selon les vicissitudes et parfois des ann\u00e9es apr\u00e8s. En somme, l\u2019\u00e9ducation n\u2019est pas ou ne devrait pas \u00eatre soumise \u00e0 la pression du temps, ni de la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9, malgr\u00e9 qu\u2019on en ait, et encore moins de l\u2019efficacit\u00e9. On ne peut pas \u00eatre efficace avec un \u00e9l\u00e8ve, ce n\u2019est pas un mat\u00e9riau. Quand je fais de la ma\u00e7onnerie, je peux \u00eatre efficace (jusqu\u2019\u00e0 un certain point, il est vrai). Je peux me fixer des objectifs et les r\u00e9aliser en un temps donn\u00e9. Mais, ce que je peux faire avec des briques et du ciment, je ne peux pas le faire avec un enfant. Il n\u2019est pas ma cr\u00e9ature soumise \u00e0 mon bon vouloir, lequel serait pernicieusement celui de ma hi\u00e9rarchie. Ainsi le m\u00e9rite ne serait pas subordonn\u00e9 aux r\u00e9sultats obtenus par les \u00e9l\u00e8ves. Accomplir les volont\u00e9s minist\u00e9rielles \u29eb Au bout du compte, le m\u00e9rite consiste \u00e0 appliquer les volont\u00e9s minist\u00e9rielles. On veut voir l\u2019enseignant accomplir \u00e0 la lettre le Bulletin officiel, quitte \u00e0 nier sa libert\u00e9 p\u00e9dagogique, sa capacit\u00e9 \u00e0 adapter son savoir-faire, ses d\u00e9sirs, sa connaissance de la r\u00e9alit\u00e9 que seul lui conna\u00eet et qui ne s\u2019accommode pas toujours des d\u00e9sirs minist\u00e9riels. Et qui sera charg\u00e9 de v\u00e9rifier que l\u2019enseignant est efficace ? Pas l\u2019inspecteur, qui vient quand il le peut. Non, ce sera le chef d\u2019\u00e9tablissement ou le proviseur. Ce myst\u00e9rieux individu que l\u2019on voudrait voir \u0153uvrer comme un manager d\u2019entreprise au nom d\u2019une autonomie galvaud\u00e9e. L\u2019enseignant sera d\u00e9pendant d\u2019un personnage dont le r\u00f4le reste \u00e0 d\u00e9finir. Autant dire qu\u2019on ne sait pas \u00e0 quelle sauce on sera mang\u00e9. La seule chose que je sais, c\u2019est que si ma carri\u00e8re d\u00e9pend du chef d\u2019\u00e9tablissement, je suis l\u00e9gitimement en droit de m\u2019inqui\u00e9ter, car peu de ceux que j\u2019ai rencontr\u00e9s ont suscit\u00e9 en moi un r\u00e9el sentiment d\u2019admiration\u2026 L\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9 ou la foire d\u2019empoigne \u29eb Et puis imaginez un peu la chose : des enseignants pay\u00e9s au m\u00e9rite, se faisant valoir \u00e0 qui mieux mieux pour \u00eatre bien vu de celui qui va vous \u00e9valuer ! C\u2019est l\u2019horreur assur\u00e9e, un peu comme comme la d\u00e9j\u00e0 existante foire \u00e0 l\u2019empoigne qu\u2019est l\u2019obtention des HSE. Certains travaillent, et c\u2019est tout. D\u2019autres travaillent, et veulent absolument que cela se sache, et soit l\u2019objet d\u2019une r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration suppl\u00e9mentaire. La r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration par le m\u00e9rite ne ferait alors qu\u2019accro\u00eetre cette rivalit\u00e9 financi\u00e8re entre enseignants. Une salle des profs, ce n\u2019est d\u00e9j\u00e0 pas folichon, mais alors l\u00e0\u2026 Encore qu\u2019en mati\u00e8re d\u2019in\u00e9galit\u00e9, on pourrait \u00e9voquer la r\u00e9cente augmentation de certains et pas d\u2019autres ! Je vous \u00e9pargnerai la conclusion r\u00e9capitulant les arguments susmentionn\u00e9s.

Quand on le lit, on est certain de trouver quelques mots comme - si ma m\u00e9moire ne me fait pas d\u00e9faut - am\u00e9nit\u00e9 , alacrit\u00e9 , acrimonie ou encore atermoyer ou gabegie . Il faudrait \u00e9tablir une de ces listes ch\u00e8res \u00e0 Umberto Eco, car on en trouverait beaucoup d\u2019autres. Force est de constater que le p\u00e8re de Nicolas Le Floch a une pr\u00e9dilection pour le mot homicider dont tout le monde conna\u00eet le sens, \u00e0 ceci pr\u00e8s que Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Parot a ressuscit\u00e9 son emploi pronominal, s\u2019homicider qui \u00e9quivaut \u00e0 se suicider , occurrence moderne moins accessible de prime abord, le pronom sui (soi) paraissant plus savant que le nom homo , hominis . On retrouve s\u2019homicider dans pratiquement chacun de ses livres (je n\u2019ai pas pu tout v\u00e9rifier, ayant pr\u00eat\u00e9 certains d\u2019entre eux) : \u00ab Vous \u00eates convaincu comme moi-m\u00eame que ce jeune homme s\u2019est homicid\u00e9, n\u2019est-ce pas ? \u00bb ( L\u2019Homme au ventre de plomb , chapitre I, page 36, \u00e9dition 10/18) \u00ab Tout laisse \u00e0 croire qu\u2019ayant tu\u00e9 la fille il a tent\u00e9 de se punir en s\u2019homicidant. \u00bb, ( Le Crime de l\u2019h\u00f4tel Saint-Florentin , chapitre II, p. 53, \u00e9dition JC Latt\u00e8s) \u00ab Il y a possibilit\u00e9 qu\u2019il ait voulu s\u2019homicider [...] \u00bb ( Le Cadavre anglais , chapitre III, p.91, \u00e9dition JC Latt\u00e8s) \u00ab Pouah ! Songeriez-vous \u00e0 vous homicider ? \u00bb ( Le Noy\u00e9 du Grand Canal , chapitre II, p.47, \u00e9dition JC Latt\u00e8s) La fr\u00e9quence de ce mot dans les romans de Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Parot tient peut-\u00eatre \u00e0 des questions d\u2019ordre g\u00e9n\u00e9rique. Dans un roman policier, il n\u2019est probablement pas surprenant qu\u2019il y ait des morts, fussent-ils homicid\u00e9s . Pourtant, cette r\u00e9currence - notamment dans les premiers chapitres et ce de fa\u00e7on quasi syst\u00e9matique - m\u2019appara\u00eet davantage comme une ficelle romanesque, une volont\u00e9 d\u2019en imposer par un effet de r\u00e9el cr\u00e9\u00e9 par l\u2019emploi d\u2019un vocabulaire du XVIIIe si\u00e8cle particuli\u00e8rement savoureux. Au reste, il n\u2019est pas impossible que l\u2019auteur affectionne particuli\u00e8rement ce mot et l\u2019emploie \u00e0 l\u2019envi. Toutes ces hypoth\u00e8ses ne sont pas exclusives. Je suis d\u2019ailleurs convaincu que Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Parot aime le XVIIIe si\u00e8cle dans ses b\u00e2timents, ses hommes, ses histoires jusque dans ses mots (on rougit de dire tant d\u2019\u00e9vidences...). Il n\u2019est donc pas rare de lire sous la plume de cet auteur ses mots f\u00e9tiches revenant r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement, pour mon plus grand plaisir, parce que s\u2019il ne les r\u00e9p\u00e9tait pas, je les oublierais comme le d\u00e9licieux pet-en-l\u2019air d\u00e9signant une robe de chambre ( L\u2019Affaire Nicolas Le Floch , p. 157 et Le Noy\u00e9 du Grand Canal , p. 103 \u00e9dition JC Latt\u00e8s).","title":"Les mots pr\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9s de Jean Fran\u00e7ois Parot"},{"location":"%C3%89criture/Blog/Lettre%20ouverte%20%C3%A0%20un%20lyc%C3%A9en%20%28qui%20n%E2%80%99a%20pas%20la%20maturit%C3%A9%20pour%20%C3%AAtre%20%C3%A9duqu%C3%A9%20au%20num%C3%A9rique%29/","tags":["Blog"],"text":"\ud83d\udd17 Lien Cher lyc\u00e9en, toi qui a - ou qui es en passe d\u2019avoir - l\u2019\u00e2ge de te marier, de voter et m\u00eame de faire la guerre, tu n\u2019aurais pas la maturit\u00e9 n\u00e9cessaire pour \u00eatre \u00e9duqu\u00e9 au num\u00e9rique.

Et dans ce dernier cas, parle-t-on de cam\u00e9ra, d\u2019appareil photo, de t\u00e9l\u00e9viseur num\u00e9riques ? Et, au fait, la fracture num\u00e9rique n\u2019existe-t-elle plus ? Tous les adolescents sont-ils devenus \u00e9gaux face au num\u00e9rique ? Ont-ils tous les m\u00eames capacit\u00e9s ? Le m\u00eame \u00e9quipement ? La m\u00eame connexion internet ? Bref, la chose est si vague, si fausse, si r\u00e9voltante qu\u2019elle devrait susciter l\u2019indignation. Mais non, les gens ont pr\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9 applaudir \u00e0 tout rompre. Le lyc\u00e9en - lui qui vit et jongle en permanence avec divers appareils - ne m\u00e9rite pas que l\u2019on se d\u00e9sint\u00e9resse \u00e0 ce point de son pr\u00e9sent. On ne peut non plus n\u00e9gliger son avenir dans lequel les machines seront chaque jour davantage omnipr\u00e9sentes. Demain, le lyc\u00e9en votera sur son t\u00e9l\u00e9phone, il paiera ses courses avec ce m\u00eame appareil. Il rencontrera peut-\u00eatre m\u00eame sa femme par ce truchement. Sa culture - f\u00fbt-elle litt\u00e9raire - est num\u00e9rique. Lui dire que l\u2019enseignement se d\u00e9sint\u00e9resse de cette question, c\u2019est lui dire : \u00abTon univers ne m\u2019int\u00e9resse pas. Le tien et le mien (celui de la litt\u00e9rature, celui de la po\u00e9sie et du baroque) ne s\u2019interp\u00e9n\u00e9treront jamais\u00bb. Le professeur de lettres que je suis trouve ce discours absolument inaudible. Le professeur que je suis voudrait te dire tout ce que je souhaiterais que tu apprennes si j\u2019avais la charge de ton \u00e9ducation num\u00e9rique. Tout d\u2019abord, tu apprendrais \u00e0 te servir d\u2019un clavier. Tu apprendrais donc la dactylographie afin de frapper m\u00e9lodieusement et d\u00e9licatement de tes dix doigts ce clavier que tu utilises tous les jours. Et pas comme ces autodidactes heurtant nerveusement et f\u00e9brilement les touches lorsqu\u2019ils chattent sur les messageries instantan\u00e9es. Les raccourcis clavier, les combinaisons de touches n\u2019auraient aucun secret pour toi. Ta frappe aurait l\u2019efficacit\u00e9 d\u2019un d\u00e9veloppeur programmant en C++. Tu apprendrais \u00e9galement la typographie, afin que les documents que tu imprimes n\u2019aient pas la laideur repoussante de ceux que les adultes nous imposent. Tu d\u00e9couvrirais diff\u00e9rentes \u00abfontes\u00bb et saurais ce qu\u2019est une espace ins\u00e9cable ou le quart de cadratin. Soucieux de ton orthographe, tu d\u00e9couvrirais l\u2019importance et la richesse des correcteurs orthographiques que sont Antidote ou le Petit ProLexis. Tu apprendrais \u00e0 te servir d\u2019une machine, \u00e0 la d\u00e9monter et \u00e0 la remonter, tu consid\u00e9rerais chaque syst\u00e8me d\u2019exploitation, chaque programme \u00e0 sa juste valeur, et ta pratique ne serait pas assujettie \u00e0 celle qui t\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 impos\u00e9e par l\u2019usage, celui du cercle familial, de l\u2019impact publicitaire ou m\u00eame du co\u00fbt financier. La programmation serait enseign\u00e9e. L\u2019omnipr\u00e9sence du web ne plaide-t-elle pas en faveur du HTML 5, du CSS 3, du JavaScript, etc. ? Eh quoi ? Un internaute ne serait-il qu\u2019un simple usager, jamais un cr\u00e9ateur ? Le web 2.0 n\u2019\u00e9tait-il qu\u2019un mythe ? Faut-il enfermer les lyc\u00e9ens dans la simple utilisation de programme d\u00e9livrant des sites tout faits ? D\u00e9sire-t-on un web uniforme ? En outre, l\u2019apprentissage de la programmation invite \u00e0 la plus grande des rigueurs : si le programme est mal \u00e9crit, il ne fonctionne pas. L\u2019usage du web doit-il se conformer \u00e0 des lois sinon iniques du moins inadapt\u00e9es ? Un lyc\u00e9en devrait pouvoir outrepasser les filtres qui lui sont impos\u00e9s. Il doit pouvoir assurer la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 de son r\u00e9seau wifi. Il doit pouvoir d\u00e9plomber ce qu\u2019il a l\u00e9galement achet\u00e9 pour pouvoir en jouir \u00e0 sa guise. Il doit pouvoir regarder ses s\u00e9ries am\u00e9ricaines sans que l\u2019industrie t\u00e9l\u00e9visuelle ne lui indique quand, comment et de quelle fa\u00e7on il doit les regarder. De ce point de vue, le lyc\u00e9en doit \u00eatre un hacker, et un hacker qui parle anglais. Il est m\u00eame polyglotte, parce que connect\u00e9 aux r\u00e9seaux sociaux, il s\u2019adresse \u00e0 la plan\u00e8te enti\u00e8re. Il parle \u00e0 ceux qui se trouvent dans leur printemps r\u00e9volutionnaire, il parle aux lyc\u00e9ens des antipodes subissant des cataclysmes, il suit sur son t\u00e9l\u00e9phone l\u2019arrestation de Ben Laden avant tout le monde. Enfin, on peut esp\u00e9rer que ce lyc\u00e9en, tel un de ces \u00e9tudiants fac\u00e9tieux qui hantent les romans ou l\u2019histoire de l\u2019informatique, soit l\u2019un de ces farceurs qui font enrager les grandes entreprises. Un Steve Wozniak en puissance m\u00e2tin\u00e9 de Panurge. La culture qui est la sienne est aussi une culture soucieuse de la garantie des libert\u00e9s informatiques. Le lyc\u00e9en est soucieux de sa vie priv\u00e9e (il sait par exemple ce qu\u2019est un VPN), il est d\u00e9sireux d\u2019utiliser les standards de l\u2019informatique, et recherche autant que faire se peut les logiciels libres. Il ne veut pas mettre son avenir (et tous ses pr\u00e9cieux documents) entre les mains de g\u00e9ants informatiques mercantiles. Retourn\u00e9 dans la galaxie Gutemberg, il est sorti d\u2019un univers que l\u2019on croyait un temps uniquement d\u00e9volu au monde de l\u2019image. Le lyc\u00e9en passe son temps \u00e0 lire... sur internet. Il faut donc lui apprendre \u00e0 le faire, \u00e0 choisir soigneusement ses sources pour \u00e9viter de se faire berner par le moindre pervers malicieux. Il doit croire en la libert\u00e9 de la presse, et la parcourir quotidiennement. Il doit lire autant de livres qu\u2019il veut sur son iPad, sa tablette Andro\u00efd, sur ce qu\u2019il veut enfin, mais lire. Et prendre des notes avec l\u2019un de ces merveilleux programmes qu\u2019est, par exemple, Evernote. Quand il part en vacances, il a dans sa poche ou dans son sac des milliers de livres. Il peut m\u00eame, s\u2019il le d\u00e9sire et si on l\u2019a aid\u00e9 \u00e0 en comprendre l\u2019importance, avoir le Grand Robert. Avec cela, il ne reviendra jamais au papier, ce support jauni, terne, en petits caract\u00e8res noir et blanc. Et quand il achoppe sur une notion, quelle qu\u2019elle soit, il doit pouvoir trouver de l\u2019aide dans cette grande biblioth\u00e8que qu\u2019est internet soit en cherchant, soit en s\u2019adressant \u00e0 ses enseignants bienveillants par le biais de la visioconf\u00e9rence.","title":"Lettre ouverte \u00e0 un lyc\u00e9en (qui n\u2019a pas la maturit\u00e9 pour \u00eatre \u00e9duqu\u00e9 au num\u00e9rique)"},{"location":"%C3%89criture/Blog/Lire%20ou%20ne%20pas%20lire%20Guy%20M%C3%B4quet%20%3F/","tags":["Blog"],"text":"\ud83d\udd17 Lien ![[lettre_guy_moquet.jpg]] Il est demand\u00e9 aux enseignants des lyc\u00e9es de lire la lettre de Guy M\u00f4quet.

En tant que fonctionnaire, l\u2019enseignant voudra bien s\u2019abstenir de fournir la moindre r\u00e9flexion et s\u2019ex\u00e9cuter : \u00ab Les enseignants ont un devoir [\u2026] c\u2019est de faire leur m\u00e9tier d\u2019enseignant, donc d\u2019ob\u00e9ir aux directives \u00bb On doit cette belle phrase \u00e0 Henri Guaino, le conseiller sp\u00e9cial de l\u2019\u00c9lys\u00e9e. On admirera la tournure tautologique : les enseignants doivent faire leur m\u00e9tier d\u2019enseignant. Jusque-l\u00e0, je n\u2019apporterai pas la contradiction \u00e0 ce brillant penseur \u00e9lys\u00e9en. En revanche, la conclusion me semble plus que sujette \u00e0 caution. Faire son m\u00e9tier consiste donc \u00e0 \u00ab ob\u00e9ir aux directives \u00bb ! Selon moi \u2014 mais je ne suis qu\u2019un petit fonctionnaire provincial mal pay\u00e9 \u2014 l\u2019enseignant qui fait son devoir a d\u2019autres ambitions que celles d\u2019ex\u00e9cuter des ordres. Au reste, si les nouveaux programmes revendiquent fi\u00e8rement la libert\u00e9 p\u00e9dagogique, ce n\u2019est tout de m\u00eame pas pour la battre en br\u00e8che d\u00e8s qu\u2019un conseiller prend cette parole tout emprunte de rh\u00e9torique pr\u00e9sidentielle, compos\u00e9e de phrases courtes \u00e0 tournure emphatique. Tout cela est certes regrettable, mais on est susceptible dans la profession.","title":"Lire ou ne pas lire Guy M\u00f4quet ?"},{"location":"%C3%89criture/Blog/Liste%20de%20lecture%20pour%20un%20coll%C3%A9gien/","tags":["Blog"],"text":"\ud83d\udd17 Lien non trouv\u00e9 (effac\u00e9 ?)

C\u2019est ce qu\u2019on appelle faire une clean install. Soit. D\u00e9sireux de chasser impitoyablement le moindre bug, j\u2019ai \u00e9vit\u00e9 de r\u00e9importer toutes mes petites donn\u00e9es via Time Machine. Il a donc fallu tout r\u00e9installer \u00e0 la main, \u00e0 l\u2019ancienne : t\u00e9l\u00e9charger les logiciels (je ne les garde plus sur un disque externe, il est tellement plus simple de tout ret\u00e9l\u00e9charger), les installer, les enregistrer, les activer, et tout le tralala. J\u2019installe Photoshop Element. Je poss\u00e8de la version 6 de ce logiciel que j\u2019ai achet\u00e9 il y a quelque temps, soucieux que j\u2019\u00e9tais de ne plus utiliser une version compl\u00e8te d\u2019un logiciel d\u00e9passant mes moyens et intellectuels et financiers (vous voyez ce que je veux dire). J\u2019ai d\u2019ailleurs failli acheter la derni\u00e8re version de Photoshop Element, mais l\u2019essai de 30 jours que j\u2019ai pu en faire ne m\u2019a que tr\u00e8s peu convaincu, et surtout un bug g\u00eanant m\u2019a dissuad\u00e9 de me d\u00e9lester de plus d\u2019une soixantaine d\u2019euros (\u00eatre enseignant, \u00e7a a parfois des avantages), un bug que j\u2019esp\u00e9rais voir dispara\u00eetre avec ma toute r\u00e9cente r\u00e9installation (d\u2019ailleurs \u00e7a m\u2019a rappel\u00e9 la premi\u00e8re installation de Windows XP au d\u00e9but du si\u00e8cle quand je n\u2019utilisais pas encore Mac OS) : avec un compte non administrateur, certaines palettes d\u2019effets ne s\u2019affichent pas, elles ne fonctionnent donc plus ! J\u2019ai essay\u00e9, j\u2019ai repass\u00e9 mon compte en admin, Photoshop Element fonctionne tr\u00e8s bien bien. On peut dire \u00ab bien \u00bb, pas \u00ab tr\u00e8s bien \u00bb : c\u2019est comme \u00e7a que \u00e7a fonctionne chez Adobe : il y a un bug ? N\u2019esp\u00e9rez pas un correctif ! achetez la prochaine version et priez pour que le bug soit corrig\u00e9. Dans le cas qui me pr\u00e9occupe, les versions 7, 8 et 9 ne changent rien \u00e0 l\u2019affaire. Photoshop Element veut fonctionner sur un compte admin. Eh bien non ! C\u2019est un principe : je n\u2019utilise pas un compte administrateur ! Du coup, j\u2019utilise Pixelmator que j\u2019ai achet\u00e9 il y a longtemps d\u00e9j\u00e0 et dont je n\u2019ai pas pay\u00e9 une seule mise \u00e0 jour. \u00c9videmment, une version 2 \u00e9tant pr\u00eate \u00e0 voir le jour, je vais peut-\u00eatre repasser \u00e0 la caisse. Cela dit, quand on voit (ce qu\u2019on voit, dirait Coluche) la derni\u00e8re version de The Gimp , il est permis d\u2019avoir quelques h\u00e9sitations\u2026 Mais ce qui m\u2019a vraiment exasp\u00e9r\u00e9, lors de cette r\u00e9installation de Mac OS, c\u2019est Parallels Desktop , un logiciel qui permet la virtualisation d\u2019un autre syst\u00e8me (vous pouvez installer une distribution Linux ou un Windows sur votre Mac au sein m\u00eame de Mac OS X). Cette possibilit\u00e9 est apparue avec les processeurs x86 quand Apple a abandonn\u00e9 le Power PC (vous avez d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9mul\u00e9 Windows, au fait, sur un PowerBook ?). Le premier a avoir publi\u00e9 son programme, ce n\u2019est pas VMWare , qui s\u2019est fait griller la priorit\u00e9, mais Parallels ! C\u2019est m\u00eame l\u2019un des premiers logiciels que j\u2019ai achet\u00e9 pour mon premier MacBook Pro avec processeur Intel en 2006. L\u2019ann\u00e9e d\u2019apr\u00e8s, j\u2019ai achet\u00e9 la mise \u00e0 jour, j\u2019ai donc achet\u00e9 la version 2, puis la version 3 l\u2019ann\u00e9e suivante, et la version 4 l\u2019ann\u00e9e d\u2019apr\u00e8s. D\u00e9j\u00e0 quelque peu lass\u00e9, j\u2019avais frein\u00e9 des quatre fers, et puis je ne sais plus comment, j\u2019ai tout de m\u00eame obtenu la version 5 (dans un bundle, je crois). L\u2019ann\u00e9e suivante a vu l\u2019apparition de la version 6, et puis plus r\u00e9cemment de la version 7, et si tout se passe bien en 2050, il y aura eu \u00e0 peu pr\u00e8s autant de versions que d\u2019ann\u00e9es dans ce cinquantenaire\u2026 Quoi qu\u2019il en soit, je veux r\u00e9installer Parallels Desktop ! Tout d\u2019abord, je constate la difficult\u00e9 de se procurer la version 5. Heureusement, j\u2019avais tout de m\u00eame, dans un coin d\u2019un de mes disques durs, gard\u00e9 une copie. J\u2019installe et l\u2019installateur me propose de t\u00e9l\u00e9charger une version plus r\u00e9cente (que j\u2019esp\u00e8re \u00eatre la 5 pour laquelle j\u2019ai un num\u00e9ro de s\u00e9rie). La chose se passe avec une lenteur qui indique que leurs serveurs ne sont pas consacr\u00e9s \u00e0 permettre au client de rapatrier une version ancienne. Au bout d\u2019un temps interminable (et d\u2019un \u00e9chec), j\u2019installe la chose\u2026 et paf ! Incompatibilit\u00e9 avec Lion ! Hein ? Quoi ? Tout ou presque est compatible ou rendu compatible avec Lion, et l\u00e0 non ? Hein ? Quoi ? Sur le site de l\u2019\u00e9diteur, on m\u2019apprend que la version 5 restera incompatible avec Lion, cette version qui marchait tr\u00e8s bien avec Snow Leopard, et qui \u2013 alors vraiment tr\u00e8s curieusement \u2013 semblait fonctionner avant formatage du disque sur\u2026 Lion. D\u00e9pit\u00e9, je me fais une raison. Je m\u2019appr\u00eate \u00e0 ressortir une \u00e9ni\u00e8me fois ma carte bleue mon compte Paypal et d\u00e9penser plein d\u2019euros, et puis je me suis dit : \u00abMais quel con ! Pourquoi ne pas t\u00e9l\u00e9charger VirtualBox qui est gratuit ?\u00bb Dont acte. Exit Parallels. Ils sont peut-\u00eatre polis chez Parallels. Dans les mails qu\u2019ils vous adressent pour vous signaler une mise \u00e0 jour payante, ils ne s\u2019adressent pas \u00e0 vous en ces termes : \u00abCh\u00e8re vache \u00e0 lait, nous sommes heureux de vous annoncer la mise \u00e0 jour de, etc., etc.)\u00bb, mais franchement \u00e0 prendre les gens pour des cons, un jour les cons, ils s\u2019en vont. C\u2019\u00e9tait pourtant bien Parallels Desktop, nettement plus abouti que VirtualBox, mais pour l\u2019utilisation que j\u2019en fais, \u00e7a sera suffisant. \u00c9videmment, je ne suis pas contre les mises \u00e0 jour ! C\u2019est g\u00e9nial qu\u2019un programme soit actualis\u00e9 r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement. En revanche, on ne va peut-\u00eatre pas payer la moindre mise \u00e0 jour d\u00e8s qu\u2019on change d\u2019ic\u00f4ne ou qu\u2019une option cach\u00e9e est ajout\u00e9e ! Pixelmator est apparu en 2007, je n\u2019ai pas d\u00e9bours\u00e9 un centime depuis, et pourtant le programme a \u00e9volu\u00e9 tr\u00e8s r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement. Je prendrai tr\u00e8s probablement la version 2. Une mise \u00e0 jour payante tous les quatre ou cinq ans, ce n\u2019est pas l\u2019horreur. Un \u00e9diteur canadien fait de m\u00eame. C\u2019est Druide pour lequel j\u2019ai pay\u00e9 une seule mise \u00e0 jour sur des dizaines ! Du coup, leur logiciel Antidote est peut-\u00eatre un peu cher, mais au regard de ce qu\u2019il permet et de la fr\u00e9quence des mises \u00e0 jour offertes, je veux bien payer. Alors je me demandais ce que j\u2019allais faire : passer au tout libre ou rester sur Mac OS (j\u2019ai quand m\u00eame r\u00e9install\u00e9 Ubuntu sur une partition). J\u2019aime trop Lion pour m\u2019en passer, mais je me fais cette r\u00e9flexion : il y a de plus en plus de logiciels libres sur ma machine : Firefox, LibreOffice, VirtualBox, VLC, etc. Et je me fais ces r\u00e9flexions : heureusement que le libre promeut des standards qui vous permettent ais\u00e9ment de passer d\u2019un syst\u00e8me \u00e0 l\u2019autre ( iWork , c\u2019est bien ! mais uniquement entre Macs, et ne me dites pas qu\u2019on peut \u00abexporter\u00bb). Vive LibreOffice ! Il se lance m\u00eame plus vite que Pages ! Heureusement que des logiciels libres vous permettent de vous affranchir de la voracit\u00e9 commerciale de certains \u00e9diteurs (mais tous ne sont pas \u00e0 mettre dans le m\u00eame panier, on l\u2019a vu) ! Heureusement qu\u2019un navigateur \u2013 Firefox pour ne pas le nommer \u2013 vous offre (litt\u00e9ralement) la possibilit\u00e9 d\u2019avoir une r\u00e9elle vie priv\u00e9e sur internet gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 de tr\u00e8s nombreuses extensions (dont j\u2019ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 parl\u00e9 dans ce billet : Internet tel que je l\u2019utilise ). Heureusement que Linux permet \u00e0 des logiciels d\u2019exister. L\u2019exemple en fera peut-\u00eatre sourire quelques-uns, mais Aircrack-ng existerait-il sur une autre plateforme que Linux (ne me dites pas que \u00e7a existe sur Windows) ? En somme, il y en a pour tout le monde : pour ceux qui veulent payer beaucoup, tout le temps, \u00e0 tort et \u00e0 travers, un peu, parfois, pas du tout. En tout cas, il faudra tout de m\u00eame observer qu\u2019Apple (au moins de fa\u00e7on logicielle) l\u2019a compris : on veut bien payer, mais pas des sommes exorbitantes (\u00e7a d\u00e9pend aussi du type de programme, je veux bien le comprendre). Mac OS X Lion co\u00fbte moins d\u2019une trentaine d\u2019euros, c\u2019est beaucoup, beaucoup moins que Windows.

Rome , \u00e0 qui vient ton bras d'immoler mon amant ! Rome qui t'a vu na\u00eetre, et que ton c\u0153ur adore ! Rome enfin que je hais parce qu'elle t'honore ! Cette figure apporte au mot qu\u2019elle r\u00e9p\u00e8te une importance, une gravit\u00e9, une emphase, quelque grandiloquence \u00e9galement. Elle n\u2019est pas non plus \u00e9trang\u00e8re au rythme, au lyrisme. En tout cas, l\u2019emploi est remarqu\u00e9 et remarquable. Peut-\u00eatre parce qu\u2019il ne passe pas inaper\u00e7u. Simplement. Ladite figure peut devenir une v\u00e9ritable tarte \u00e0 la cr\u00e8me. Je le confesse \u00e0 demi-mot, mais ce po\u00e8me m\u2019\u00e9nerve (po\u00e9tiquement, pas historiquement) : Sur mes cahiers d\u2019\u00e9colier Sur mon pupitre et les arbres Sur le sable sur la neige J\u2019\u00e9cris ton nom Le proc\u00e9d\u00e9 est trop voyant.

Ceux qui d'un haut destin gravissent l'\u00e2pre cime. Ceux qui marchent pensifs, \u00e9pris d'un but sublime. Ou dans L\u2019Ann\u00e9e terrible (sans atteindre la d\u00e9mesure hollandienne) : Dans les si\u00e8cles, dans l'homme antique, dans l'histoire, Dans le pass\u00e9, le\u00e7on qu'\u00e9pelle l'avenir, Dans ce qui commen\u00e7a pour ne jamais finir, Dans les po\u00ebtes ! quoi, dans ce gouffre des bibles, Dans le divin monceau des Eschyles terribles, Des Hom\u00e8res, des Jobs, debout sur l'horizon, Dans Moli\u00e8re, Voltaire et Kant, dans la raison, Tu jettes, mis\u00e9rable, une torche enflamm\u00e9e ! Cependant, cette figure peut aussi provoquer la surprise. Dans ce po\u00e8me de Xavier Forneret (\u00ab Un pauvre honteux \u00bb), les pronoms \u00ab il \u00bb et \u00ab l\u2019 \u00bb (qui pour le coup \u2014 d\u2019un point de vue grammatical \u2014 ne sont pas anaphoriques, mais cataphoriques) sont \u2014 du point de vue stylistique \u2014 anaphorique. C\u2019est cette figure qui fonde tout le po\u00e8me et pr\u00e9pare ainsi, progressivement, la chute. Il l\u2019a tir\u00e9e De sa poche perc\u00e9e, L\u2019a mise sous ses yeux ; Et l\u2019a bien regard\u00e9e En disant : \u201cMalheureux !\u201d [...] Il l'a palp\u00e9e D'une main d\u00e9cid\u00e9e A la faire mourir. \u2014 Oui, c'est une bouch\u00e9e Dont on peut se nourrir. Il l'a pli\u00e9e, Il l'a cass\u00e9e, Il l'a plac\u00e9e, Il l'a coup\u00e9e ; Il l'a lav\u00e9e, Il l'a port\u00e9e, Il l'a grill\u00e9e, Il l'a mang\u00e9e. Quand il n'\u00e9tait pas grand on lui avait dit : Si tu as faim, mange une de tes mains. Vous d\u00e9couvrez alors, \u00e0 la fin du po\u00e8me, que ce \u00ab il \u00bb c\u2019est le pauvre, que le \u00ab l\u2019 \u00bb c\u2019est la main. Cela fait une jolie r\u00e9p\u00e9tition, hein ? De quoi faire p\u00e2lir Fran\u00e7ois Hollande. Et en plus, ce n\u2019est pas le pronom \u00ab moi \u00bb, pronom qu\u2019il vaut mieux \u00e9viter de dire trop souvent, si l\u2019on ne veut pas recevoir cette accusation de grotesque que le camp adverse n\u2019a pas manqu\u00e9 de lui jeter \u00e0 la figure. Au fait, \u00e0 propos d\u2019anaphore ! Il me souvient que celle-ci avait \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9j\u00e0 jet\u00e9e \u00e0 la figure du pr\u00e9sident sortant : Il a pris la France et n\u2019en sait rien faire. En v\u00e9rit\u00e9, on est tent\u00e9 de plaindre cet eunuque se d\u00e9battant avec la toute-puissance. Certes, ce, dictateur s\u2019agite, rendons-lui cette justice ; il ne reste pas un moment tranquille ; il sent autour de lui avec effroi la solitude et les t\u00e9n\u00e8bres ; ceux qui ont peur la nuit chantent, lui il se remue. Il fait rage, il touche \u00e0 tout, il court apr\u00e8s les projets ; ne pouvant cr\u00e9er, il d\u00e9cr\u00e8te ; il cherche \u00e0 donner le change sur sa nullit\u00e9 ; c\u2019est le mouvement perp\u00e9tuel ; mais, h\u00e9las ! cette roue tourne \u00e0 vide.

Mais, apr\u00e8s tout, on se souvient que nombre d\u2019entre eux, en 2007, ont vot\u00e9 au centre et m\u00eame \u00e0 droite pour Nicolas Sarkozy. Quoi qu\u2019il en soit, la question n\u2019est pas vraiment l\u00e0. Il s\u2019agit de voir en quoi la profession d\u2019enseignant peut \u00eatre de droite. Commen\u00e7ons par voir si les propos de Chantal Jouanno peuvent \u00eatre revendiqu\u00e9s par un enseignant.

C\u2019est la fameuse libert\u00e9 p\u00e9dagogique, la libert\u00e9 de faire ce que l\u2019on veut dans sa classe, sans qu\u2019une injonction \u00e9tatique \u00e0 laquelle l\u2019enseignant n\u2019adh\u00e8re pas (celle de la p\u00e9dagogie diff\u00e9renci\u00e9e, celle des comp\u00e9tences, celle des programmes...) vienne entraver sa vision des choses, sa fa\u00e7on de faire, ses habitudes en somme. En un sens, un tel enseignant est un lib\u00e9ral. Le mot est ambigu, car encore au XIXe, dans les pays anglo-saxons aujourd\u2019hui, \u00eatre lib\u00e9ral, c\u2019est \u00eatre de gauche. Mais, ici, il est connot\u00e9 \u00e0 droite. Je me souviens avoir un peu bataill\u00e9, dans un forum pour enseignants, sur la question du d\u00e9terminisme. Je faisais valoir l\u2019id\u00e9e que certains \u00e9l\u00e8ves, d\u2019un milieu tr\u00e8s d\u00e9favoris\u00e9, voyaient leurs chances de r\u00e9ussir \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9cole diminuer comme une peau de chagrin (pas d\u2019argent, pas d\u2019aide pour les devoirs, pas de r\u00e9f\u00e9rences culturelles, etc.). On m\u2019avait r\u00e9torqu\u00e9 que d\u2019aucuns avaient tr\u00e8s bien r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9cole malgr\u00e9 tout cela, et que si l\u2019on voulait, on pouvait, qu\u2019il fallait se battre, etc. Ne retrouve-t-on pas l\u00e0 l\u2019id\u00e9e de la m\u00e9ritocratie ? Cette id\u00e9e que nous ne sommes pas socialement d\u00e9termin\u00e9s, que l\u2019on peut r\u00e9ussir, quel que soit son origine ou son milieu. Cette affirmation m\u2019a toujours laiss\u00e9 perplexe. Je dois reconna\u00eetre que je n\u2019ai jamais eu le c\u0153ur de dire \u00e0 un enfant extr\u00eamement pauvre, qui se fait violer tous les jours, qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 abandonn\u00e9, ou que sais-je encore, qu\u2019il doit se battre, qu\u2019il peut transcender le d\u00e9terminisme qui le laisserait en bas de l\u2019ascenseur social. Voil\u00e0 d\u2019ailleurs bien une id\u00e9e r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e9e \u00e0 sati\u00e9t\u00e9 par le monde enseignant : si l\u2019on veut r\u00e9ussir, il faut faire des efforts. Souvent, le probl\u00e8me est r\u00e9duit \u00e0 cette affirmation : si l\u2019\u00e9l\u00e8ve ne r\u00e9ussit pas, c\u2019est parce qu\u2019il ne travaille pas. L\u2019\u00e9cole, c\u2019est simple comme bonjour. Il y a donc un go\u00fbt prononc\u00e9 pour la m\u00e9ritocratie. Les \u00e9l\u00e8ves qui r\u00e9ussissent sont port\u00e9s aux nues, les autres n\u2019ont pas fait ce qu\u2019il fallait. Ils ont d\u00e9m\u00e9rit\u00e9. Le discours de la peur \u29eb On trouve donc, \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9cole, tout un discours que je qualifierais de droite. Par exemple, celui de la peur. On se souvient peut-\u00eatre de la pr\u00e9sidentielle de 2002. Le th\u00e8me de l\u2019ins\u00e9curit\u00e9 \u00e9tait port\u00e9 par la droite, \u00e0 un tel point d\u2019ailleurs, que cela faisait dire \u00e0 Lionel Jospin qu\u2019on ne cherchait pas \u00e0 \u00e9lire le ministre de l\u2019int\u00e9rieur, mais bien un pr\u00e9sident. On a vu ce que cela lui a co\u00fbt\u00e9. Ce discours anxiog\u00e8ne, je l\u2019ai retrouv\u00e9 dans celui d\u2019enseignants concevant le num\u00e9rique sinon comme un danger potentiel (cf. tel enseignant violent\u00e9 et film\u00e9) du moins une entrave au bon d\u00e9roulement des choses (l\u2019\u00e9l\u00e8ve triche sur son smartphone, il est distrait...). Ce discours est automatiquement li\u00e9 \u00e0 un autre : celui du go\u00fbt d\u2019un \u00e9tat ant\u00e9rieur o\u00f9 le num\u00e9rique n\u2019existait pas. C\u2019\u00e9tait le temps o\u00f9 on ne supprimait pas de postes \u00e0 outrance, c\u2019\u00e9tait le temps o\u00f9 le ma\u00eetre \u00e9tait d\u00e9tenteur de l\u2019autorit\u00e9 incontest\u00e9e, c\u2019\u00e9tait le temps o\u00f9 l\u2019on mettait des notes et l\u2019on ne trouvait rien \u00e0 y redire, c\u2019\u00e9tait le temps o\u00f9 des programmes n\u2019avaient pas boulevers\u00e9 tout un paysage qui faisait que le parent comprenait ce que faisait l\u2019\u00e9l\u00e8ve, c\u2019\u00e9tait le temps o\u00f9 on ne laissait pas passer tout le monde dans la classe sup\u00e9rieure, c\u2019\u00e9tait le temps o\u00f9 tout le monde ne r\u00e9ussissait pas \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9cole (en 1986, seuls 49 % d\u2019\u00e9l\u00e8ves obtiennent le brevet des coll\u00e8ges), c\u2019\u00e9tait le temps o\u00f9 on se concentrait sur l\u2019essentiel (apprendre, lire, compter), c\u2019\u00e9tait le temps d\u2019avant, un temps regrett\u00e9, plus ou moins id\u00e9alis\u00e9, un temps qu\u2019il faudrait restaurer pour retrouver le bonheur perdu. Quand l\u2019enseignant ne comprend plus rien au monde dans lequel il \u00e9volue, quand il achoppe sur les modifications apport\u00e9es \u00e0 un \u00e9tat plus ou moins id\u00e9alis\u00e9, il est permis de voir en lui un r\u00e9actionnaire. Mais le mot n\u2019est pas p\u00e9joratif : le r\u00e9actionnaire r\u00e9agit, il n\u2019accepte pas le monde dans lequel il vit. Il s\u2019oppose \u00e0 l\u2019id\u00e9ologie des comp\u00e9tences, est pour le redoublement, veut que l\u2019\u00e9cole b\u00e2tisse une \u00e9lite, etc. Mais, par un curieux effet de renversement, notre r\u00e9actionnaire se voit en r\u00e9sistant, presque un gauchiste qui s\u2019oppose au discours dominant, alors que je vois en lui un individu de droite pour les raisons que j\u2019ai mentionn\u00e9es plus haut. Un maximum d\u2019enseignant \u29eb Mais on se souvient que ma question \u00e9tait celle-ci : une profession peut-elle engendrer une id\u00e9ologie ? L\u2019enseignant, dans un cas bien pr\u00e9cis, peut-il est autre chose que de droite ? Lui qui est bien souvent assis (pas toujours, il circule dans les rangs), parfois au-dessus des autres (il est sur une estrade qui tend, il est vrai, \u00e0 dispara\u00eetre des salles). Ne peut-on pas se demander si \u00eatre assis et au-dessus des autres n\u2019influe pas sur notre vision du monde ? Bien s\u00fbr, tout cela est symbolique. \u00catre assis, c\u2019est, dit le Petit Robert, \u00eatre affermi, assur\u00e9, ferme, stable. L\u2019enseignant appartient au monde de celui qui a r\u00e9ussi, et a acc\u00e9d\u00e9 \u00e0 un certain statut. On opposera le fait que l\u2019instituteur ne jouit plus de la consid\u00e9ration d\u2019antan, mais j\u2019ai pu remarquer que l\u2019enseignant, dans le monde rural, \u00e9tait per\u00e7u comme \u00e9tant le d\u00e9tenteur d\u2019un savoir, d\u2019un statut (il a fait des \u00e9tudes). Ce n\u2019est pas rien, malgr\u00e9 qu\u2019on en ait. Dans un univers o\u00f9 l\u2019on ne d\u00e9passe parfois pas le brevet des coll\u00e8ges, \u00eatre enseignant est un privil\u00e8ge. Pour filer la m\u00e9taphore des symboles, \u00eatre au-dessus des autres (qu\u2019il y ait estrade ou non), c\u2019est simplement \u00eatre celui qui sait, quand l\u2019\u00e9l\u00e8ve ne sait pas, celui qui interroge, quand l\u2019\u00e9l\u00e8ve doit r\u00e9pondre, celui qui oblige, quand l\u2019\u00e9l\u00e8ve doit ob\u00e9ir... C\u2019est en somme, pour reprendre les termes de Michel Foucault, avoir le pouvoir (refusant ce pouvoir, Michel Foucault se disait \u00eatre \u00abun minimum d\u2019enseignant\u00bb). L\u2019enseignant a le pouvoir. Parfois m\u00eame, il devient directeur d\u2019\u00e9cole, principal adjoint ou principal. Il devient un notable. Il participe aux c\u00e9r\u00e9monies aux c\u00f4t\u00e9s du maire. Apr\u00e8s tout, il a fait de longues \u00e9tudes universitaires. Comment ne pas voir qu\u2019il est loin, tr\u00e8s loin du public auquel il s\u2019adresse ? Il est \u00e0 sa droite. Dans mon prochain billet, je vous dirai pourquoi l\u2019enseignant devrait \u00eatre de gauche.","title":"L\u2019enseignant est il de droite ?"},{"location":"%C3%89criture/Blog/L%E2%80%99enseignant%20est-il%20de%20droite%20%3F/#le-gout-du-passe","text":"Un musicien est un pass\u00e9iste.

Le th\u00e8me de l\u2019ins\u00e9curit\u00e9 \u00e9tait port\u00e9 par la droite, \u00e0 un tel point d\u2019ailleurs, que cela faisait dire \u00e0 Lionel Jospin qu\u2019on ne cherchait pas \u00e0 \u00e9lire le ministre de l\u2019int\u00e9rieur, mais bien un pr\u00e9sident. On a vu ce que cela lui a co\u00fbt\u00e9. Ce discours anxiog\u00e8ne, je l\u2019ai retrouv\u00e9 dans celui d\u2019enseignants concevant le num\u00e9rique sinon comme un danger potentiel (cf. tel enseignant violent\u00e9 et film\u00e9) du moins une entrave au bon d\u00e9roulement des choses (l\u2019\u00e9l\u00e8ve triche sur son smartphone, il est distrait...). Ce discours est automatiquement li\u00e9 \u00e0 un autre : celui du go\u00fbt d\u2019un \u00e9tat ant\u00e9rieur o\u00f9 le num\u00e9rique n\u2019existait pas. C\u2019\u00e9tait le temps o\u00f9 on ne supprimait pas de postes \u00e0 outrance, c\u2019\u00e9tait le temps o\u00f9 le ma\u00eetre \u00e9tait d\u00e9tenteur de l\u2019autorit\u00e9 incontest\u00e9e, c\u2019\u00e9tait le temps o\u00f9 l\u2019on mettait des notes et l\u2019on ne trouvait rien \u00e0 y redire, c\u2019\u00e9tait le temps o\u00f9 des programmes n\u2019avaient pas boulevers\u00e9 tout un paysage qui faisait que le parent comprenait ce que faisait l\u2019\u00e9l\u00e8ve, c\u2019\u00e9tait le temps o\u00f9 on ne laissait pas passer tout le monde dans la classe sup\u00e9rieure, c\u2019\u00e9tait le temps o\u00f9 tout le monde ne r\u00e9ussissait pas \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9cole (en 1986, seuls 49 % d\u2019\u00e9l\u00e8ves obtiennent le brevet des coll\u00e8ges), c\u2019\u00e9tait le temps o\u00f9 on se concentrait sur l\u2019essentiel (apprendre, lire, compter), c\u2019\u00e9tait le temps d\u2019avant, un temps regrett\u00e9, plus ou moins id\u00e9alis\u00e9, un temps qu\u2019il faudrait restaurer pour retrouver le bonheur perdu. Quand l\u2019enseignant ne comprend plus rien au monde dans lequel il \u00e9volue, quand il achoppe sur les modifications apport\u00e9es \u00e0 un \u00e9tat plus ou moins id\u00e9alis\u00e9, il est permis de voir en lui un r\u00e9actionnaire. Mais le mot n\u2019est pas p\u00e9joratif : le r\u00e9actionnaire r\u00e9agit, il n\u2019accepte pas le monde dans lequel il vit. Il s\u2019oppose \u00e0 l\u2019id\u00e9ologie des comp\u00e9tences, est pour le redoublement, veut que l\u2019\u00e9cole b\u00e2tisse une \u00e9lite, etc. Mais, par un curieux effet de renversement, notre r\u00e9actionnaire se voit en r\u00e9sistant, presque un gauchiste qui s\u2019oppose au discours dominant, alors que je vois en lui un individu de droite pour les raisons que j\u2019ai mentionn\u00e9es plus haut.","title":"Le discours de la peur"},{"location":"%C3%89criture/Blog/L%E2%80%99enseignant%20est-il%20de%20droite%20%3F/#un-maximum-denseignant","text":"Mais on se souvient que ma question \u00e9tait celle-ci : une profession peut-elle engendrer une id\u00e9ologie ? L\u2019enseignant, dans un cas bien pr\u00e9cis, peut-il est autre chose que de droite ? Lui qui est bien souvent assis (pas toujours, il circule dans les rangs), parfois au-dessus des autres (il est sur une estrade qui tend, il est vrai, \u00e0 dispara\u00eetre des salles). Ne peut-on pas se demander si \u00eatre assis et au-dessus des autres n\u2019influe pas sur notre vision du monde ? Bien s\u00fbr, tout cela est symbolique. \u00catre assis, c\u2019est, dit le Petit Robert, \u00eatre affermi, assur\u00e9, ferme, stable. L\u2019enseignant appartient au monde de celui qui a r\u00e9ussi, et a acc\u00e9d\u00e9 \u00e0 un certain statut. On opposera le fait que l\u2019instituteur ne jouit plus de la consid\u00e9ration d\u2019antan, mais j\u2019ai pu remarquer que l\u2019enseignant, dans le monde rural, \u00e9tait per\u00e7u comme \u00e9tant le d\u00e9tenteur d\u2019un savoir, d\u2019un statut (il a fait des \u00e9tudes). Ce n\u2019est pas rien, malgr\u00e9 qu\u2019on en ait. Dans un univers o\u00f9 l\u2019on ne d\u00e9passe parfois pas le brevet des coll\u00e8ges, \u00eatre enseignant est un privil\u00e8ge. Pour filer la m\u00e9taphore des symboles, \u00eatre au-dessus des autres (qu\u2019il y ait estrade ou non), c\u2019est simplement \u00eatre celui qui sait, quand l\u2019\u00e9l\u00e8ve ne sait pas, celui qui interroge, quand l\u2019\u00e9l\u00e8ve doit r\u00e9pondre, celui qui oblige, quand l\u2019\u00e9l\u00e8ve doit ob\u00e9ir... C\u2019est en somme, pour reprendre les termes de Michel Foucault, avoir le pouvoir (refusant ce pouvoir, Michel Foucault se disait \u00eatre \u00abun minimum d\u2019enseignant\u00bb). L\u2019enseignant a le pouvoir. Parfois m\u00eame, il devient directeur d\u2019\u00e9cole, principal adjoint ou principal. Il devient un notable. Il participe aux c\u00e9r\u00e9monies aux c\u00f4t\u00e9s du maire. Apr\u00e8s tout, il a fait de longues \u00e9tudes universitaires. Comment ne pas voir qu\u2019il est loin, tr\u00e8s loin du public auquel il s\u2019adresse ? Il est \u00e0 sa droite.

J\u2019ai donc lu son billet sur la dict\u00e9e sans aucun a priori. Et je l\u2019ai trouv\u00e9 mauvais. Il est mal \u00e9crit. Les r\u00e9p\u00e9titions (\u00abun niveau tr\u00e8s bas bas\u00bb), les oublis (\u00abc\u2019est sorte de pathologie gravissime\u00bb), les erreurs typographiques (\u00abl\u2019 hallucination\u00bb) ou inqualifiables (\u00abauFormati\u00e0oncune r\u00e9flexion\u00bb) r\u00e9v\u00e8lent-ils qu\u2019il a \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9dig\u00e9 \u00e0 la h\u00e2te ? Je ne sais pas, mais il m\u2019a profond\u00e9ment constern\u00e9. Jusque-l\u00e0, seule l\u2019affaire du pourrisseur du web avait r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 me sortir de ma torpeur habituelle. Au reste, le discours d\u2019Eveline Charmeux m\u2019a rappel\u00e9 celui qui \u00e9tait tenu \u00e0 l\u2019IUFM o\u00f9 la dict\u00e9e \u00e9tait battue en br\u00e8che. Les arguments ne manquaient d\u2019ailleurs pas de pertinence. La dict\u00e9e ne serait qu\u2019un moyen d\u2019\u00e9valuation injuste, elle ne permettrait pas d\u2019acqu\u00e9rir de connaissances. Elle \u00e9tait tomb\u00e9e de son pi\u00e9destal. Elle n\u2019\u00e9tait plus le seul moyen de travailler l\u2019orthographe (que l\u2019on songe \u00e0 l\u2019exercice de r\u00e9\u00e9criture). J\u2019\u00e9tais alors convaincu qu\u2019il ne fallait plus faire de dict\u00e9e ou du moins qu\u2019il ne fallait plus lui accorder l\u2019importance qui fut la sienne. Las ! Cette id\u00e9e n\u2019a pas r\u00e9sist\u00e9 au temps, lequel j\u2019ai pass\u00e9 \u00e0 me demander de quelle fa\u00e7on je pouvais \u00e9valuer l\u2019orthographe sans pour autant d\u00e9primer mes petits \u00e9l\u00e8ves. Prol\u00e9gom\u00e8nes \u29eb Avant d\u2019expliquer les vertus p\u00e9dagogiques que j\u2019attribue \u00e0 la dict\u00e9e, je voudrais tout de m\u00eame pr\u00e9ciser deux petites choses. Eveline Charmeux \u00e9crit que la dict\u00e9e a : [...] l\u2019incomparable plaisir que procure \u00e0 tout enseignant \u2014 moi la premi\u00e8re, je le confesse bien volontiers ! \u2014 cette situation de pouvoir absolu sur des \u00e9l\u00e8ves, soumis, visage baiss\u00e9, au rythme de la voix du ma\u00eetre, seul \u00e0 poss\u00e9der l\u00e9gitimement le \"corrig\u00e9\"... La dict\u00e9e, c\u2019est le symbole de l\u2019\u00e9cole, de celle qui fait faire aux \u00e9l\u00e8ves ce qu\u2019ils ne savent pas faire [...] Tout d\u2019abord, je n\u2019\u00e9prouve aucun \u00abincomparable plaisir\u00bb face \u00e0 des \u00e9l\u00e8ves soumis. Je suis conscient \u00e0 ce point du pouvoir de l\u2019enseignant que j\u2019ai pris l\u2019habitude depuis longtemps de faire cours porte ouverte, cette ouverture me rappelant le monde ext\u00e9rieur dans lequel je ne suis pas le ma\u00eetre ni le pl\u00e9nipotentiaire de l\u2019\u00e9ducation lequel, comme un mauvais parent, aurait tous les droits sur ses enfants dans le huis clos de son domicile. Au reste, je n\u2019ai pas la vanit\u00e9 de go\u00fbter au plaisir de ma voix qui s\u2019\u00e9nonce dans le silence scolaire, dominant des \u00abvisage (s) baiss\u00e9 (s)\u00bb. Qu\u2019est-ce que c\u2019est que cette id\u00e9e ? Que veut-on ? Que l\u2019on s\u2019humilie d\u2019avoir assis les \u00e9l\u00e8ves quand nous sommes debout ? Eh ! Voulez-vous que l\u2019on intervertisse la situation ? Tout le monde debout ! Je m\u2019assieds. Enfin, la dict\u00e9e serait un symbole. Celui d\u2019une \u00e9cole qui fait faire aux \u00e9l\u00e8ves ce qu\u2019ils ne savent pas faire. Serait-ce une plaisanterie de mauvais go\u00fbt ? Un pi\u00e8ge tendu aux esprits chagrins qui lisent en diagonale ? Qu\u2019est-ce que l\u2019\u00e9cole sinon le lieu o\u00f9 l\u2019on apprend ce que l\u2019on ne sait pas ? Le contraire s\u2019appelle la science infuse. Les \u00e9l\u00e8ves ne l\u2019ayant pas, ils viennent apprendre. En quoi cela peut-il choquer ? Un moyen d\u2019apprentissage et un moyen d\u2019\u00e9valuation \u29eb Selon Eveline Charmeux, la dict\u00e9e ne saurait \u00eatre ce monstre p\u00e9dagogique \u00e9tant \u00e0 la fois la fin et le moyen. Je pense que les termes sont mal d\u00e9finis, et comme \u00e0 chaque fois que l\u2019on nomme mal les choses, on se fourvoie. Par quelque bout que l\u2019on prenne les choses, pas moyen de faire autrement : la p\u00e9riode d\u2019apprentissage est ipso facto suivie d\u2019une \u00e9valuation. Il faut n\u00e9cessairement v\u00e9rifier que la notion inculqu\u00e9e a \u00e9t\u00e9 comprise. Dans le cas contraire, on se hasarde \u00e0 laisser les \u00e9l\u00e8ves avancer dans les m\u00e9andres du programme sans s\u2019int\u00e9resser \u00e0 leurs progr\u00e8s ou leurs \u00e9checs. Mais la question est de savoir si la dict\u00e9e peut \u00e0 la fois \u00eatre un moyen d\u2019apprentissage et un moyen d\u2019\u00e9valuation. Un moyen d\u2019\u00e9valuation \u29eb Avant de dire en quoi la dict\u00e9e est un moyen d\u2019apprentissage, voyons le moyen d\u2019\u00e9valuation. En quoi est-il choquant d\u2019\u00e9valuer ce qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9crit ? Serait-ce parce qu\u2019on attribue une note ? Que l\u2019on soup\u00e7onne celle-ci d\u2019\u00eatre tr\u00e8s basse ? Sans m\u00eame parler d\u2019\u00e9valuation par comp\u00e9tences, ne peut-on simplement dire \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9l\u00e8ve \u00e0 qui l\u2019on rend sa dict\u00e9e : \u00abC\u2019est bien, il n\u2019y a pas de faute. \u00c0 pr\u00e9sent, on va faire plus dur ou on va passer \u00e0 autre chose\u00bb ou encore \u00abAttention, il y a des fautes. Tel ou tel point est \u00e0 revoir. Je vais te donner des exercices pour rem\u00e9dier \u00e0 cette situation\u00bb. La dict\u00e9e est l\u2019\u00e9valuation de ce que sait faire un \u00e9l\u00e8ve \u00e0 un moment donn\u00e9. Ainsi, par exemple, le pr\u00e9sent de l\u2019indicatif ayant fait l\u2019objet d\u2019un apprentissage ne devrait pas \u00eatre erron\u00e9 dans le texte faisant l\u2019objet d\u2019une dict\u00e9e. S\u2019il l\u2019est, il faut r\u00e9viser. De toute fa\u00e7on, je ne crois pas qu\u2019il existe encore beaucoup d\u2019enseignants qui ponctionnent deux voire quatre points par faute de grammaire. En ce cas, l\u2019exercice est impitoyable. Quelques fautes dans un texte de vingt lignes, et l\u2019\u00e9l\u00e8ve n\u2019a pas la moyenne. Cette fa\u00e7on de faire n\u2019a plus, depuis longtemps, la faveur des enseignants. Et je crois que c\u2019est ce mod\u00e8le qu\u2019Eveline Charmeux bat en br\u00e8che. Celui de l\u2019enseignant qui pour enseigner l\u2019orthographe ne poss\u00e9derait que ce seul moyen de la dict\u00e9e et par l\u00e0 m\u00eame se saisirait de ce moyen pour mettre une note qui souvent atteint des abysses n\u00e9gatifs. Afin de ne pas allonger ind\u00e9finiment ce billet d\u00e9j\u00e0 tr\u00e8s long, j\u2019ai \u00e9crit un autre billet intitul\u00e9 Mais comment \u00e9valuer cette dict\u00e9e ? Tout au plus, dirais-je qu\u2019il y a pl\u00e9thore quant aux moyens d\u2019\u00e9valuer une dict\u00e9e, et que celle-ci n\u2019est plus l\u2019exercice terrible condamnant par avance tout \u00e9l\u00e8ve pris en faute. Un moyen d\u2019apprentissage \u29eb Examinons maintenant en quoi la dict\u00e9e, not\u00e9e ou non, mais \u00e9valu\u00e9e (en tant qu\u2019elle fait l\u2019objet d\u2019une appr\u00e9ciation, et donc d\u2019un moyen de progresser), concourt \u00e0 l\u2019am\u00e9lioration de l\u2019orthographe des \u00e9l\u00e8ves. On l\u2019a dit, il existe d\u2019autres moyens d\u2019apprentissage (parmi lesquels il y a l\u2019exercice de r\u00e9\u00e9criture , mais aussi la charade , le pendu , les mots crois\u00e9s sans m\u00eame parler de la r\u00e9daction). \u00c0 ce propos, le billet d\u2019Eveline Charmeux repose sur un malentendu. Je n\u2019ai lu nulle part que l\u2019on pr\u00e9tendait que la dict\u00e9e \u00e9tait LA solution. Tout au plus peut-on parler de solution, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire d\u2019une solution entre autres. D\u2019embl\u00e9e, je suis choqu\u00e9 que l\u2019on soit choqu\u00e9 quand on fait faire une dict\u00e9e qui date des ann\u00e9es 80 \u00e0 des \u00e9l\u00e8ves d\u2019aujourd\u2019hui qui n\u2019en font plus. Eh quoi ! On a tellement expliqu\u00e9 que la dict\u00e9e, c\u2019\u00e9tait le mal, que les enseignants ont fini par s\u2019en convaincre, et n\u2019en font plus (heureusement, cela change). D\u00e8s lors, des \u00e9l\u00e8ves ne peuvent plus r\u00e9ussir un exercice qu\u2019ils ne pratiquent plus ou pas assez. En quoi cela est-il \u00e9tonnant ? On apprend en faisant (oui, je suis pour la p\u00e9dagogie active). Or j\u2019ai la conviction qu\u2019il est fondamental que l\u2019on dise aux \u00e9l\u00e8ves : \u00abOn va \u00e9crire un texte, et ce qui fait l\u2019objet de ce travail, c\u2019est l\u2019orthographe et rien que l\u2019orthographe\u00bb. Les \u00e9l\u00e8ves, aujourd\u2019hui ou hier (qu\u2019importe), r\u00e9duisent tellement la chose \u00e9crite \u00e0 la portion congrue (un contenu plus qu\u2019un contenant), que je ne connais pas un coll\u00e8gue d\u2019histoire, de SVT ou de ce que vous voulez qui n\u2019ait rencontr\u00e9 la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 d\u2019\u00e9valuer l\u2019orthographe tant il est vrai que les \u00e9l\u00e8ves s\u2019en d\u00e9sint\u00e9ressent. J\u2019en suis m\u00eame venu \u00e0 ne plus photocopier mes contr\u00f4les, mais \u00e0 les projeter, \u00e0 demander aux \u00e9l\u00e8ves d\u2019\u00e9crire les consignes, et de leur dire qu\u2019ils gagneront des points en accordant un peu d\u2019attention aux mots qu\u2019ils recopient. La dict\u00e9e, qu\u2019elle fasse deux lignes ou trente, r\u00e9guli\u00e8re, et d\u2019une difficult\u00e9 en rapport avec le niveau des \u00e9l\u00e8ves, consiste \u00e0 \u00e9couter un texte et \u00e0 faire des choix. Je ne parle pas du ridicule exemple pris par le contempteur de la dict\u00e9e. \u00abth\u00e9\u00e2tre\u00bb ou \u00abap\u00e9ritif\u00bb ne m\u2019int\u00e9ressent pas. C\u2019est de l\u2019orthographe lexicale. Un dictionnaire fera l\u2019affaire. Ce n\u2019est pas l\u00e0 que le b\u00e2t blesse. De toute fa\u00e7on, quand bien m\u00eame la chose est not\u00e9e, l\u2019\u00e9l\u00e8ve perd 1 voire 0,5 point et m\u00eame rien du tout dans certain cas. En revanche, on peut estimer que, jusqu\u2019\u00e0 ce qu\u2019on ait rencontr\u00e9 la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 d\u2019\u00e9crire ce mot, on ne savait pas comment l\u2019\u00e9crire. Quel autre exercice que la r\u00e9daction ou la dict\u00e9e permet de prendre conscience que l\u2019on ne sait pas \u00e9crire tel ou tel mot ? Si on ne sait pas, on cherche, on corrige, on apprend (apr\u00e8s avoir not\u00e9 le mot dans un calepin pour le r\u00e9viser, le r\u00e9utiliser, etc.). Mais, je l\u2019ai dit, ce n\u2019est pas l\u00e0 l\u2019essentiel. La dict\u00e9e doit permettre \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9l\u00e8ve de faire des choix : tel mot s\u2019accorde-t-il avec tel autre ? A-t-on bien choisi parmi des homophones grammaticaux ? Serait-ce \u00abses\u00bb, \u00abces\u00bb, \u00abc\u2019est\u00bb ou m\u00eame \u00absait\u00bb ? Et si l\u2019on veut adopter \u00abune p\u00e9dagogie de la pr\u00e9vention des erreurs\u00bb, l\u2019on peut se pencher sur l\u2019\u00e9l\u00e8ve que l\u2019on aiguille sur la bonne voie. Je ne commenterais pas la pitoyable m\u00e9taphore routi\u00e8re, et sa conclusion : Aussi, obliger les enfants \u00e0 r\u00e9fl\u00e9chir, donc \u00e0 ralentir leur \u00e9criture, n\u2019est certainement pas un service \u00e0 leur rendre.

S\u2019il l\u2019est, il faut r\u00e9viser. De toute fa\u00e7on, je ne crois pas qu\u2019il existe encore beaucoup d\u2019enseignants qui ponctionnent deux voire quatre points par faute de grammaire. En ce cas, l\u2019exercice est impitoyable. Quelques fautes dans un texte de vingt lignes, et l\u2019\u00e9l\u00e8ve n\u2019a pas la moyenne. Cette fa\u00e7on de faire n\u2019a plus, depuis longtemps, la faveur des enseignants. Et je crois que c\u2019est ce mod\u00e8le qu\u2019Eveline Charmeux bat en br\u00e8che. Celui de l\u2019enseignant qui pour enseigner l\u2019orthographe ne poss\u00e9derait que ce seul moyen de la dict\u00e9e et par l\u00e0 m\u00eame se saisirait de ce moyen pour mettre une note qui souvent atteint des abysses n\u00e9gatifs.

On l\u2019a dit, il existe d\u2019autres moyens d\u2019apprentissage (parmi lesquels il y a l\u2019exercice de r\u00e9\u00e9criture , mais aussi la charade , le pendu , les mots crois\u00e9s sans m\u00eame parler de la r\u00e9daction). \u00c0 ce propos, le billet d\u2019Eveline Charmeux repose sur un malentendu. Je n\u2019ai lu nulle part que l\u2019on pr\u00e9tendait que la dict\u00e9e \u00e9tait LA solution. Tout au plus peut-on parler de solution, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire d\u2019une solution entre autres. D\u2019embl\u00e9e, je suis choqu\u00e9 que l\u2019on soit choqu\u00e9 quand on fait faire une dict\u00e9e qui date des ann\u00e9es 80 \u00e0 des \u00e9l\u00e8ves d\u2019aujourd\u2019hui qui n\u2019en font plus. Eh quoi ! On a tellement expliqu\u00e9 que la dict\u00e9e, c\u2019\u00e9tait le mal, que les enseignants ont fini par s\u2019en convaincre, et n\u2019en font plus (heureusement, cela change). D\u00e8s lors, des \u00e9l\u00e8ves ne peuvent plus r\u00e9ussir un exercice qu\u2019ils ne pratiquent plus ou pas assez. En quoi cela est-il \u00e9tonnant ? On apprend en faisant (oui, je suis pour la p\u00e9dagogie active). Or j\u2019ai la conviction qu\u2019il est fondamental que l\u2019on dise aux \u00e9l\u00e8ves : \u00abOn va \u00e9crire un texte, et ce qui fait l\u2019objet de ce travail, c\u2019est l\u2019orthographe et rien que l\u2019orthographe\u00bb. Les \u00e9l\u00e8ves, aujourd\u2019hui ou hier (qu\u2019importe), r\u00e9duisent tellement la chose \u00e9crite \u00e0 la portion congrue (un contenu plus qu\u2019un contenant), que je ne connais pas un coll\u00e8gue d\u2019histoire, de SVT ou de ce que vous voulez qui n\u2019ait rencontr\u00e9 la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 d\u2019\u00e9valuer l\u2019orthographe tant il est vrai que les \u00e9l\u00e8ves s\u2019en d\u00e9sint\u00e9ressent. J\u2019en suis m\u00eame venu \u00e0 ne plus photocopier mes contr\u00f4les, mais \u00e0 les projeter, \u00e0 demander aux \u00e9l\u00e8ves d\u2019\u00e9crire les consignes, et de leur dire qu\u2019ils gagneront des points en accordant un peu d\u2019attention aux mots qu\u2019ils recopient. La dict\u00e9e, qu\u2019elle fasse deux lignes ou trente, r\u00e9guli\u00e8re, et d\u2019une difficult\u00e9 en rapport avec le niveau des \u00e9l\u00e8ves, consiste \u00e0 \u00e9couter un texte et \u00e0 faire des choix. Je ne parle pas du ridicule exemple pris par le contempteur de la dict\u00e9e. \u00abth\u00e9\u00e2tre\u00bb ou \u00abap\u00e9ritif\u00bb ne m\u2019int\u00e9ressent pas. C\u2019est de l\u2019orthographe lexicale. Un dictionnaire fera l\u2019affaire. Ce n\u2019est pas l\u00e0 que le b\u00e2t blesse. De toute fa\u00e7on, quand bien m\u00eame la chose est not\u00e9e, l\u2019\u00e9l\u00e8ve perd 1 voire 0,5 point et m\u00eame rien du tout dans certain cas. En revanche, on peut estimer que, jusqu\u2019\u00e0 ce qu\u2019on ait rencontr\u00e9 la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 d\u2019\u00e9crire ce mot, on ne savait pas comment l\u2019\u00e9crire. Quel autre exercice que la r\u00e9daction ou la dict\u00e9e permet de prendre conscience que l\u2019on ne sait pas \u00e9crire tel ou tel mot ? Si on ne sait pas, on cherche, on corrige, on apprend (apr\u00e8s avoir not\u00e9 le mot dans un calepin pour le r\u00e9viser, le r\u00e9utiliser, etc.). Mais, je l\u2019ai dit, ce n\u2019est pas l\u00e0 l\u2019essentiel. La dict\u00e9e doit permettre \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9l\u00e8ve de faire des choix : tel mot s\u2019accorde-t-il avec tel autre ? A-t-on bien choisi parmi des homophones grammaticaux ? Serait-ce \u00abses\u00bb, \u00abces\u00bb, \u00abc\u2019est\u00bb ou m\u00eame \u00absait\u00bb ? Et si l\u2019on veut adopter \u00abune p\u00e9dagogie de la pr\u00e9vention des erreurs\u00bb, l\u2019on peut se pencher sur l\u2019\u00e9l\u00e8ve que l\u2019on aiguille sur la bonne voie. Je ne commenterais pas la pitoyable m\u00e9taphore routi\u00e8re, et sa conclusion : Aussi, obliger les enfants \u00e0 r\u00e9fl\u00e9chir, donc \u00e0 ralentir leur \u00e9criture, n\u2019est certainement pas un service \u00e0 leur rendre. Cette phrase qui vient conclure la m\u00e9taphore fil\u00e9e du moniteur d\u2019auto\u00e9cole nous explique donc que celui-ci ne rendra pas service \u00e0 son \u00e9l\u00e8ve qu\u2019il invite \u00e0 ralentir. Vraiment ? \u00c9crase-toi contre la voiture d\u2019en face, on verra apr\u00e8s... Et je ne parlerai m\u00eame pas de l\u2019opposition \u00e9nonc\u00e9/\u00e9nonciation qui, je le suppose, est le point d\u2019orgue dans la d\u00e9monstration de l\u2019auteure (veut-elle un \u00abe\u00bb ?) : Or, la dict\u00e9e est doublement \u00e9trang\u00e8re \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9nonciation : parole ext\u00e9rieure, \u00e9labor\u00e9e par quelqu\u2019un d\u2019autre, elle est re\u00e7ue passivement, et \u00e0 travers une oralisation du dicteur, laquelle n\u2019a rien \u00e0 voir avec la prononciation mentale qui accompagne l\u2019\u00e9nonciation.

Depuis, je me suis dit que sa pratique r\u00e9guli\u00e8re devait faire progresser les \u00e9l\u00e8ves, \u00e0 condition de ne pas mettre de z\u00e9ros \u00e0 tout va. Mais alors comment \u00e9valuer cette dict\u00e9e remise au go\u00fbt du jour ? Je me pose r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement cette question, car quoiqu\u2019on en dise il faut bien le faire. En tout cas, on attend de moi que je mette des notes, alors que je pourrais fort bien m\u2019en passer, surtout \u00e0 propos de ce type d\u2019\u00e9valuation de l\u2019orthographe. De toute fa\u00e7on, les notes - surtout depuis que j\u2019ai entendu Andr\u00e9 Antibi - ne me d\u00e9rangent pas plus que \u00e7a (mais c\u2019est un autre sujet). Alors, si l\u2019on doit en mettre, voyons comment l\u2019on peut faire. Avant de r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 la question pos\u00e9e par l\u2019article, je pr\u00e9cise quand m\u00eame que je n\u2019ai pas encore trouv\u00e9 la bonne formule, raison pour quoi j\u2019\u00e9cris cet article, peut-\u00eatre pour me permettre d\u2019y voir plus clair. La seule conviction que j\u2019aie est qu\u2019il faille faire des dict\u00e9es, malgr\u00e9 qu\u2019on en ait. Soumettre \u00e0 la sagacit\u00e9 d\u2019un \u00e9l\u00e8ve une difficult\u00e9 orthographique \u00e0 r\u00e9soudre ne me semble pas devoir \u00eatre vou\u00e9 aux g\u00e9monies. \u00c0 l\u2019ancienne \u29eb Je crois savoir que certains coll\u00e8gues font \u00e7a : ils retirent deux points par faute de grammaire, un point par faute d\u2019orthographe lexicale (des fautes de vocabulaire en somme), et un demi-point par accent. En notant ainsi, dans certaines classes, on est \u00e0 peu pr\u00e8s certain d\u2019avoir \u00e9vit\u00e9 de mettre la moyenne aux meilleurs, et d\u2019avoir mis des notes n\u00e9gatives \u00e0 80 % de la classe. Or une telle fa\u00e7on de noter, \u00e0 coup s\u00fbr, d\u00e9moralise les \u00e9l\u00e8ves les mieux intentionn\u00e9s : pourquoi travailler puisque de toute fa\u00e7on ils auront z\u00e9ro, l\u2019exercice \u00e9tant cruellement difficile. Cependant, un tel degr\u00e9 d\u2019exigence dans la notation, pourrait \u00eatre concevable avec d\u2019excellents \u00e9l\u00e8ves. J\u2019en ai, mais pour ceux-l\u00e0, quelle que soit la fa\u00e7on de noter, le r\u00e9sultat est invariablement le m\u00eame : ils ont vingt. En somme, cette r\u00e9flexion ne les concerne pas vraiment. Avec un bar\u00e8me moins s\u00e9v\u00e8re \u29eb On obtient des notes un peu moins mauvaises en ne retirant qu\u2019un point par faute de grammaire, et un demi-point par faute de vocabulaire. Mais franchement, les notes ne sont pas pour autant extraordinaires. On limite les d\u00e9g\u00e2ts, et on n\u2019\u00e9vite pas la sempiternelle cohorte de z\u00e9ros. J\u2019utilise souvent ce bar\u00e8me avec des dict\u00e9es relativement courtes, et ne contenant pas trop de difficult\u00e9s. L\u2019\u00e9l\u00e8ve a m\u00eame la possibilit\u00e9 de refaire la dict\u00e9e. On efface la note. On recommence. On progresse, j\u2019esp\u00e8re. La dict\u00e9e pr\u00e9par\u00e9e \u29eb Je d\u00e9teste. J\u2019ai toujours le sentiment de perdre mon temps. Pourtant j\u2019ai essay\u00e9 \u00e0 de nombreuses reprises : je dicte un texte ; c\u2019est non not\u00e9 ; on le corrige ; on fournit les explications ; \u00e9ventuellement on s\u2019entra\u00eene ; on demande aux \u00e9l\u00e8ves d\u2019apprendre ; on refait la dict\u00e9e. Ratage complet. Il faut bien le reconna\u00eetre. Les \u00e9l\u00e8ves dont l\u2019orthographe est mauvaise sont tr\u00e8s souvent (je n\u2019ai pas dit toujours) des \u00e9l\u00e8ves qui ne travaillent pas suffisamment ou pas comme il faut ou, et c\u2019est (certaines ann\u00e9es) l\u2019\u00e9crasante majorit\u00e9, pas du tout. Alors si on leur donne un texte \u00e0 apprendre pour qu\u2019ils obtiennent une note d\u00e9cente, il ne faut pas forc\u00e9ment s\u2019attendre \u00e0 ce qu\u2019ils fassent le travail demand\u00e9. Au bout du compte, on se dit qu\u2019il doit y avoir des progr\u00e8s en orthographe gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 une pratique fr\u00e9quente, pas n\u00e9cessairement par un gros travail d\u2019apprentissage de texte donn\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019avance. Par segments \u29eb Alors, celle-l\u00e0, cela fait un moment que l\u2019on ne me l\u2019a pas impos\u00e9e. J\u2019ai \u00abd\u00fb\u00bb noter des dict\u00e9es une ann\u00e9e lors de la correction du brevet. Le principe est simple : on consid\u00e8re un segment donn\u00e9, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire un bout de phrase pour lequel on ne retira pas plus de tant de points. Par exemple, dans la phrase \u00ab...\u00bb, on consid\u00e8re que \u00ab...\u00bb est un segment qui vaut tant de points. S\u2019il y a plus de tant de fautes, on soustrait le nombre de points fix\u00e9s. Autant dire, que je d\u00e9teste cette fa\u00e7on de faire. C\u2019est vraiment se compliquer l\u2019existence pour pas grand-chose. Des points pour la grammaire, des points pour le vocabulaire \u29eb Cette fa\u00e7on de faire est plus int\u00e9ressante. Pour une dict\u00e9e sur vingt, on va accorder dix points pour la grammaire, dix points pour le vocabulaire. On d\u00e9compte un point ou un demi-point par faute (par exemple). Or si l\u2019\u00e9l\u00e8ve a fait 30 fautes de grammaire, il ne perd pas plus de dix points. Et le correcteur de prier, pour que l\u2019\u00e9l\u00e8ve n\u2019ait pas fait trop de fautes de vocabulaire, ce qui lui permet alors de ne pas obtenir une note trop basse. Cela marche bien pour les \u00e9l\u00e8ves qui ont quelque comp\u00e9tence orthographique, mais qui ont encore pas mal de lacunes en grammaire ou en vocabulaire. Cela permet aussi de voir avec pr\u00e9cision ce qui p\u00e8che, si c\u2019est la grammaire (conjugaison, accords, etc.) ou si c\u2019est le vocabulaire, et de proposer la rem\u00e9diation idoine. La dict\u00e9e portant sur un point pr\u00e9cis \u29eb On dicte un texte apr\u00e8s avoir \u00e9tudi\u00e9 tel ou tel point et dans la dict\u00e9e, on n\u2019\u00e9value que le point \u00e9tudi\u00e9. Par exemple, si on a \u00e9tudi\u00e9 l\u2019accord des adjectifs qualificatifs ou le pass\u00e9 simple, on ne prend en compte dans la correction que l\u2019accord des adjectifs qualificatifs ou le pass\u00e9 simple.

Tout d\u2019abord, sa m\u00e9tamorphose est surprenante puisqu\u2019il s\u2019est transform\u00e9 en ce qui est cens\u00e9 le remplacer. Autrefois un nom (du latin homo, hominis), il est devenu un pronom dont la tournure \u00ab l\u2019on \u00bb (utilis\u00e9e essentiellement pour \u00e9viter un hiatus) t\u00e9moigne encore. Ne d\u00e9signant g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement personne (il est pour cela appel\u00e9 pronom ind\u00e9fini), il est rang\u00e9 parmi les pronoms personnels. Enfin, mot singulier, il est trop souvent ressenti comme un pluriel. En effet, nombre d\u2019individus s\u2019obstinent \u00e0 accorder le participe pass\u00e9 avec \u00ab on \u00bb. R\u00e9cemment, j\u2019ai encore lu ceci : \u00ab On s\u2019est bien amus\u00e9s \u00bb. Sauf erreur de ma part, le sujet \u00e9tant au singulier, l\u2019auxiliaire \u00e9galement, le participe devrait l\u2019\u00eatre aussi. Pourquoi accorder ce participe en d\u00e9pit du sujet et de l\u2019auxiliaire au singulier ? La seule r\u00e9ponse \u2014 peu satisfaisante \u2014 est que ce \u00ab on \u00bb est ressenti comme un pluriel. Il est d\u2019ailleurs pronominalisable en \u00ab nous \u00bb : \u00ab Nous, on s\u2019est bien amus\u00e9s \u00bb Dans ce cas, ce n\u2019est plus la grammaire (un ensemble de r\u00e8gles morpho-syntaxiques et s\u00e9mantiques) qui pr\u00e9vaut, mais le seul crit\u00e8re s\u00e9mantique, un peu comme avec \u00ab la plupart \u00bb. On dira, en effet, \u00ab La plupart se sont amus\u00e9s \u00bb et non \u00ab La plupart s\u2019est amus\u00e9 \u00bb (\u00e7a peut se comprendre. La tournure est elliptique. Il faut entendre \u00abLa plupart des gens se sont amus\u00e9s \u00bb). On reconna\u00eetra que la grammaire est constitu\u00e9e de tout cela ; ce sont la morphologie, la syntaxe et le s\u00e9mantisme qui font la grammaire, et que parfois d\u00e9m\u00ealer entre ces trois-l\u00e0 est bien difficile. En ce cas, je ne peux m\u2019emp\u00eacher de penser, qu\u2019il faudrait aller jusqu\u2019au bout et \u00e9crire : \u00ab On se sont bien amus\u00e9s \u00bb.

Le haut d\u00e9bit sous les cocotiers \u29eb ![[adsl-en-caledonie.jpg]] Quand j\u2019ai quitt\u00e9 la Nouvelle-Cal\u00e9donie, j\u2019avais internet. Pas du bas d\u00e9bit, de l\u2019ADSL s\u2019il vous pla\u00eet (en 2004 il me semble). Certes en 256 ko/s mais de l\u2019ADSL quand m\u00eame. Une fois mon s\u00e9jour achev\u00e9 et conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 la loi, le fonctionnaire que je suis a \u00e9t\u00e9 pri\u00e9 - au terme d\u2019une dur\u00e9e de quatre ans - de retourner sur le territoire de ses anc\u00eatres (en 2006, \u00e7a c\u2019est s\u00fbr). Dont acte. La somme de mes points m\u2019a permis d\u2019obtenir la Champagne-Ardenne. Quel chanceux je fais ! Quand je pense que j\u2019aurais pu avoir Biarritz ! Je m\u2019y installe et pense d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e0 ma future connexion internet. Las ! je d\u00e9couvre que je ne pourrai avoir que du bas d\u00e9bit ! Mis\u00e8re... Quid facimus ? pensais-je in petto. Bah rien... En plein travaux de r\u00e9novation de la b\u00e2tisse que j\u2019ai acquise que la banque poss\u00e8de, je re\u00e7ois un coup de fil. Une voix doucereuse venue du service commercial d\u2019Orange me d\u00e9clare, avec la certitude de celui qui sait, que je vais - contrairement \u00e0 ce qui m\u2019avait \u00e9t\u00e9 dit - pouvoir jouir du haut d\u00e9bit. Et aussit\u00f4t de d\u00e9gainer ma carte bleue. On me dit alors que je recevrai une Livebox, etc. Les jours passent, les semaines, les mois aussi d\u2019ailleurs, mais d\u2019internet haut d\u00e9bit point du tout. Bien s\u00fbr, je m\u2019enquiers aupr\u00e8s des services comp\u00e9tents. On n\u2019en sait rien, On va voir, On v\u00e9rifie, attendez, On vous rappelle, On ne sait plus, Qui vous a dit \u00e7a ? etc. Qu\u2019importe la personne \u00e0 qui j\u2019ai l\u00e2ch\u00e9 mon num\u00e9ro de carte bleue, cette personne s\u2019est \u00e9vanouie dans les limbes du d\u00e9marchage d\u2019abonnements \u00e0 internet. La seule solution consiste \u00e0 contracter un abonnement en bas d\u00e9bit. Et \u00e7a, c\u2019est l\u2019horreur. Il ne me reste plus qu\u2019\u00e0 maugr\u00e9er et \u00e0 d\u00e9plorer en un silence plein d\u2019aigreur le d\u00e9sint\u00e9r\u00eat des fournisseurs d\u2019acc\u00e8s \u00e0 internet pour les paysans isol\u00e9s que nous sommes. Enfin le haut d\u00e9bit en France m\u00e9tropolitaine \u29eb Le temps passe. Et puis un jour, j\u2019apprends que je vais avoir le haut d\u00e9bit. Je manque de d\u00e9faillir. Il y a m\u00eame une r\u00e9union \u00e0 la mairie o\u00f9 on nous explique comment cela va se passer. \u00c0 l\u2019approche des \u00e9lections (nous sommes alors \u00e0 l\u2019aube de 2007), il ne sera pas dit qu\u2019on aura laiss\u00e9 des gens sans acc\u00e8s au haut d\u00e9bit. Internet devient un droit fondamental, en passe de devenir inali\u00e9nable, il faut que les paysans que nous sommes aient internet. Le conseil g\u00e9n\u00e9ral se sort alors les doigts du... du... du porte-monnaie et met du pognon l\u00e0 o\u00f9 l\u2019op\u00e9rateur historique ne saurait le faire (merde, ce sont des paysans en nombre insuffisant quand m\u00eame). L\u00e0, je d\u00e9chante : pour la modique somme d\u2019une quarantaine d\u2019euros, on aura du 512 voire du 1 Mo. Mais il faut voir comment ! On tire une ligne classique qui parvient jusque dans l\u2019\u00e9glise. Dans la sacristie, on place un routeur et sur le fa\u00eete, \u00e0 c\u00f4t\u00e9 du coq, on met une antenne diffusant les pr\u00e9cieux kilo-octets par Wi-Fi que l\u2019on re\u00e7oit avec une antenne g\u00e9ante ! \u00c7a s\u2019appelle le Pack Surf Wi-fi. All\u00e9luia ! Comment ne pas croire en dieu ? Malheureusement, comme le disait un jour le cr\u00e9ateur du feu Nabaztag dans l\u2019\u00e9mission Plein \u00e9cran, le Wi-Fi, c\u2019est de la merde. Le moindre truc vous d\u00e9vie une onde et vous prive de votre connexion, vous savez celle que vous avez acquise \u00e0 prix d\u2019or sans les communications illimit\u00e9es, la t\u00e9l\u00e9 et tutti quanti. J\u2019oubliais ! Sans la box (bon sang ! que je d\u00e9teste ce mot) non plus. Il faut faire l\u2019acquisition d\u2019un routeur, mais j\u2019y reviendrai plus tard. L\u2019internet du pauvre pour un prix de riche \u29eb Quelle que soit la qualit\u00e9 de ma connexion, j\u2019ai le haut d\u00e9bit. Pas du 18 Mo comme \u00e0 dix kilom\u00e8tres pour un prix inf\u00e9rieur avec les communications t\u00e9l\u00e9phoniques, et tout et tout mais le haut d\u00e9bit quand m\u00eame. Nos \u00e9lus voulaient pouvoir affirmer que tout le monde a le haut d\u00e9bit, mais ils omettent de dire que tout le monde n\u2019a pas le m\u00eame haut d\u00e9bit : par Wi-Fi avec les al\u00e9as qui lui sont inh\u00e9rents ou par Satellite avec des quotas ou encore par les fils de cuivre avec les avantages que cela pr\u00e9sente, par la fibre... Apr\u00e8s un d\u00e9but tr\u00e8s difficile (\u00e7a ne marchait vraiment pas), je suis souvent amen\u00e9 \u00e0 me plaindre de d\u00e9connexions, parfois fort longues, fort ennuyantes, en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral r\u00e9gl\u00e9es plus ou moins rapidement. Raison pour quoi, je r\u00eave d\u2019avoir une connexion normale par les petits fils de cuivre de mon t\u00e9l\u00e9phone. Et enfin SFR vint \u29eb C\u2019est \u00e0 ce moment que SFR intervient. Ceux-l\u00e0, je ne les appr\u00e9cie gu\u00e8re, mais je me range \u00e0 leurs arguments. Avec eux, j\u2019aurai une connexion classique. Je souscris donc \u00e0 un abonnement chez SFR. Je re\u00e7ois les identifiants puis la \u00abbox\u00bb, et je n\u2019ai plus qu\u2019\u00e0 attendre le raccordement qui m\u2019apportera enfin la paix int\u00e9rieure. Malheureusement, en d\u00e9pit de l\u2019\u00e9ligibilit\u00e9 \u00e0 laquelle il semble que je puisse pr\u00e9tendre, je re\u00e7ois un courrier m\u2019informant que les services techniques n\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 en mesure de me satisfaire. Il faut donc que je renvoie la \u00abbox\u00bb. Pas grave. Le Wi-Fi, avec mon antenne g\u00e9ante chang\u00e9e entre-temps, me satisfait plus ou moins. Ce n\u2019est pas extraordinaire, mais \u00e7a marche. De temps \u00e0 autre, j\u2019appelle le service technique toujours pour des probl\u00e8mes de d\u00e9connexion, mais en principe cela est r\u00e9gl\u00e9 plus ou moins vite. \u00c0 condition que l\u2019inopin\u00e9e d\u00e9connexion ne se produise pas un week-end (que je ne veux pas \u00e9crire weekend). Un beau jour, je re\u00e7ois un coup de fil de... SFR : \u00abCoucou, c\u2019est nous. On a fait des travaux. Vous \u00eates \u00e9ligible et blabla, blabla\u00bb. Moi : \u00abNon merci, on m\u2019a d\u00e9j\u00e0 fait le coup. Je reste chez Orange\u00bb. SFR : \u00abSi, si. Sur mon ordinateur, etc. Et puis si je vous le dis, etc.\u00bb Bref, je d\u00e9cline. On en reste l\u00e0. Et puis un autre beau jour, non pas un beau jour, paf ! Plus de connexion. Me piquant d\u2019\u00eatre un peu geek tendance Nerd \u00e0 pulsion No-life, je bidouille. On d\u00e9branche. On ping. On change de cha\u00eene. On change m\u00eame les DNS. On v\u00e9rifie tout et tout. Mais il faut se rendre \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9vidence, force est de constater que \u00e7a ne marche plus. Rien n\u2019y fait. Et le service technique d\u2019avouer au t\u00e9l\u00e9phone son impuissance et de m\u2019annoncer la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 d\u2019une intervention technique... dans trois semaines. J\u2019en tombe de ma chaise. Je fr\u00e9mis, je br\u00fble, je bous ! Ni une ni deux, je me connecte (de mon \u00e9tablissement scolaire) et je cherche quelles solutions s\u2019offrent \u00e0 moi. Apr\u00e8s tout, du temps a pass\u00e9, peut-\u00eatre suis-je vraiment \u00e0 nouveau \u00e9ligible. Et apr\u00e8s ? \u29eb Vous connaissez l\u2019art de la temporisation ? Dans un roman, cela consiste \u00e0 diff\u00e9rer la suite de l\u2019histoire en racontant autre chose afin d\u2019impatienter le lecteur, de piquer sa curiosit\u00e9 et de le pousser - in fine - \u00e0 lire la suite.\u2028 Ce que je vais faire. Trois semaines sans internet. \u00c9videmment, dans mon coll\u00e8ge, je pouvais assouvir mes pulsions technophiles. Je n\u2019ai donc souffert que le minimum. Et puis j\u2019avais mon iPhone... C\u2019est d\u2019ailleurs \u00e0 cette p\u00e9riode que j\u2019ai lu l\u2019article sur la 4G. On y disait que les op\u00e9rateurs s\u2019engagent \u00e0 couvrir plus de 90% du territoire. Ce qu\u2019ils avaient fait pour la 3G (s\u2019engager je veux dire)... S\u2019\u00e9taient-ils engag\u00e9s \u00e0 faire de m\u00eame pour l\u2019Edge ? En tout cas, dans ma cambrousse, je n\u2019ai ni l\u2019un ni l\u2019autre. Ni Edge ni 3G. Ah si ! j\u2019ai un r\u00e9seau Edge. Un sous-r\u00e9seau, un truc ind\u00e9finissable probablement commun \u00e0 tous les op\u00e9rateurs, quelque chose d\u2019une telle lenteur que le bas d\u00e9bit fait office de r\u00eave de geek. Si si. Voir vid\u00e9o. Alors quand je re\u00e7ois un coup de fil m\u2019annon\u00e7ant avec grand fracas que les cl\u00e9s 3G c\u2019est vachement bien, je pouffe et je raccroche. Bref, c\u2019est cette maigre connexion qui me permet de patienter trois semaines. Et je vous l\u2019ai dit, je me suis demand\u00e9 que faire. Sur internet, je n\u2019ai pas trouv\u00e9 grand-chose. Orange ne permet pas de pr\u00e9tendre au haut d\u00e9bit de fa\u00e7on classique, mais SFR oui. Je m\u2019en \u00e9tonne, mais ils sont formels. Le d\u00e9sespoir suspend mes doutes, et malgr\u00e9 ma d\u00e9plorable exp\u00e9rience pass\u00e9e, je souscris. Je me dis que cette fois, c\u2019est la bonne. Alors je re\u00e7ois mes identifiants, la \u00abbox\u00bb, et je n\u2019ai plus qu\u2019\u00e0 attendre le raccordement. J\u2019ai bon espoir, je suis naturellement et beno\u00eetement confiant. J\u2019attends. Je n\u2019ai plus internet, mais j\u2019attends. Et le couperet tombe. Un courrier venant de SFR m\u2019informe que les services techniques n\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 en mesure d\u2019\u00e9tablir la connexion demand\u00e9e. Je dois donc envoyer \u00e0 nouveau leur putain de \u00abbox\u00bb. \u00c0 ce moment, je me pose quand m\u00eame une question : soit ils sont cons, et \u00e7a m\u2019\u00e9tonnerait un peu, soit ils ne sont pas cons, et \u00e7a m\u2019\u00e9tonnerait beaucoup. Ils s\u2019amuseraient \u00e0 pr\u00e9tendre des choses fausses, \u00e0 distribuer des \u00abbox\u00bb et \u00e0 se les faire renvoyer \u00e0 leur frais ? J\u2019ai des doutes... Lors de mon abonnement, on m\u2019a demand\u00e9 si je voulais basculer enti\u00e8rement chez SFR, et ne plus d\u00e9pendre en aucun cas d\u2019Orange, ce que j\u2019ai d\u00e9clin\u00e9. Si j\u2019avais accept\u00e9, je n\u2019aurais pas l\u2019ADSL, mais mes communications t\u00e9l\u00e9phoniques seraient pay\u00e9es \u00e0 SFR... Est-ce le but de la man\u0153uvre ? Nous forcerait-on un peu la main en faisant miroiter un pr\u00e9tendu abonnement internet impossible pour faire souscrire \u00e0 un nouvel abonnement t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique ? Je me pose la question... \u00c7a me semble un peu tordu comme raisonnement, mais enfin... Quoi qu\u2019il en soit, j\u2019ai eu la r\u00e9paration par Orange de ma connexion. Leur nouvelle installation n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 sans probl\u00e8me d\u2019ailleurs. Tout marchait \u00e0 nouveau, except\u00e9 que ladite installation \u00e9tait incompatible avec mon routeur Netgear. On m\u2019a conseill\u00e9 un Belkin, ce que j\u2019ai fait sans sourciller tant j\u2019\u00e9tais d\u00e9sireux de retrouver enfin une connexion. \u00c9videmment, j\u2019ai d\u00e9pens\u00e9 une quarantaine d\u2019euros pour un nouveau routeur alors que l\u2019ancien fonctionne tr\u00e8s bien, mais pas avec ma nouvelle installation. Passons.

C\u2019est d\u2019ailleurs \u00e0 cette p\u00e9riode que j\u2019ai lu l\u2019article sur la 4G. On y disait que les op\u00e9rateurs s\u2019engagent \u00e0 couvrir plus de 90% du territoire. Ce qu\u2019ils avaient fait pour la 3G (s\u2019engager je veux dire)... S\u2019\u00e9taient-ils engag\u00e9s \u00e0 faire de m\u00eame pour l\u2019Edge ?

Un sous-r\u00e9seau, un truc ind\u00e9finissable probablement commun \u00e0 tous les op\u00e9rateurs, quelque chose d\u2019une telle lenteur que le bas d\u00e9bit fait office de r\u00eave de geek. Si si. Voir vid\u00e9o. Alors quand je re\u00e7ois un coup de fil m\u2019annon\u00e7ant avec grand fracas que les cl\u00e9s 3G c\u2019est vachement bien, je pouffe et je raccroche. Bref, c\u2019est cette maigre connexion qui me permet de patienter trois semaines. Et je vous l\u2019ai dit, je me suis demand\u00e9 que faire. Sur internet, je n\u2019ai pas trouv\u00e9 grand-chose. Orange ne permet pas de pr\u00e9tendre au haut d\u00e9bit de fa\u00e7on classique, mais SFR oui. Je m\u2019en \u00e9tonne, mais ils sont formels. Le d\u00e9sespoir suspend mes doutes, et malgr\u00e9 ma d\u00e9plorable exp\u00e9rience pass\u00e9e, je souscris. Je me dis que cette fois, c\u2019est la bonne. Alors je re\u00e7ois mes identifiants, la \u00abbox\u00bb, et je n\u2019ai plus qu\u2019\u00e0 attendre le raccordement. J\u2019ai bon espoir, je suis naturellement et beno\u00eetement confiant. J\u2019attends. Je n\u2019ai plus internet, mais j\u2019attends. Et le couperet tombe. Un courrier venant de SFR m\u2019informe que les services techniques n\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 en mesure d\u2019\u00e9tablir la connexion demand\u00e9e. Je dois donc envoyer \u00e0 nouveau leur putain de \u00abbox\u00bb. \u00c0 ce moment, je me pose quand m\u00eame une question : soit ils sont cons, et \u00e7a m\u2019\u00e9tonnerait un peu, soit ils ne sont pas cons, et \u00e7a m\u2019\u00e9tonnerait beaucoup. Ils s\u2019amuseraient \u00e0 pr\u00e9tendre des choses fausses, \u00e0 distribuer des \u00abbox\u00bb et \u00e0 se les faire renvoyer \u00e0 leur frais ? J\u2019ai des doutes... Lors de mon abonnement, on m\u2019a demand\u00e9 si je voulais basculer enti\u00e8rement chez SFR, et ne plus d\u00e9pendre en aucun cas d\u2019Orange, ce que j\u2019ai d\u00e9clin\u00e9. Si j\u2019avais accept\u00e9, je n\u2019aurais pas l\u2019ADSL, mais mes communications t\u00e9l\u00e9phoniques seraient pay\u00e9es \u00e0 SFR... Est-ce le but de la man\u0153uvre ? Nous forcerait-on un peu la main en faisant miroiter un pr\u00e9tendu abonnement internet impossible pour faire souscrire \u00e0 un nouvel abonnement t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique ? Je me pose la question... \u00c7a me semble un peu tordu comme raisonnement, mais enfin... Quoi qu\u2019il en soit, j\u2019ai eu la r\u00e9paration par Orange de ma connexion. Leur nouvelle installation n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 sans probl\u00e8me d\u2019ailleurs. Tout marchait \u00e0 nouveau, except\u00e9 que ladite installation \u00e9tait incompatible avec mon routeur Netgear. On m\u2019a conseill\u00e9 un Belkin, ce que j\u2019ai fait sans sourciller tant j\u2019\u00e9tais d\u00e9sireux de retrouver enfin une connexion. \u00c9videmment, j\u2019ai d\u00e9pens\u00e9 une quarantaine d\u2019euros pour un nouveau routeur alors que l\u2019ancien fonctionne tr\u00e8s bien, mais pas avec ma nouvelle installation.

Si l\u2019on veut s\u2019opposer \u00e0 cette exclusion, il faut mettre en avant le fait que C\u00e9line est un grand \u00e9crivain, et que ses chefs-d\u2019\u0153uvre l\u2019emportent sur toute autre consid\u00e9ration. Malheureusement, il faut encore le prouver. Cette n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 montre assez, dans le meilleur des cas, la mauvaise lecture qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 faite de C\u00e9line. Dans le pire des cas, il faudra admettre que les contempteurs de C\u00e9line en parlent sans l\u2019avoir lu. En effet, trop souvent, les gens balaient d\u2019un simple revers indign\u00e9 l\u2019\u0153uvre de C\u00e9line sous le pr\u00e9texte que l\u2019auteur est antis\u00e9mite. Et de s\u2019abstenir de lire. On ne peut pas le nier. Il suffit de lire les premi\u00e8res lignes de Bagatelles pour un massacre , et l\u2019on comprendra que cet auteur est infr\u00e9quentable. En d\u2019autres termes, et pour aller vite, c\u2019est un sale con raciste. Et alors ? Quand bien m\u00eame ! Suis-je oblig\u00e9 d\u2019admirer l\u2019auteur \u2013 et d\u2019agr\u00e9er dans le m\u00eame temps toute sa biographie \u2013 pour appr\u00e9cier une \u0153uvre ? La litt\u00e9rature de Socrate \u00e0 C\u00e9line pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment n\u2019est-elle pas un vivier d\u2019individus narcissiques, n\u00e9vrotiques, drogu\u00e9s, racistes, meurtriers, j\u2019en passe et des meilleurs ? La litt\u00e9rature doit-elle d\u2019ailleurs se contenter d\u2019exprimer en un langage fleuri des sentiments d\u00e9licats qui ne choqueront personne ? Lisez ou relisez La litt\u00e9rature et le mal de Georges Bataille et vous verrez que la litt\u00e9rature ne conna\u00eet aucune limite quant au dicible et \u00e0 l\u2019indicible : elle est \u00ab comme la transgression de la loi morale, un danger. \u00c9tant inorganique, elle est irresponsable. Rien ne repose sur elle. Elle peut tout dire \u00bb. Mais qu\u2019importe, car les pamphlets de C\u00e9line \u2013 ce sont ces livres-l\u00e0 qui posent un probl\u00e8me, le reste pouvant affronter l\u2019\u00e9ternit\u00e9 sans encourir l\u2019ombre d\u2019une fl\u00e9trissure \u2013 ne sont pas de la litt\u00e9rature. Ils ne nous int\u00e9ressent pas, ils ne nous int\u00e9ressent plus, ils n\u2019int\u00e9ressaient m\u00eame plus leur auteur qui ne souhaitait pas les voir republier. Ils sont tout juste bons \u00e0 sombrer dans les oubliettes de l\u2019histoire avec la droite maurassienne et le mot n\u00e8gre si vite retir\u00e9 des nouvelles \u00e9ditions am\u00e9ricaines d\u2019 Huckleberry Finn . Il nous reste une \u0153uvre, celle-l\u00e0 m\u00eame qui est publi\u00e9e dans la pl\u00e9iade aux c\u00f4t\u00e9s de Marcel Aym\u00e9 ou de D.A.F de Sade. Et cette \u0153uvre tient du chef-d\u2019\u0153uvre. S\u2019il faut encore le prouver, on se demandera ce qu\u2019est un chef-d\u2019\u0153uvre, parce que manifestement il faut encore prouver que les livres de C\u00e9line en sont. Un chef-d\u2019\u0153uvre est une \u0153uvre qui a surv\u00e9cu aux ann\u00e9es voire aux si\u00e8cles, qui s\u2019est enrichie des lectures qui en ont \u00e9t\u00e9 faites ou m\u00eame des pol\u00e9miques. Notre lecture a charg\u00e9 l\u2019\u0153uvre d\u2019un poids qu\u2019elle n\u2019avait pas. En somme, un livre ne na\u00eet pas chef-d\u2019\u0153uvre. Il le devient, mais contient naturellement en lui tout ce qui lui fera franchir les ann\u00e9es. Un chef-d\u2019\u0153uvre est aussi un livre qui, tout en jouant avec les codes d\u2019un genre litt\u00e9raire, en est \u00e0 la fois l\u2019accomplissement et l\u2019ouverture sur un autre. Le Voyage au bout de la nuit n\u2019est-il pas tout \u00e7a ? N\u2019est-ce pas un livre qui, tout en reprenant le genre du roman picaresque, le renouvelle de fond en comble en \u00e9tant \u00e0 la fois une r\u00e9\u00e9criture de Candide de Voltaire (voir \u00e0 ce sujet le livre magnifique de Marie-Christine Bellosta C\u00e9line ou l\u2019art de la contradiction ). Si le livre est un jeu intertextuel, il n\u2019en propose pas moins une lecture de son \u00e9poque de la guerre, de la psychanalyse, de la colonisation ou du nouvel Eldorado qu\u2019est alors l\u2019Am\u00e9rique. Et ce qu\u2019il dit, il le dit dans un langage, une musique, un style comme il y en a deux par si\u00e8cle. C\u00e9line, dit-il lui-m\u00eame, publie alors le roman qu\u2019auraient d\u00fb \u00e9crire les surr\u00e9alistes. Et ce roman n\u2019en finit pas de nous parler, de nous faire parler.

Hier, j\u2019ai vu un ancien \u00e9l\u00e8ve qui est en cinqui\u00e8me \u00e0 pr\u00e9sent. \u00c0 la vie scolaire, on lui demande s\u2019il est en \u00e9tude, il r\u00e9pond le plus s\u00e9rieusement du monde : \u00ab Non, je suis en permanence \u00bb. Peut mieux faire. \u00c9coutez ceci. Une \u00e9l\u00e8ve, qu\u2019un coll\u00e8gue a envoy\u00e9e \u00e0 la vie scolaire dire quelque chose \u00e0 la CPE, revient. Ledit coll\u00e8gue lui demande si l\u2019\u00e9l\u00e8ve si elle l\u2019a vue, et r\u00e9pond : \u00ab Oui, mais elle n\u2019\u00e9tait pas l\u00e0 \u00bb ! Joli non ? Mais, il n\u2019y a pas que les \u00e9l\u00e8ves qui sont dr\u00f4les. Les parents le sont parfois aussi, mais dans un sens un peu diff\u00e9rent. Voil\u00e0. Certains parents ont un avis sur l\u2019\u00e9ducation et ne manquent pas de vous le faire savoir au moment o\u00f9 vous vous y attendez le moins. Pourtant, parfois, ils en manquent \u00e0 ce point \u2014 je veux dire d\u2019\u00e9ducation \u2014 qu\u2019ils se montrent tout \u00e0 fait discourtois. Je suppose que leurs convictions ne souffrant aucune contradiction, ils ne pensent pas une seconde qu\u2019\u00e9ventuellement, peut-\u00eatre, l\u2019\u00e9ducation, c\u2019est votre m\u00e9tier, que vous \u00eates en somme un professionnel de l\u2019\u00e9ducation. Non. En fait, tout parent a son avis sur l\u2019\u00e9ducation. Je suppose que c\u2019est tout \u00e0 fait normal. Le parent est un \u00e9ducateur. Un \u00e9ducateur qui a \u2014 en principe \u2014 d\u00e9l\u00e9gu\u00e9 sinon son r\u00f4le du moins une partie de son r\u00f4le d\u2019\u00e9ducateur \u00e0 une tierce personne. Et puis le g\u00e9niteur qui a ses id\u00e9es sur l\u2019\u00e9ducation, il est pass\u00e9 par l\u2019\u00e9cole lui aussi. Donc il sait ce que c\u2019est l\u2019\u00e9cole. Il a son avis sur la question, et, disais-je, il le vous fait parfois savoir. C\u2019est l\u00e0 un ph\u00e9nom\u00e8ne assez curieux. Jamais dans mon existence, je n\u2019ai dit \u00e0 un professionnel quel qu\u2019il soit, ce qu\u2019il devrait faire ou ce que je pense qu\u2019il devrait faire. Je n\u2019ai jamais comment\u00e9 ses choix. Imaginons. Je me vois bien d\u00e9barquer dans une boulangerie, et donner mon avis sur la confection des baguettes. Je pourrais pourtant avoir plein de choses \u00e0 dire. Au reste, il y a plein de choses que j\u2019aime faire et sur lesquelles j\u2019ai un avis : la musique, l\u2019informatique, le jardinage, la ma\u00e7onnerie, et que sais-je encore\u2026 Autre exemple. Un passager, dans un avion, quitte son si\u00e8ge, frappe \u00e0 la porte de la cabine du pilote, et commente le pilotage. Outre que c\u2019est interdit pour des raisons assez \u00e9videntes, je suis s\u00fbr que ce serait incongru si la chose \u00e9tait possible. On lui dirait : \u00ab Mais de quoi vous m\u00ealez-vous ? \u00bb Mais il en va tout autrement d\u00e8s que votre m\u00e9tier implique des enfants. Les parents vous les confient, et de facto je serais assez enclin \u00e0 trouver l\u00e9gitime que l\u2019on me demande des comptes. D\u2019ailleurs, cette situation doit concerner toutes les professions s\u2019occupant des enfants : nourrice, personnel de cr\u00e8che, p\u00e9diatre\u2026 Position d\u00e9licate que celle de cette profession. Vous \u00eates le professionnel, vous avez des dipl\u00f4mes, mais pour un instant, lors d\u2019une entrevue, d\u2019une r\u00e9union, un parent peut au motif qu\u2019il est parent contester vos d\u00e9cisions, vos choix. Pire vous mettre en porte-\u00e0-faux avec votre \u00e9l\u00e8ve. Bah oui ! C\u2019est simple \u00e0 comprendre, cher g\u00e9niteur d\u2019apprenant. L\u2019enseignant dit quelque chose, le parent en dit une autre. Que fait le gamin ? Si d\u2019aventure, il est pr\u00e9sent lors de l\u2019entrevue, l\u2019enfant peu ravi de se trouver au centre de tant d\u2019attention contradictoire, il pleure. Ne sommes-nous pas l\u00e0 pour cet enfant ? Nous agissons pour son bien. Je ne crois pas qu\u2019il existe beaucoup d\u2019enseignants sadiques, ivres de pouvoir, traumatisant avec d\u00e9lectation une jeunesse encore insouciante. Simplement, on fait notre travail. Alors on peut faire des erreurs. Mais ne peut-on en parler calmement sans condamner l\u2019autre \u00e0 l\u2019avance, en accordant \u00e0 l\u2019autre le b\u00e9n\u00e9fice du doute, sans mettre de formules p\u00e9remptoires, discourtoises sur le carnet de correspondance ou sur la copie. Vous savez ces formules de fin de non-recevoir qui coupent court \u00e0 toute conversation et vous d\u00e9nient votre propre r\u00f4le. Et vous savez quoi ? Apr\u00e8s cet acte d\u2019ing\u00e9rence dans votre m\u00e9tier, vous n\u2019insistez pas, vous laissez tomber, vous acquiescez au caprice parental, parce que ce serait prendre l\u2019enfant en otage en vous obstinant.

Plus r\u00e9cemment, les pr\u00e9cieuses ridicules du p\u00e9dagogisme ont battu en br\u00e8che le redoublement. Il n\u2019est d\u00e9sormais plus possible de faire redoubler \u00ab l\u2019apprenant \u00bb. L\u2019\u00e9l\u00e8ve en difficult\u00e9 ne peut plus saisir sa chance, et subir l\u2019humiliation douloureuse mais n\u00e9cessaire de ne pas suivre ses petits camarades partis s\u2019envoler dans les sph\u00e8res sup\u00e9rieures du savoir. Supprimer le redoublement, c\u2019est surtout une mise \u00e0 mal du pouvoir de l\u2019enseignant de dire : \u00ab Non, tu ne passeras pas \u00bb ! Le redoublement, ce mal pour un bien, ce microtraumatisme doit ramener l\u2019enfant \u00e0 la r\u00e9alit\u00e9 : \u00ab Tu n\u2019as pas travaill\u00e9, tu n\u2019as rien fait, tu ne passeras pas \u00bb. Pour quelle raison le paresseux n\u2019ayant pas fourni le travail demand\u00e9 se verrait-il garantir une injuste ascension et n\u00e9cessairement un jour limit\u00e9e par la dure r\u00e9alit\u00e9 des examens et du march\u00e9 de l\u2019emploi ? Depuis quand r\u00e9compense-t-on les enfants ayant d\u00e9m\u00e9rit\u00e9 ? En a-t-on d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu qui progressaient en passant dans la classe sup\u00e9rieure ? Et que dire de cette croyance, cet obscurantisme des temps modernes qui voit dans le num\u00e9rique la solution \u00e0 tous nos maux ? Comme si cette pr\u00e9tendue panac\u00e9e aller sauver l\u2019\u00e9cole, comme si fournir de co\u00fbteux objets technologiques \u00e0 nos enfants allait leur permettre de mieux savoir lire, \u00e9crire et compter ! L\u2019on voudrait m\u00eame que des analphab\u00e8tes n\u2019ayant jamais approch\u00e9 un livre apprennent les rudiments algorithmiques de la programmation ! Marche-t-on sur la t\u00eate au pays de l\u2019\u00c9ducation nationale ? Il faut qu\u2019au sommet de l\u2019\u00c9tat l\u2019on soit devenu fou pour brandir cette aveugle foi en la technologie, cette mode se r\u00e9inventant sempiternellement pour mieux vendre, cette fiction \u00e9ducative agit\u00e9e par les marchands du temps que sont Google et Apple, ces ogres des temps modernes venus d\u00e9vorer et nos enfants et nos imp\u00f4ts. Aujourd\u2019hui, l\u2019\u00e9cole, menac\u00e9e de la ruine, une ruine orchestr\u00e9e par des d\u00e9cennies de r\u00e9formes, est l\u2019objet d\u2019une nouvelle attaque p\u00e9dagogique : il ne s\u2019agirait rien moins que d\u2019interdire les notes. La note traumatiserait les \u00e9l\u00e8ves ! La note, ce barom\u00e8tre du niveau d\u00e9j\u00e0 bien bas, ne fournirait qu\u2019une pi\u00e8tre indication et ne proposerait aucune rem\u00e9diation ! Las ! L\u2019on veut supprimer tout instrument de mesure pour mieux cacher la maladie qui s\u2019est empar\u00e9e du syst\u00e8me scolaire. Ainsi, apr\u00e8s que la loi Haby a cr\u00e9\u00e9 des g\u00e9n\u00e9rations enti\u00e8res d\u2019illettr\u00e9s, on voudrait nous cacher les effets d\u00e9l\u00e9t\u00e8res d\u2019une \u00e9ducation \u00e0 veau l\u2019eau. Si la note stigmatise le vaurien, elle r\u00e9compense fi\u00e8rement le travail bien fait. Il est vital que notre syst\u00e8me scolaire ne soit pas un lieu o\u00f9 le plaisir se loverait comme un serpent en son nid. Il est vital que le travail, cette torture fructueuse de l\u2019esprit, fasse na\u00eetre devant l\u2019adversit\u00e9, devant la difficult\u00e9, devant l\u2019ennui (oui, l\u2019enfant doit s\u2019ennuyer, c\u2019est essentiel) heur et malheur. Eh ! croit-on tout r\u00e9ussir tout le temps partout ? Croit-on que tout le monde puisse r\u00e9ussir ? Qui voudrait d\u2019une soci\u00e9t\u00e9 o\u00f9 tout le monde r\u00e9ussit ? Cette id\u00e9ologie post-soixante-huitarde o\u00f9 il est interdit d\u2019interdire, qui pr\u00f4ne la jouissance et l\u2019absence d\u2019effort doit d\u00e9finitivement \u00eatre \u00e9radiqu\u00e9e. Ou alors la fabrique du cr\u00e9tin aura accouch\u00e9 d\u2019une nation de d\u00e9g\u00e9n\u00e9r\u00e9s\u2026 Pour cette raison, exigeons la fin du coll\u00e8ge unique, r\u00e9tablissons le redoublement et ne c\u00e9dons pas \u00e0 cet appel des Sir\u00e8nes, ce mirage de bienveillance \u00e9ducative. Nous n\u2019avons nul besoin de votre num\u00e9rique que nous laisserons au placard. Arm\u00e9s de nos seules craies, nous vous disons bien haut quelle est l\u2019\u00e9cole que nous voulons et que nous d\u00e9fendrons. Il ne sera pas dit qu\u2019un \u00e9l\u00e8ve ait pass\u00e9 une journ\u00e9e agr\u00e9able \u00e0 d\u00e9couvrir le monde qui l\u2019entoure gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 une \u00e9cole qui vivrait en harmonie avec la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 qui l\u2019anime. L\u2019\u00e9cole est un sanctuaire. L\u2019\u00e9l\u00e8ve est un moine des temps modernes, il porte un cilice de papier qui lui rappelle chaque jour qu\u2019on a rien sans rien. Et l\u2019enseignant, ce crois\u00e9 antip\u00e9dagogo, boute la comp\u00e9tence. Il refuse les \u00e9l\u00e8ves tous nuls et \u00e0 \u00e9galit\u00e9.

Appel\u00e9 \u00e9galement mort-vivant, l\u2019oxymore r\u00e9v\u00e8le, bien mieux que le mot d\u2019origine cr\u00e9ole, la contradiction insupportable que ce cousin \u00e9loign\u00e9 du d\u00e9sormais banal fant\u00f4me repr\u00e9sente. La mort est d\u00e9j\u00e0 intrins\u00e8quement bien assez traumatisante et inqui\u00e9tante (que se passe-t-il dans l\u2019au-del\u00e0 ? En principe, personne n\u2019est revenu nous le dire) pour qu\u2019elle ne s\u2019accompagne pas d\u2019un d\u00e9lai suppl\u00e9mentaire accord\u00e9 selon un go\u00fbt plut\u00f4t douteux : mort, vivant, mais pourrissant. \u00c0 ce propos, vous \u00eates vous d\u00e9j\u00e0 demand\u00e9 pourquoi on enterrait les morts ? Il y naturellement une question d\u2019hygi\u00e8ne, mais on les enfouit parce que leur vue est insupportable. Hormis le cas tr\u00e8s particulier de Blancheneige, le discours est invariablement le m\u00eame : \u00abCachez-moi ce cadavre que je ne saurais voir. Il est laid, il est d\u00e9vor\u00e9 par les vers, il pue, enterrez-le, br\u00fblez-le, faites ce que vous voulez, mais qu\u2019on me l\u2019\u00f4te de la vue\u00bb. Le zombie appara\u00eet donc. C\u2019est la premi\u00e8re chose qu\u2019il fait. Il se montre, et c\u2019est assez insupportable. D\u2019abord, il remet en question l\u2019id\u00e9e du repos m\u00e9rit\u00e9, et puis il indique assez clairement le sort qui nous attend in\u00e9luctablement. Voyez ce que vous ne voulez voir. Il y a pire. Le zombie, cet \u00eatre lent, est m\u00fb par l\u2019inassouvissable n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 de mordre. Il a faim, faim de chair fra\u00eeche. Cela ne lui suffit pas d\u2019incarner un scandale inhumain, il lui faut encore vouloir notre propre mort qui nous transformera ipso facto en mort... vivant. Ce qui n\u2019est pas mort mais qui est mort quand m\u00eame veut notre mort (etc.). Remarquez que cet Ennemi n\u2019en veut pas tant \u00e0 notre peau qu\u2019\u00e0 faire de nous son aliment. Le mort se nourrit du vivant. Ainsi le zombie repr\u00e9sente une humanit\u00e9 d\u00e9chue qui se d\u00e9vore elle-m\u00eame. Une soci\u00e9t\u00e9 qui court \u00e0 la catastrophe nourrit en son sein le zombie qui symbolise assez bien l\u2019anthropophagie mortif\u00e8re, la civilisation qui s\u2019alimente d\u2019elle-m\u00eame. En regard, l\u2019all\u00e9gorie de la mort fait pi\u00e8tre figure. Voil\u00e0 bien plus inqui\u00e9tant que la grande faucheuse ! Ce n\u2019est d\u2019ailleurs pas la moindre ironie de cette incarnation de la mort : elle est cet ennemi que l\u2019on ne peut tuer, il est d\u00e9j\u00e0 mort. Vous pouvez cependant faire quelque chose, vous pouvez atteindre la t\u00eate. On peut, en effet, se d\u00e9barrasser du zombie en visant le chef, le cerveau plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment. De ce point de vue, le zombie est cousin de ces extraterrestres au cr\u00e2ne d\u00e9mesur\u00e9. L\u2019\u00eatre venu d\u2019ailleurs est n\u00e9cessairement sup\u00e9rieurement intelligent. Et agressif ! Cependant, le zombie n\u2019est pas intelligent. Simplement, il repr\u00e9sente l\u2019individu dont les fonctions du corps, ses organes, son sang sont devenus quasi caducs. Ils ne servent \u00e0 rien. Le cerveau peut survivre \u00e0 l\u2019ablation du foie, des poumons ou du c\u0153ur. C\u2019est donc un cerveau poss\u00e9dant une seule id\u00e9e, une id\u00e9e fixe, une seule et irr\u00e9fragable id\u00e9e : bouffer du vivant. Dans la saison 1 de The walking dead, les survivants les appelaient les geeks, au sens propre, les tar\u00e9s. Il faut se demander pourquoi la fiction convoque ces tar\u00e9s monomanes repoussants. Dans la s\u00e9rie susmentionn\u00e9e, la raison est \u00e9vidente. Il y a une fascination morbide pour la civilisation d\u00e9truite. Morbide ? Paul Val\u00e9ry ne nous avait-il pas pr\u00e9venus que les civilisations \u00e9taient mortelles ? Apr\u00e8s deux guerres mondiales, c\u2019est bien le moins que puisse faire la fiction que d\u2019\u00e9vacuer nos peurs comme elle le peut. Et force est de constater que le niveau de l\u2019 \u00abentertainment\u00bb est nettement au-dessus des films catastrophes qui ont fleuri avec le passage \u00e0 l\u2019an 2000. Rien que l\u2019affiche de The Walking dead est fascinante : cette autoroute dont les voies menant \u00e0 la ville sont d\u00e9sertes, et celles en sens inverse compl\u00e8tement bouch\u00e9es par cet exode impossible qui a entass\u00e9 des foules paniqu\u00e9es devenues proies ais\u00e9es pour zombie, l\u2019implacable pourchassant que rien n\u2019arr\u00eate ou presque. Cela dit, il faut bien remarquer que la s\u00e9rie offre un autre int\u00e9r\u00eat. Le zombie \u00e9tant tr\u00e8s lent, il ne repr\u00e9sente pas un ennemi bien dangereux. Except\u00e9 quand il est en trop grand nombre, sa lenteur vous permet tr\u00e8s ais\u00e9ment d\u2019ajuster votre coup pour une d\u00e9capitation r\u00e9ussie. Mais alors quel int\u00e9r\u00eat ? Le zombie est un miroir, il montre (encore une fois) ce qui reste de l\u2019humanit\u00e9. \u00abJe cherche un homme\u00bb pourrait dire le survivant. Et, h\u00e9las ! les hommes (je veux dire ceux qui ont surv\u00e9cu) ne sont plus nombreux \u00e0 \u00eatre des hommes. Ce sont eux les monstres. \u00c9chappant \u00e0 toutes les lois de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9, et par un renversement assez fascinant, l\u2019homme devient \u00e0 son tour un monstre pourchassant les monstres, une sorte de Robert Neville. Le monstre n\u2019est pas celui que l\u2019on croit. Voil\u00e0 ce que montre la saison 2 de The Walking dead dont les protagonistes (les bons) ont trouv\u00e9 refuge dans une prison. D\u00e9sormais, de tels lieux prot\u00e8gent l\u2019honn\u00eate homme, mais en enfermant ce dernier. Avec le zombie, on a l\u2019impression de revivre une pr\u00e9histoire cauchemardesque et cannibale, une r\u00e9gression, un retour en arri\u00e8re soci\u00e9tal. World War Z donne \u00e0 lire un renversement similaire \u00e0 celui de la s\u00e9rie t\u00e9l\u00e9vis\u00e9e, mais cette fois dans la p\u00e9riode de reconstruction. Une fois l\u2019invasion zombie endigu\u00e9e (on parle d\u2019ailleurs plut\u00f4t d\u2019\u00e9pid\u00e9mie, de pand\u00e9mie, autre peur tr\u00e8s actuelle celle-l\u00e0, une variante de la grippe espagnole), l\u2019humanit\u00e9 n\u2019offre plus \u00e0 ses survivants que des individus d\u00e9nu\u00e9s d\u2019emploi, des F6 : dans l\u2019\u00e9conomie de service, lib\u00e9rale, ces gens roulaient sur l\u2019or ; une fois tout cela renvers\u00e9, ces gens ne savent rien faire. Et voil\u00e0 que le zombie nous ram\u00e8ne \u00e0 l\u2019Eccl\u00e9siaste : tout est vanit\u00e9. La vie est vaine, et on ne saura m\u00eame pas la prot\u00e9ger, explique Max Brooks. Le zombie est synonyme de d\u00e9b\u00e2cle politique. Hybris, incurie, gabegie, incomp\u00e9tence, quelle qu\u2019en soit la raison, les gouvernements du monde entier \u00e9chouent \u00e0 sauver le citoyen. Je pense qu\u2019on retrouve l\u00e0 une image tr\u00e8s am\u00e9ricaine, r\u00e9publicaine, amoureuse des origines : arme-toi, et d\u00e9brouille-toi si tu veux sauver ta peau. Le zombie est am\u00e9ricain.","title":"Petite analyse du zombie"},{"location":"%C3%89criture/Blog/Pour%20un%20manuel%20num%C3%A9rique/","tags":["Blog"],"text":"\ud83d\udd17 Lien Longtemps, j'ai pens\u00e9 que le d\u00e9bat reposant sur l'opposition hugolienne du papier et du num\u00e9rique \u00e9tait infond\u00e9. Fort de l'id\u00e9e qu'une technique ne remplace pas une autre 1 , j'avais acquis la conviction que ceci ne tuerait pas cela, que le livre tel qu'on le conna\u00eet ne serait en rien menac\u00e9 par le num\u00e9rique. De ce point de vue, chaque fois que je mets les pieds dans un salon consacr\u00e9 \u00e0 la litt\u00e9rature, en particulier de jeunesse, je me conforte dans cette id\u00e9e. Le livre sur papier, joliment reli\u00e9, avec de belles illustrations ou non, a de beaux jours devant lui. Il n'est que de constater le taux de fr\u00e9quentation de telles manifestations. En revanche, je sais maintenant que si l'ordinateur ou la tablette ne tueront pas les livres, ils tueront cependant un certain type de livre. C'est peut-\u00eatre le cas du livre de poche, c'est \u00e0 coup s\u00fbr celui du manuel scolaire. Cela pour une raison tr\u00e8s simple : si le manuel num\u00e9rique a mieux \u00e0 offrir que son jumeau de papier, alors l'esp\u00e9rance de vie de ce dernier est menac\u00e9e. Cet article ambitionne non seulement de le d\u00e9montrer, mais aussi de montrer en quoi cela est possible et souhaitable. Si le manuel devient num\u00e9rique \u29eb On le sait, le manuel est solidement implant\u00e9 dans la culture scolaire. Pas une ann\u00e9e ne commence sans la distribution de cet objet hautement commercial repr\u00e9sentant, selon un rapport de Michel Leroy , 281 millions d\u2019euros pour la seule ann\u00e9e 2010. Or le manuel tel qu\u2019on le conna\u00eet aujourd\u2019hui - celui-l\u00e0 m\u00eame dont le co\u00fbt est si \u00e9lev\u00e9 (et encore cette d\u00e9pense est-elle concurrenc\u00e9e par celle que provoque le nombre croissant des photocopies), ce manuel parfois superbement ignor\u00e9 par les enseignants somm\u00e9s de le choisir - finit in\u00e9luctablement au rebut. Ab\u00eem\u00e9, ne correspondant plus au programme, trop lourd aussi, il doit \u00eatre renouvel\u00e9, modifi\u00e9, all\u00e9g\u00e9. Sa dur\u00e9e de vie est br\u00e8ve (officiellement elle est de cinq ans environ), et les contraintes, qui ont pr\u00e9sid\u00e9 \u00e0 sa conception, nombreuses. En effet, l\u2019auteur d\u2019un manuel ne doit pas d\u00e9passer tant de pages voire tant de mots, il ob\u00e9it \u00e0 une ligne \u00e9ditoriale ou \u00e0 un programme, selon des d\u00e9lais parfois excessivement courts, etc. Or ce sont pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment ces contraintes ou ces d\u00e9fauts qui volent en \u00e9clat d\u00e8s lors que le manuel devient num\u00e9rique. Il perd son poids. Il met \u00e0 mal les limites \u00e9ditoriales. Devenu intangible, il n\u2019est plus \u00e0 jeter, il est mis \u00e0 jour. Il frappe d\u2019obsolescence ou d\u2019inanit\u00e9 la photocopie. Enfin, paradoxalement, il permet d\u2019envisager une r\u00e9duction des co\u00fbts. Mieux encore, tout se passe comme si le manuel devenant num\u00e9rique, tel un compos\u00e9 chimique, agissait comme un r\u00e9v\u00e9lateur, le r\u00e9v\u00e9lateur d\u2019une m\u00e9tamorphose scolaire. En effet, la publication du manuel num\u00e9rique \u2013 a fortiori d' un manuel libre et gratuit - pose un certain nombre de questions ou plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment remet en question un certain nombre de mod\u00e8les : un mod\u00e8le \u00e9conomique, mais aussi un mode d\u2019enseignement voire d\u2019enseignant tout court, tant il est vrai que ce r\u00f4le est plus que jamais \u00e0 red\u00e9finir. Un nouveau mod\u00e8le \u00e9conomique \u29eb Le manuel num\u00e9rique - donc immat\u00e9riel, intangible - ne s\u2019ab\u00eeme jamais, il ne s\u2019\u00e9corne pas, il ne s\u2019efface pas. L\u2019\u00e9l\u00e8ve est m\u00eame, pour la premi\u00e8re fois, invit\u00e9 \u00e0 \u00e9crire, gribouiller, souligner, surligner, annoter son manuel. \u00c9videmment d\u2019aucuns r\u00e9torqueront que si le manuel ne se d\u00e9t\u00e9riore pas, ce peut \u00eatre le cas de la machine qui le supporte. Force est cependant de constater que certaines tablettes - les iPad pour ne pas les nommer - ont une dur\u00e9e de vie largement suffisante pour accompagner les \u00e9l\u00e8ves dans leur scolarit\u00e9 (au moins au coll\u00e8ge puisque c\u2019est le niveau qui nous int\u00e9resse) 2 . Le num\u00e9rique permet, non pas l\u2019abandon d\u2019un manuel qui ne correspondrait plus au programme, mais son renouvellement, sa mise \u00e0 jour. Et il est fortement \u00e0 esp\u00e9rer que s\u2019il doit \u00eatre payant, sa mise \u00e0 jour ne saurait \u00eatre au m\u00eame prix ; qu\u2019un simple toilettage ou quelque ajout soit offert \u00e0 un prix que les collectivit\u00e9s trouveront int\u00e9ressant au point de pr\u00e9f\u00e9rer le num\u00e9rique au papier. Ainsi, c\u2019est tout un mod\u00e8le \u00e9conomique qui doit \u00eatre red\u00e9fini. Si l\u2019on consid\u00e8re que le papier, ou plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment un certain usage du papier, est amen\u00e9 \u00e0 dispara\u00eetre, on peut faire le raisonnement suivant. Certes, il faut fournir les tablettes, et cela repr\u00e9sente un co\u00fbt. Mais c\u2019est un co\u00fbt que l\u2019on doit mettre en regard des 280 millions susmentionn\u00e9s. Ce co\u00fbt ne pourrait-il s\u2019amoindrir ? D\u2019une certaine fa\u00e7on, et sans que cela ne rel\u00e8ve du domaine de l\u2019utopie, ne pourrait-il sinon dispara\u00eetre du moins diminuer drastiquement ? Dans un domaine o\u00f9 l\u2019imprimante et la photocopieuse sont reines, ne pourrait-on envisager leur abandon ? Le num\u00e9rique permet, en effet, la transmission de donn\u00e9es, de sujets, d\u2019exercices en tout genre de fa\u00e7on bien plus int\u00e9ressante que ne le fait le papier. On pourrait m\u00eame r\u00eaver ceci : aucun enseignant n\u2019aurait plus \u00e0 se ruer sur la photocopieuse encore en \u00e9tat de marche, celle devant qui deux coll\u00e8gues tr\u00e9pignent d\u00e9j\u00e0, attendant qu\u2019un l\u00e8ve-t\u00f4t (ou un retardataire comme les trois autres) ach\u00e8ve son collage pour distribuer une photocopie de qualit\u00e9 m\u00e9diocre (m\u00e9diocre parce que le num\u00e9rique a tellement mieux \u00e0 offrir) ! Songez aux images en tr\u00e8s haute d\u00e9finition. Qui peut regretter l\u2019obscure reproduction d\u2019un tableau de ma\u00eetre mal photocopi\u00e9 ? L\u2019abandon des photocopieurs permettrait de consacrer des sommes importantes aux tablettes et aux manuels pr\u00e9vus pour de tels supports. Ajoutons, pour finir, qu'un rapport de f\u00e9vrier 1986 explique que \u00able volume des d\u00e9penses consacr\u00e9es aux photocopies est \u00e9quivalent \u00e0 la dotation annuelle consacr\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019achat de manuels\u00bb (cit\u00e9 par Michel Leroy), et l'on comprendra que, dans ces conditions, l\u2019achat de tablettes n\u2019est pas le moins du monde inconsid\u00e9r\u00e9. Si, d'aventure, ces manuels sont gratuits (que l'on pense au Manuel de quatri\u00e8me ou au Livrescolaire.fr ), alors, l'argument du prix de la tablette est battu en br\u00e8che. S'ils ne sont pas gratuits, ces manuels num\u00e9riques seront de toute fa\u00e7on, para\u00eet-il, 70 % moins che rs . On peut m\u00eame pr\u00e9ciser, si l'on veut ajouter quelque argument consensuel, que c\u2019est au motif de la sant\u00e9 publique qu\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 publi\u00e9e la circulaire n\u00b0 2008-002 du 11 janvier 2008 sur le poids du cartable. On a vu r\u00e9cemment une association de kin\u00e9sith\u00e9rapeutes se saisir du probl\u00e8me. Or cela ne doit-il pas rentrer dans le calcul ? Ne doit-on pas se demander quel est l\u2019impact sur la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 sociale. Un mod\u00e8le \u00e9conomique est donc \u00e0 red\u00e9finir. Loin de grever le budget, le financement du manuel num\u00e9rique et de son support peut se faire en utilisant l\u2019argent diff\u00e9remment. Mais, on le devine, c\u2019est aussi un mod\u00e8le p\u00e9dagogique que l\u2019on doit repenser. Vers une p\u00e9dagogie diff\u00e9renci\u00e9e \u29eb Si l\u2019on se demande pourquoi utiliser un manuel num\u00e9rique, il faut \u00e9videmment se demander ce qu\u2019il apporte au regard de son \u00e9quivalent de papier. On a vu qu\u2019il \u00e9tait plus l\u00e9ger, qu\u2019il permettait de s\u2019affranchir de certaines contraintes \u00e9ditoriales, qu\u2019il \u00e9tait plus ais\u00e9ment remis au go\u00fbt du jour, etc. Est-ce tout ? Ne s\u2019agit-il que de moderniser l\u2019\u00e9cole ? Une \u00e9cole qui a un train de retard dans une soci\u00e9t\u00e9 o\u00f9 le num\u00e9rique est omnipr\u00e9sent ? Je ne le crois pas. Bien s\u00fbr, l\u2019\u00e9cole se modernise, et s\u2019est toujours modernis\u00e9e. De l\u2019apparition du tableau noir \u00e0 celle du TBI, du papier carbone au photocopieur en passant par la machine \u00e0 polycopier \u00e0 alcool, l\u2019\u00e9cole a toujours accueilli de nouvelles techniques. Hier, le magn\u00e9tophone, le magn\u00e9toscope, puis la t\u00e9l\u00e9vision, aujourd\u2019hui, l\u2019ordinateur, puis la tablette. En un sens, l'enseignant a toujours \u00e9t\u00e9 un technophile. Mais toute cette technique ne sert \u00e0 rien, ou \u00e0 pas grand-chose, si elle ne s\u2019accompagne d\u2019un changement dans la fa\u00e7on d\u2019enseigner, dans la p\u00e9dagogie. Ce seul mot suffit \u00e0 faire prendre la fuite \u00e0 des cohortes d\u2019enseignants. Pourtant, quelles que soient leurs exigences, quelle que soit leur vision de l\u2019\u00e9ducation ou de l\u2019instruction (comme on voudra), aucun ne se refusera \u00e0 reconna\u00eetre qu\u2019il est soucieux de la r\u00e9ussite de ses \u00e9l\u00e8ves, de tous ses \u00e9l\u00e8ves, pas un ne devant \u00eatre rel\u00e9gu\u00e9 au fond de la classe \u00e0 attendre que les heures passent. C\u2019est, de mon point de vue, le grand apport du num\u00e9rique. Ce n\u2019est pas un suppl\u00e9ment d\u2019\u00e2me permettant de se dire que l\u2019\u00e9cole est moderne, que l'\u00e9cole n\u2019est pas un \u00eelot ou un sanctuaire (quelle que soit la m\u00e9taphore que l\u2019on choisisse) sans rapport aucun avec la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 qui l\u2019accueille. C\u2019est un outil, un simple outil, un outil que l\u2019on peut d\u00e9brancher (est-il besoin de le rappeler \u00e0 ceux que le num\u00e9rique horripile), un outil qui doit nous permettre de mieux r\u00e9aliser notre m\u00e9tier ou alors il ne sert \u00e0 rien. Il faut se convaincre de cette id\u00e9e : une technique a une influence sur l'enseignement. Ainsi, le passage de la plume d'oie \u00e0 la plume de fer a permis d'enseigner aux enfants l'arithm\u00e9tique plus t\u00f4t, la dext\u00e9rit\u00e9 requise \u00e9tant moindre avec la plume de fer. Quelles peuvent \u00eatre, en adoptant des tablettes et des manuels num\u00e9riques, les transformations p\u00e9dagogiques ? Eh bien, si cela reste encore \u00e0 d\u00e9couvrir, je crois que l\u2019informatique permet de modifier notre p\u00e9dagogie , en la diff\u00e9renciant \u00e0 moindres frais 3 . C'est, par exemple, le cas de la dict\u00e9e. Traditionnellement, l\u2019enseignant dicte un texte et un seul \u00e0 la classe tout enti\u00e8re, laquelle s\u2019efforce de le suivre au m\u00eame rythme. Mais un manuel num\u00e9rique proposant des dict\u00e9es permet \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9l\u00e8ve de travailler \u00e0 son rythme, \u00e0 son niveau (il n\u2019est pas oblig\u00e9 de faire la m\u00eame que celle de son voisin, il n\u2019est pas oblig\u00e9 de finir en m\u00eame temps que son voisin), etc. On peut multiplier les exemples de ce type. Mieux encore, le num\u00e9rique rend poreuse la fronti\u00e8re entre l\u2019\u00e9cole et la maison. Le travail peut \u00eatre accompagn\u00e9. L'\u00e9l\u00e8ve (ou le parent aidant l'\u00e9l\u00e8ve) peut b\u00e9n\u00e9ficier d'une simple aide par mail. Ce peut \u00eatre un v\u00e9ritable travail \u00e0 distance. En effet, le num\u00e9rique permet l\u2019\u00e9criture collaborative. Un \u00e9l\u00e8ve invit\u00e9 \u00e0 r\u00e9diger un texte ne court plus le risque du hors sujet. Il n\u2019a m\u00eame plus \u00e0 se retrouver seul face \u00e0 une page qu\u2019il ne sait comment remplir, qu\u2019il peut s\u2019efforcer de remplir en t\u00e2tonnant avec maladresse. On peut corriger au fur et \u00e0 mesure en utilisant un site 4 permettant la r\u00e9daction collective d\u2019un texte. La visioconf\u00e9rence permet de suivre ou de rattraper (en y assistant \u00aben diff\u00e9r\u00e9\u00bb) un cours. C\u2019est utile pour l\u2019\u00e9l\u00e8ve qui ne peut pas se d\u00e9placer (maladie, conditions climatiques), c\u2019est utile pour l\u2019\u00e9l\u00e8ve qui veut r\u00e9\u00e9couter le cours. Et on trouvera bien d\u2019autres exemples encore ! Naturellement, ce n'est nullement la panac\u00e9e, la solution miracle, mais on aura au moins palli\u00e9 certains manques, certaines injustices, etc. Le manuel num\u00e9rique, le num\u00e9rique tout court d\u2019ailleurs, permet donc d\u2019aider tous les \u00e9l\u00e8ves et peut-\u00eatre m\u00eame de faire que le coll\u00e8ge devienne enfin unique, car il ne l\u2019a jamais \u00e9t\u00e9, n\u2019en d\u00e9plaise \u00e0 ses d\u00e9tracteurs. C\u2019est un r\u00f4le nouveau qui est d\u00e9volu \u00e0 l\u2019enseignant. On pourra penser qu\u2019il n\u2019est pas assez pay\u00e9, et l\u2019on n\u2019aura pas tort. On pourra penser que sa vie personnelle est envahie par sa vie professionnelle, et l\u2019on aura tort. Cela a toujours \u00e9t\u00e9 le cas, lorsque l\u2019on pr\u00e9pare ses cours, lorsque l\u2019on corrige ses copies. Tout au plus, les choses s\u2019accentuent-elles davantage 5 , mais ce r\u00f4le gagne en importance. En fait, apr\u00e8s avoir mis l\u2019\u00e9l\u00e8ve au centre du dispositif scolaire, l\u2019enseignant doit, \u00e0 son tour, trouver une place centrale, une place qu\u2019internet a fait \u00e9merger. Le r\u00f4le de l\u2019enseignant \u29eb Nous avons commenc\u00e9 par \u00e9voquer le co\u00fbt ph\u00e9nom\u00e9nal du manuel scolaire en France. C\u2019est un co\u00fbt qui p\u00e8se sur les collectivit\u00e9s, malgr\u00e9 qu\u2019on en ait, un co\u00fbt que l'on peut consid\u00e9rer, bien souvent, comme superf\u00e9tatoire. Ces manuels fort on\u00e9reux, d\u00e9laiss\u00e9s par les uns, port\u00e9s au pinacle par les autres, ne connaissent qu\u2019une utilisation partielle, une utilisation que ne justifie pas un tel co\u00fbt. Je ne crois pas conna\u00eetre un seul enseignant qui l\u2019utilise d\u2019un bout \u00e0 l\u2019autre, \u00e0 l\u2019exclusivit\u00e9 de toute autre ressource. La r\u00e9alit\u00e9 est que, parfois, l\u2019enseignant s\u2019appuie sur tel ou tel manuel, et recompose sa progression p\u00e9dagogique en glanant \u00e7\u00e0 et l\u00e0 diverses ressources. Ces ressources peuvent provenir des manuels qui envahissent nos casiers lors des renouvellements de programmes. Bien souvent ces ressources proviennent d\u2019internet. Que constate-t-on ? Que les enseignants b\u00e2tissent des sites internet dans lesquels ils proposent leurs propres ressources, que les enseignants r\u00e9fl\u00e9chissent \u00e0 leur pratique sur leur propre blog, \u00e9changent leurs id\u00e9es sur les r\u00e9seaux sociaux (Twitter, Facebook...), dans de nombreux forums ou listes de discussion. Ces enseignants scannent, pr\u00eatent, transmettent, diffusent leurs travaux par ces divers truchements, en cons\u00e9quence de quoi internet regorge de documents qu\u2019au prix d\u2019une adaptation l\u2019enseignant fait siens. C\u2019est une gigantesque salle des professeurs de toutes les mati\u00e8res, de tous les niveaux, de toutes les nationalit\u00e9s (si la langue le permet). Depuis l\u2019av\u00e8nement des r\u00e9seaux sociaux, je n\u2019ai jamais autant c\u00f4toy\u00e9 mes homologues belges, qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois ou marocains. D\u2019aucuns, et les \u00e9diteurs en premi\u00e8re ligne, verront ces richesses \u00e0 travers le prisme de leur profession. Ils regretteront, par exemple, que l\u2019auteur et son autorit\u00e9, disparaisse, que l\u2019\u00e9diteur ne soit plus le garant d\u2019une ligne \u00e9ditoriale. On va jusqu\u2019\u00e0 toiser cet afflux num\u00e9rique, et filant la m\u00e9taphore aquatique, le qualifiant d\u2019\u00e9gout. Ces consid\u00e9rations font de l\u2019interm\u00e9diaire entre l\u2019\u0153uvre et le lecteur une n\u00e9cessit\u00e9. Or si elle n\u2019a pas toujours exist\u00e9, elle n\u2019est pas m\u00eame seulement n\u00e9cessaire ni souhaitable. Elle n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire en ceci qu\u2019un \u00e9diteur n\u2019est le garant de rien du tout. Le march\u00e9 de l\u2019\u00e9dition pr\u00e9sente des dizaines de \u00abchefs-d\u2019\u0153uvre\u00bb \u00e0 lire chaque semaine. On voudrait nous faire croire \u00e0 la sup\u00e9riorit\u00e9 de ce flot sur celui du num\u00e9rique parce qu\u2019il a fait l\u2019objet d\u2019un tri, un tri parfois li\u00e9 \u00e0 des imp\u00e9ratifs mercantiles ? Que dire des vanity press, ces livres vendus \u00e0 compte d\u2019auteur ? des livres \u00e0 grand tirage d'une m\u00e9diocrit\u00e9 absolument inconcevable ? Ont bien \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9dit\u00e9s des livres erron\u00e9s, des horreurs de Maurras ou de C\u00e9line ! Et que dire de ces ouvrages dans lesquels on trouve coquilles et erreurs faute d'une seconde correction voire d'une relecture humaine ! Et pour le dire franchement, l\u2019\u00e9diteur n\u2019est le garant d\u2019un savoir que parce que nous lui accordons toute notre confiance. Notre savoir ne repose pas sur la validation de tel ou tel, mais sur la confiance que nous lui accordons. Ainsi nous croyons dur comme fer que la racine carr\u00e9e de 2 est 1,414\u2009213\u2009562\u2009373\u2009095\u2009048\u2009801\u2009688\u2009724\u2009209\u2009698\u2009078\u2009569\u2009671\u2009875\u2009376\u2009948\u2009073\u2009176\u2009679\u2009737\u2009990\u2009732\u2009478\u2009462\u2009107\u2009038\u2009850\u2009387\u2009534\u2009327\u2009641\u2009572\u20097. Pourquoi ? Parce que la communaut\u00e9 scientifique nous l\u2019affirme. Personnellement, c\u2019est une notion que je ne suis pas capable de battre en br\u00e8che. Je m\u2019en remets donc \u00e0 un tiers, que je trouve l'information dans un livre ou sur internet ne change rien. Elle n\u2019est pas souhaitable en ceci que l\u2019\u00e9dition ne comprend pas la mutation qui est en train de s\u2019accomplir, et qui, pourtant, s\u2019est d\u00e9j\u00e0 accomplie dans l\u2019industrie musicale. Condamn\u00e9s \u00e0 reproduire ce qui existe d\u00e9j\u00e0 ou \u00e0 dispara\u00eetre, les \u00e9diteurs s\u2019arc-boutent sur des principes battus en br\u00e8che par internet. Les droits d\u2019auteur et autres joyeuset\u00e9s (les DRM, les Time bombs, etc.) font du manuel num\u00e9rique un objet peu pratique, qui ne peut s\u2019\u00e9panouir dans de telles conditions. Pire encore ces droits paralysent l\u2019essor, la diffusion, le partage du savoir. Or toute la litt\u00e9rature du Moyen \u00c2ge s\u2019est d\u00e9velopp\u00e9e hors de ce carcan que la R\u00e9volution fran\u00e7aise, soucieuse de prot\u00e9ger les auteurs, a apport\u00e9. Lib\u00e9rant l\u2019auteur du m\u00e9c\u00e9nat, il s\u2019agissait de lui donner les moyens de vivre et donc de penser. Elle ne pouvait pr\u00e9voir qu\u2019elle se ferait confisquer ses plus belles avanc\u00e9es par la rapacit\u00e9 de ces auteurs et de leurs \u00e9diteurs lesquels confisqueraient \u00e0 leur seul profit des \u00e9crivains parfois morts depuis pr\u00e8s de 100 ans (c\u2019est le cas de Guillaume Apollinaire), quand elle ne fait pas pire... Que faire de l\u2019\u00e9diteur ? N\u2019est-il pas moribond ? Il n\u2019est plus imprimeur depuis fort longtemps (d\u00e8s le XIXe si\u00e8cle pour Louis Hachette). Certains des m\u00e9tiers li\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019impression ont disparu ou du moins partiellement disparu. C\u2019est le cas de la pr\u00e9presse, non ? Le livre devenant \u00e0 son tour immat\u00e9riel, la PAO touchant le grand public, n\u2019avons-nous pas l\u00e0 les signes d\u2019une mutation in\u00e9luctable ? Dans ces conditions, comment ne pas voir qu\u2019il p\u00e8se sur l\u2019enseignant une nouvelle responsabilit\u00e9, celui de d\u00e9terminer si telle ou telle ressource trouv\u00e9e sur internet pr\u00e9sente ou non un int\u00e9r\u00eat, si elle est fiable ou non. Si c\u2019est une responsabilit\u00e9 certaine, elle lui incombe d\u2019autant plus volontiers que du haut de ses cinq ann\u00e9es d\u2019\u00e9tudes (au minimum), l\u2019enseignant a la capacit\u00e9 de trier, de faire la part des choses dans la masse d\u2019informations que d\u00e9verse internet. Voil\u00e0 comment le lecteur devient auteur, comment il fait autorit\u00e9. C\u2019est lui qui dira si telle ou telle ressource lui semble fiable ou pas. Ayant autorit\u00e9 sur sa mati\u00e8re, r\u00e9digeant lui-m\u00eame les manuels (en France ce sont, en effet, des enseignants qui font les manuels), ayant aujourd\u2019hui la capacit\u00e9 de s\u2019autopublier, l\u2019enseignant du XXIe si\u00e8cle est un professionnel d\u2019un nouveau genre. Au tout d\u00e9but des ann\u00e9es 1880, dans le contexte des lois Ferry, on reconnaissait aux enseignants cette capacit\u00e9 de choisir leurs propres manuels. Ce n\u2019\u00e9tait plus du ressort du minist\u00e8re. Pourquoi ne pas aller plus loin \u00e0 pr\u00e9sent puisqu\u2019il a les moyens de s\u2019autopublier ? L\u2019arr\u00eat\u00e9 du 12 mai 2010 qui explicite les comp\u00e9tences \u00e0 acqu\u00e9rir par les professeurs ne va-t-il pas dans ce sens ? Il s'agit d'\u00abappr\u00e9cier la qualit\u00e9 des documents p\u00e9dagogiques (manuels scolaires num\u00e9riques ou non et livres du professeur associ\u00e9s, ressources documentaires num\u00e9riques ou non, logiciels d\u2019enseignement, etc.)\u00bb. Pour finir \u29eb Ainsi, le manuel sur papier, cet objet on\u00e9reux et pr\u00e9caire, en bute \u00e0 l\u2019essor d\u2019internet, conna\u00eet une v\u00e9ritable crise. Cette crise, me semble-t-il, redistribuera les r\u00f4les et modifiera notre fa\u00e7on d'enseigner. Quant au manuel num\u00e9rique, fort de tous ses avantages en terme de poids, d'interactivit\u00e9 et de richesse en tout genre, il devrait prendre, \u00e0 plus ou moins longue \u00e9ch\u00e9ance place dans les cartables des \u00e9l\u00e8ves. Souhaitons que cela se fasse rapidement. On ne fera cependant pas l'\u00e9conomie d'une v\u00e9ritable r\u00e9flexion sur ce que doit \u00eatre ce manuel. Lyonel Kaufmann, reprenant ce billet , a esquiss\u00e9 tr\u00e8s r\u00e9cemment quelques pistes . Une question doit se poser \u00e9galement. Quelle entreprise emportera la mise ? Google, Microsoft, Apple ont bien compris qu'il y avait l\u00e0 un march\u00e9 6 \u00e0 prendre. Je ne vais pas ergoter sur un tel sujet qui exc\u00e9derait de loin l'objet de cet article, mais, enfin, il faudra bien prendre en compte ceci : l'\u00e9l\u00e9gance, la facilit\u00e9 d'usage, l'ouverture et la fiabilit\u00e9 sont les qualit\u00e9s indispensables requises pour convaincre et les pouvoirs publics et les \u00e9l\u00e8ves (sans oublier leurs parents) et leurs enseignants. Je ne sais vraiment pas qui, de Google, Microsoft ou Apple, poss\u00e8de la totalit\u00e9 de ces qualit\u00e9s. 1 Internet n'a pas tu\u00e9 la t\u00e9l\u00e9vision qui n'a pas tu\u00e9 la radio qui n'a pas tu\u00e9 la presse... 2 Sans tomber dans l\u2019asservissement ou l\u2019aveuglement publicitaire, force est de reconna\u00eetre que l\u2019iPad rel\u00e8gue dans les limbes toutes les autres machines \u00e0 commencer part les ultraportables faits de plastiques et dont la fiabilit\u00e9 laisse \u00e0 d\u00e9sirer. Que je sache, l\u2019iPad n\u2019a pas de panne, est solide et son autonomie n\u2019oblige pas les collectivit\u00e9s \u00e0 modifier les salles de cours pour que tous les \u00e9l\u00e8ves puissent se brancher sur le secteur. 3 \u00c0 moindres frais parce que, sans l'informatique, diff\u00e9rencier la p\u00e9dagogie peut se r\u00e9v\u00e9ler complexe. 4 Etherpad par exemple. 5 Et encore ! Je pr\u00e9f\u00e8re prendre le temps de r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 un \u00e9l\u00e8ve par mail plut\u00f4t que de d\u00e9couvrir, le lendemain, que tel exercice n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 fait, qu'il n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 compris. 6 On peut regretter que l'\u00e9cole soit un march\u00e9, mais c'est le cas. C'est d'ailleurs l'\u00e9dition scolaire qui, voulant \u00e9largir ce march\u00e9, l'a compris fort t\u00f4t en cr\u00e9ant le cahier de vacances. En effet, en 1933, paraissait Loulou et Babette .","title":"Pour un manuel num\u00e9rique"},{"location":"%C3%89criture/Blog/Pour%20un%20manuel%20num%C3%A9rique/#si-le-manuel-devient-numerique","text":"On le sait, le manuel est solidement implant\u00e9 dans la culture scolaire. Pas une ann\u00e9e ne commence sans la distribution de cet objet hautement commercial repr\u00e9sentant, selon un rapport de Michel Leroy , 281 millions d\u2019euros pour la seule ann\u00e9e 2010. Or le manuel tel qu\u2019on le conna\u00eet aujourd\u2019hui - celui-l\u00e0 m\u00eame dont le co\u00fbt est si \u00e9lev\u00e9 (et encore cette d\u00e9pense est-elle concurrenc\u00e9e par celle que provoque le nombre croissant des photocopies), ce manuel parfois superbement ignor\u00e9 par les enseignants somm\u00e9s de le choisir - finit in\u00e9luctablement au rebut. Ab\u00eem\u00e9, ne correspondant plus au programme, trop lourd aussi, il doit \u00eatre renouvel\u00e9, modifi\u00e9, all\u00e9g\u00e9. Sa dur\u00e9e de vie est br\u00e8ve (officiellement elle est de cinq ans environ), et les contraintes, qui ont pr\u00e9sid\u00e9 \u00e0 sa conception, nombreuses. En effet, l\u2019auteur d\u2019un manuel ne doit pas d\u00e9passer tant de pages voire tant de mots, il ob\u00e9it \u00e0 une ligne \u00e9ditoriale ou \u00e0 un programme, selon des d\u00e9lais parfois excessivement courts, etc. Or ce sont pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment ces contraintes ou ces d\u00e9fauts qui volent en \u00e9clat d\u00e8s lors que le manuel devient num\u00e9rique. Il perd son poids. Il met \u00e0 mal les limites \u00e9ditoriales. Devenu intangible, il n\u2019est plus \u00e0 jeter, il est mis \u00e0 jour. Il frappe d\u2019obsolescence ou d\u2019inanit\u00e9 la photocopie. Enfin, paradoxalement, il permet d\u2019envisager une r\u00e9duction des co\u00fbts. Mieux encore, tout se passe comme si le manuel devenant num\u00e9rique, tel un compos\u00e9 chimique, agissait comme un r\u00e9v\u00e9lateur, le r\u00e9v\u00e9lateur d\u2019une m\u00e9tamorphose scolaire. En effet, la publication du manuel num\u00e9rique \u2013 a fortiori d' un manuel libre et gratuit - pose un certain nombre de questions ou plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment remet en question un certain nombre de mod\u00e8les : un mod\u00e8le \u00e9conomique, mais aussi un mode d\u2019enseignement voire d\u2019enseignant tout court, tant il est vrai que ce r\u00f4le est plus que jamais \u00e0 red\u00e9finir.","title":"Si le manuel devient num\u00e9rique"},{"location":"%C3%89criture/Blog/Pour%20un%20manuel%20num%C3%A9rique/#un-nouveau-modele-economique","text":"Le manuel num\u00e9rique - donc immat\u00e9riel, intangible - ne s\u2019ab\u00eeme jamais, il ne s\u2019\u00e9corne pas, il ne s\u2019efface pas. L\u2019\u00e9l\u00e8ve est m\u00eame, pour la premi\u00e8re fois, invit\u00e9 \u00e0 \u00e9crire, gribouiller, souligner, surligner, annoter son manuel. \u00c9videmment d\u2019aucuns r\u00e9torqueront que si le manuel ne se d\u00e9t\u00e9riore pas, ce peut \u00eatre le cas de la machine qui le supporte. Force est cependant de constater que certaines tablettes - les iPad pour ne pas les nommer - ont une dur\u00e9e de vie largement suffisante pour accompagner les \u00e9l\u00e8ves dans leur scolarit\u00e9 (au moins au coll\u00e8ge puisque c\u2019est le niveau qui nous int\u00e9resse) 2 . Le num\u00e9rique permet, non pas l\u2019abandon d\u2019un manuel qui ne correspondrait plus au programme, mais son renouvellement, sa mise \u00e0 jour. Et il est fortement \u00e0 esp\u00e9rer que s\u2019il doit \u00eatre payant, sa mise \u00e0 jour ne saurait \u00eatre au m\u00eame prix ; qu\u2019un simple toilettage ou quelque ajout soit offert \u00e0 un prix que les collectivit\u00e9s trouveront int\u00e9ressant au point de pr\u00e9f\u00e9rer le num\u00e9rique au papier. Ainsi, c\u2019est tout un mod\u00e8le \u00e9conomique qui doit \u00eatre red\u00e9fini. Si l\u2019on consid\u00e8re que le papier, ou plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment un certain usage du papier, est amen\u00e9 \u00e0 dispara\u00eetre, on peut faire le raisonnement suivant. Certes, il faut fournir les tablettes, et cela repr\u00e9sente un co\u00fbt. Mais c\u2019est un co\u00fbt que l\u2019on doit mettre en regard des 280 millions susmentionn\u00e9s. Ce co\u00fbt ne pourrait-il s\u2019amoindrir ? D\u2019une certaine fa\u00e7on, et sans que cela ne rel\u00e8ve du domaine de l\u2019utopie, ne pourrait-il sinon dispara\u00eetre du moins diminuer drastiquement ? Dans un domaine o\u00f9 l\u2019imprimante et la photocopieuse sont reines, ne pourrait-on envisager leur abandon ? Le num\u00e9rique permet, en effet, la transmission de donn\u00e9es, de sujets, d\u2019exercices en tout genre de fa\u00e7on bien plus int\u00e9ressante que ne le fait le papier. On pourrait m\u00eame r\u00eaver ceci : aucun enseignant n\u2019aurait plus \u00e0 se ruer sur la photocopieuse encore en \u00e9tat de marche, celle devant qui deux coll\u00e8gues tr\u00e9pignent d\u00e9j\u00e0, attendant qu\u2019un l\u00e8ve-t\u00f4t (ou un retardataire comme les trois autres) ach\u00e8ve son collage pour distribuer une photocopie de qualit\u00e9 m\u00e9diocre (m\u00e9diocre parce que le num\u00e9rique a tellement mieux \u00e0 offrir) ! Songez aux images en tr\u00e8s haute d\u00e9finition. Qui peut regretter l\u2019obscure reproduction d\u2019un tableau de ma\u00eetre mal photocopi\u00e9 ? L\u2019abandon des photocopieurs permettrait de consacrer des sommes importantes aux tablettes et aux manuels pr\u00e9vus pour de tels supports. Ajoutons, pour finir, qu'un rapport de f\u00e9vrier 1986 explique que \u00able volume des d\u00e9penses consacr\u00e9es aux photocopies est \u00e9quivalent \u00e0 la dotation annuelle consacr\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019achat de manuels\u00bb (cit\u00e9 par Michel Leroy), et l'on comprendra que, dans ces conditions, l\u2019achat de tablettes n\u2019est pas le moins du monde inconsid\u00e9r\u00e9. Si, d'aventure, ces manuels sont gratuits (que l'on pense au Manuel de quatri\u00e8me ou au Livrescolaire.fr ), alors, l'argument du prix de la tablette est battu en br\u00e8che. S'ils ne sont pas gratuits, ces manuels num\u00e9riques seront de toute fa\u00e7on, para\u00eet-il, 70 % moins che rs . On peut m\u00eame pr\u00e9ciser, si l'on veut ajouter quelque argument consensuel, que c\u2019est au motif de la sant\u00e9 publique qu\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 publi\u00e9e la circulaire n\u00b0 2008-002 du 11 janvier 2008 sur le poids du cartable. On a vu r\u00e9cemment une association de kin\u00e9sith\u00e9rapeutes se saisir du probl\u00e8me. Or cela ne doit-il pas rentrer dans le calcul ? Ne doit-on pas se demander quel est l\u2019impact sur la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 sociale. Un mod\u00e8le \u00e9conomique est donc \u00e0 red\u00e9finir. Loin de grever le budget, le financement du manuel num\u00e9rique et de son support peut se faire en utilisant l\u2019argent diff\u00e9remment. Mais, on le devine, c\u2019est aussi un mod\u00e8le p\u00e9dagogique que l\u2019on doit repenser.","title":"Un nouveau mod\u00e8le \u00e9conomique"},{"location":"%C3%89criture/Blog/Pour%20un%20manuel%20num%C3%A9rique/#vers-une-pedagogie-differenciee","text":"Si l\u2019on se demande pourquoi utiliser un manuel num\u00e9rique, il faut \u00e9videmment se demander ce qu\u2019il apporte au regard de son \u00e9quivalent de papier. On a vu qu\u2019il \u00e9tait plus l\u00e9ger, qu\u2019il permettait de s\u2019affranchir de certaines contraintes \u00e9ditoriales, qu\u2019il \u00e9tait plus ais\u00e9ment remis au go\u00fbt du jour, etc. Est-ce tout ? Ne s\u2019agit-il que de moderniser l\u2019\u00e9cole ? Une \u00e9cole qui a un train de retard dans une soci\u00e9t\u00e9 o\u00f9 le num\u00e9rique est omnipr\u00e9sent ? Je ne le crois pas. Bien s\u00fbr, l\u2019\u00e9cole se modernise, et s\u2019est toujours modernis\u00e9e. De l\u2019apparition du tableau noir \u00e0 celle du TBI, du papier carbone au photocopieur en passant par la machine \u00e0 polycopier \u00e0 alcool, l\u2019\u00e9cole a toujours accueilli de nouvelles techniques. Hier, le magn\u00e9tophone, le magn\u00e9toscope, puis la t\u00e9l\u00e9vision, aujourd\u2019hui, l\u2019ordinateur, puis la tablette. En un sens, l'enseignant a toujours \u00e9t\u00e9 un technophile. Mais toute cette technique ne sert \u00e0 rien, ou \u00e0 pas grand-chose, si elle ne s\u2019accompagne d\u2019un changement dans la fa\u00e7on d\u2019enseigner, dans la p\u00e9dagogie. Ce seul mot suffit \u00e0 faire prendre la fuite \u00e0 des cohortes d\u2019enseignants. Pourtant, quelles que soient leurs exigences, quelle que soit leur vision de l\u2019\u00e9ducation ou de l\u2019instruction (comme on voudra), aucun ne se refusera \u00e0 reconna\u00eetre qu\u2019il est soucieux de la r\u00e9ussite de ses \u00e9l\u00e8ves, de tous ses \u00e9l\u00e8ves, pas un ne devant \u00eatre rel\u00e9gu\u00e9 au fond de la classe \u00e0 attendre que les heures passent. C\u2019est, de mon point de vue, le grand apport du num\u00e9rique. Ce n\u2019est pas un suppl\u00e9ment d\u2019\u00e2me permettant de se dire que l\u2019\u00e9cole est moderne, que l'\u00e9cole n\u2019est pas un \u00eelot ou un sanctuaire (quelle que soit la m\u00e9taphore que l\u2019on choisisse) sans rapport aucun avec la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 qui l\u2019accueille. C\u2019est un outil, un simple outil, un outil que l\u2019on peut d\u00e9brancher (est-il besoin de le rappeler \u00e0 ceux que le num\u00e9rique horripile), un outil qui doit nous permettre de mieux r\u00e9aliser notre m\u00e9tier ou alors il ne sert \u00e0 rien. Il faut se convaincre de cette id\u00e9e : une technique a une influence sur l'enseignement. Ainsi, le passage de la plume d'oie \u00e0 la plume de fer a permis d'enseigner aux enfants l'arithm\u00e9tique plus t\u00f4t, la dext\u00e9rit\u00e9 requise \u00e9tant moindre avec la plume de fer. Quelles peuvent \u00eatre, en adoptant des tablettes et des manuels num\u00e9riques, les transformations p\u00e9dagogiques ? Eh bien, si cela reste encore \u00e0 d\u00e9couvrir, je crois que l\u2019informatique permet de modifier notre p\u00e9dagogie , en la diff\u00e9renciant \u00e0 moindres frais 3 . C'est, par exemple, le cas de la dict\u00e9e. Traditionnellement, l\u2019enseignant dicte un texte et un seul \u00e0 la classe tout enti\u00e8re, laquelle s\u2019efforce de le suivre au m\u00eame rythme. Mais un manuel num\u00e9rique proposant des dict\u00e9es permet \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9l\u00e8ve de travailler \u00e0 son rythme, \u00e0 son niveau (il n\u2019est pas oblig\u00e9 de faire la m\u00eame que celle de son voisin, il n\u2019est pas oblig\u00e9 de finir en m\u00eame temps que son voisin), etc. On peut multiplier les exemples de ce type. Mieux encore, le num\u00e9rique rend poreuse la fronti\u00e8re entre l\u2019\u00e9cole et la maison. Le travail peut \u00eatre accompagn\u00e9. L'\u00e9l\u00e8ve (ou le parent aidant l'\u00e9l\u00e8ve) peut b\u00e9n\u00e9ficier d'une simple aide par mail. Ce peut \u00eatre un v\u00e9ritable travail \u00e0 distance. En effet, le num\u00e9rique permet l\u2019\u00e9criture collaborative. Un \u00e9l\u00e8ve invit\u00e9 \u00e0 r\u00e9diger un texte ne court plus le risque du hors sujet. Il n\u2019a m\u00eame plus \u00e0 se retrouver seul face \u00e0 une page qu\u2019il ne sait comment remplir, qu\u2019il peut s\u2019efforcer de remplir en t\u00e2tonnant avec maladresse. On peut corriger au fur et \u00e0 mesure en utilisant un site 4 permettant la r\u00e9daction collective d\u2019un texte. La visioconf\u00e9rence permet de suivre ou de rattraper (en y assistant \u00aben diff\u00e9r\u00e9\u00bb) un cours. C\u2019est utile pour l\u2019\u00e9l\u00e8ve qui ne peut pas se d\u00e9placer (maladie, conditions climatiques), c\u2019est utile pour l\u2019\u00e9l\u00e8ve qui veut r\u00e9\u00e9couter le cours. Et on trouvera bien d\u2019autres exemples encore ! Naturellement, ce n'est nullement la panac\u00e9e, la solution miracle, mais on aura au moins palli\u00e9 certains manques, certaines injustices, etc. Le manuel num\u00e9rique, le num\u00e9rique tout court d\u2019ailleurs, permet donc d\u2019aider tous les \u00e9l\u00e8ves et peut-\u00eatre m\u00eame de faire que le coll\u00e8ge devienne enfin unique, car il ne l\u2019a jamais \u00e9t\u00e9, n\u2019en d\u00e9plaise \u00e0 ses d\u00e9tracteurs. C\u2019est un r\u00f4le nouveau qui est d\u00e9volu \u00e0 l\u2019enseignant. On pourra penser qu\u2019il n\u2019est pas assez pay\u00e9, et l\u2019on n\u2019aura pas tort. On pourra penser que sa vie personnelle est envahie par sa vie professionnelle, et l\u2019on aura tort. Cela a toujours \u00e9t\u00e9 le cas, lorsque l\u2019on pr\u00e9pare ses cours, lorsque l\u2019on corrige ses copies. Tout au plus, les choses s\u2019accentuent-elles davantage 5 , mais ce r\u00f4le gagne en importance. En fait, apr\u00e8s avoir mis l\u2019\u00e9l\u00e8ve au centre du dispositif scolaire, l\u2019enseignant doit, \u00e0 son tour, trouver une place centrale, une place qu\u2019internet a fait \u00e9merger.","title":"Vers une p\u00e9dagogie diff\u00e9renci\u00e9e"},{"location":"%C3%89criture/Blog/Pour%20un%20manuel%20num%C3%A9rique/#le-role-de-lenseignant","text":"Nous avons commenc\u00e9 par \u00e9voquer le co\u00fbt ph\u00e9nom\u00e9nal du manuel scolaire en France. C\u2019est un co\u00fbt qui p\u00e8se sur les collectivit\u00e9s, malgr\u00e9 qu\u2019on en ait, un co\u00fbt que l'on peut consid\u00e9rer, bien souvent, comme superf\u00e9tatoire. Ces manuels fort on\u00e9reux, d\u00e9laiss\u00e9s par les uns, port\u00e9s au pinacle par les autres, ne connaissent qu\u2019une utilisation partielle, une utilisation que ne justifie pas un tel co\u00fbt. Je ne crois pas conna\u00eetre un seul enseignant qui l\u2019utilise d\u2019un bout \u00e0 l\u2019autre, \u00e0 l\u2019exclusivit\u00e9 de toute autre ressource. La r\u00e9alit\u00e9 est que, parfois, l\u2019enseignant s\u2019appuie sur tel ou tel manuel, et recompose sa progression p\u00e9dagogique en glanant \u00e7\u00e0 et l\u00e0 diverses ressources. Ces ressources peuvent provenir des manuels qui envahissent nos casiers lors des renouvellements de programmes. Bien souvent ces ressources proviennent d\u2019internet. Que constate-t-on ? Que les enseignants b\u00e2tissent des sites internet dans lesquels ils proposent leurs propres ressources, que les enseignants r\u00e9fl\u00e9chissent \u00e0 leur pratique sur leur propre blog, \u00e9changent leurs id\u00e9es sur les r\u00e9seaux sociaux (Twitter, Facebook...), dans de nombreux forums ou listes de discussion. Ces enseignants scannent, pr\u00eatent, transmettent, diffusent leurs travaux par ces divers truchements, en cons\u00e9quence de quoi internet regorge de documents qu\u2019au prix d\u2019une adaptation l\u2019enseignant fait siens. C\u2019est une gigantesque salle des professeurs de toutes les mati\u00e8res, de tous les niveaux, de toutes les nationalit\u00e9s (si la langue le permet). Depuis l\u2019av\u00e8nement des r\u00e9seaux sociaux, je n\u2019ai jamais autant c\u00f4toy\u00e9 mes homologues belges, qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois ou marocains. D\u2019aucuns, et les \u00e9diteurs en premi\u00e8re ligne, verront ces richesses \u00e0 travers le prisme de leur profession. Ils regretteront, par exemple, que l\u2019auteur et son autorit\u00e9, disparaisse, que l\u2019\u00e9diteur ne soit plus le garant d\u2019une ligne \u00e9ditoriale. On va jusqu\u2019\u00e0 toiser cet afflux num\u00e9rique, et filant la m\u00e9taphore aquatique, le qualifiant d\u2019\u00e9gout. Ces consid\u00e9rations font de l\u2019interm\u00e9diaire entre l\u2019\u0153uvre et le lecteur une n\u00e9cessit\u00e9. Or si elle n\u2019a pas toujours exist\u00e9, elle n\u2019est pas m\u00eame seulement n\u00e9cessaire ni souhaitable. Elle n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire en ceci qu\u2019un \u00e9diteur n\u2019est le garant de rien du tout. Le march\u00e9 de l\u2019\u00e9dition pr\u00e9sente des dizaines de \u00abchefs-d\u2019\u0153uvre\u00bb \u00e0 lire chaque semaine. On voudrait nous faire croire \u00e0 la sup\u00e9riorit\u00e9 de ce flot sur celui du num\u00e9rique parce qu\u2019il a fait l\u2019objet d\u2019un tri, un tri parfois li\u00e9 \u00e0 des imp\u00e9ratifs mercantiles ? Que dire des vanity press, ces livres vendus \u00e0 compte d\u2019auteur ? des livres \u00e0 grand tirage d'une m\u00e9diocrit\u00e9 absolument inconcevable ? Ont bien \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9dit\u00e9s des livres erron\u00e9s, des horreurs de Maurras ou de C\u00e9line ! Et que dire de ces ouvrages dans lesquels on trouve coquilles et erreurs faute d'une seconde correction voire d'une relecture humaine ! Et pour le dire franchement, l\u2019\u00e9diteur n\u2019est le garant d\u2019un savoir que parce que nous lui accordons toute notre confiance. Notre savoir ne repose pas sur la validation de tel ou tel, mais sur la confiance que nous lui accordons. Ainsi nous croyons dur comme fer que la racine carr\u00e9e de 2 est 1,414\u2009213\u2009562\u2009373\u2009095\u2009048\u2009801\u2009688\u2009724\u2009209\u2009698\u2009078\u2009569\u2009671\u2009875\u2009376\u2009948\u2009073\u2009176\u2009679\u2009737\u2009990\u2009732\u2009478\u2009462\u2009107\u2009038\u2009850\u2009387\u2009534\u2009327\u2009641\u2009572\u20097. Pourquoi ? Parce que la communaut\u00e9 scientifique nous l\u2019affirme. Personnellement, c\u2019est une notion que je ne suis pas capable de battre en br\u00e8che. Je m\u2019en remets donc \u00e0 un tiers, que je trouve l'information dans un livre ou sur internet ne change rien. Elle n\u2019est pas souhaitable en ceci que l\u2019\u00e9dition ne comprend pas la mutation qui est en train de s\u2019accomplir, et qui, pourtant, s\u2019est d\u00e9j\u00e0 accomplie dans l\u2019industrie musicale. Condamn\u00e9s \u00e0 reproduire ce qui existe d\u00e9j\u00e0 ou \u00e0 dispara\u00eetre, les \u00e9diteurs s\u2019arc-boutent sur des principes battus en br\u00e8che par internet. Les droits d\u2019auteur et autres joyeuset\u00e9s (les DRM, les Time bombs, etc.) font du manuel num\u00e9rique un objet peu pratique, qui ne peut s\u2019\u00e9panouir dans de telles conditions. Pire encore ces droits paralysent l\u2019essor, la diffusion, le partage du savoir. Or toute la litt\u00e9rature du Moyen \u00c2ge s\u2019est d\u00e9velopp\u00e9e hors de ce carcan que la R\u00e9volution fran\u00e7aise, soucieuse de prot\u00e9ger les auteurs, a apport\u00e9. Lib\u00e9rant l\u2019auteur du m\u00e9c\u00e9nat, il s\u2019agissait de lui donner les moyens de vivre et donc de penser. Elle ne pouvait pr\u00e9voir qu\u2019elle se ferait confisquer ses plus belles avanc\u00e9es par la rapacit\u00e9 de ces auteurs et de leurs \u00e9diteurs lesquels confisqueraient \u00e0 leur seul profit des \u00e9crivains parfois morts depuis pr\u00e8s de 100 ans (c\u2019est le cas de Guillaume Apollinaire), quand elle ne fait pas pire... Que faire de l\u2019\u00e9diteur ? N\u2019est-il pas moribond ? Il n\u2019est plus imprimeur depuis fort longtemps (d\u00e8s le XIXe si\u00e8cle pour Louis Hachette). Certains des m\u00e9tiers li\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019impression ont disparu ou du moins partiellement disparu. C\u2019est le cas de la pr\u00e9presse, non ? Le livre devenant \u00e0 son tour immat\u00e9riel, la PAO touchant le grand public, n\u2019avons-nous pas l\u00e0 les signes d\u2019une mutation in\u00e9luctable ? Dans ces conditions, comment ne pas voir qu\u2019il p\u00e8se sur l\u2019enseignant une nouvelle responsabilit\u00e9, celui de d\u00e9terminer si telle ou telle ressource trouv\u00e9e sur internet pr\u00e9sente ou non un int\u00e9r\u00eat, si elle est fiable ou non. Si c\u2019est une responsabilit\u00e9 certaine, elle lui incombe d\u2019autant plus volontiers que du haut de ses cinq ann\u00e9es d\u2019\u00e9tudes (au minimum), l\u2019enseignant a la capacit\u00e9 de trier, de faire la part des choses dans la masse d\u2019informations que d\u00e9verse internet. Voil\u00e0 comment le lecteur devient auteur, comment il fait autorit\u00e9. C\u2019est lui qui dira si telle ou telle ressource lui semble fiable ou pas. Ayant autorit\u00e9 sur sa mati\u00e8re, r\u00e9digeant lui-m\u00eame les manuels (en France ce sont, en effet, des enseignants qui font les manuels), ayant aujourd\u2019hui la capacit\u00e9 de s\u2019autopublier, l\u2019enseignant du XXIe si\u00e8cle est un professionnel d\u2019un nouveau genre. Au tout d\u00e9but des ann\u00e9es 1880, dans le contexte des lois Ferry, on reconnaissait aux enseignants cette capacit\u00e9 de choisir leurs propres manuels. Ce n\u2019\u00e9tait plus du ressort du minist\u00e8re. Pourquoi ne pas aller plus loin \u00e0 pr\u00e9sent puisqu\u2019il a les moyens de s\u2019autopublier ? L\u2019arr\u00eat\u00e9 du 12 mai 2010 qui explicite les comp\u00e9tences \u00e0 acqu\u00e9rir par les professeurs ne va-t-il pas dans ce sens ? Il s'agit d'\u00abappr\u00e9cier la qualit\u00e9 des documents p\u00e9dagogiques (manuels scolaires num\u00e9riques ou non et livres du professeur associ\u00e9s, ressources documentaires num\u00e9riques ou non, logiciels d\u2019enseignement, etc.)\u00bb.","title":"Le r\u00f4le de l\u2019enseignant"},{"location":"%C3%89criture/Blog/Pour%20un%20manuel%20num%C3%A9rique/#pour-finir","text":"Ainsi, le manuel sur papier, cet objet on\u00e9reux et pr\u00e9caire, en bute \u00e0 l\u2019essor d\u2019internet, conna\u00eet une v\u00e9ritable crise. Cette crise, me semble-t-il, redistribuera les r\u00f4les et modifiera notre fa\u00e7on d'enseigner. Quant au manuel num\u00e9rique, fort de tous ses avantages en terme de poids, d'interactivit\u00e9 et de richesse en tout genre, il devrait prendre, \u00e0 plus ou moins longue \u00e9ch\u00e9ance place dans les cartables des \u00e9l\u00e8ves. Souhaitons que cela se fasse rapidement. On ne fera cependant pas l'\u00e9conomie d'une v\u00e9ritable r\u00e9flexion sur ce que doit \u00eatre ce manuel. Lyonel Kaufmann, reprenant ce billet , a esquiss\u00e9 tr\u00e8s r\u00e9cemment quelques pistes . Une question doit se poser \u00e9galement. Quelle entreprise emportera la mise ? Google, Microsoft, Apple ont bien compris qu'il y avait l\u00e0 un march\u00e9 6 \u00e0 prendre. Je ne vais pas ergoter sur un tel sujet qui exc\u00e9derait de loin l'objet de cet article, mais, enfin, il faudra bien prendre en compte ceci : l'\u00e9l\u00e9gance, la facilit\u00e9 d'usage, l'ouverture et la fiabilit\u00e9 sont les qualit\u00e9s indispensables requises pour convaincre et les pouvoirs publics et les \u00e9l\u00e8ves (sans oublier leurs parents) et leurs enseignants. Je ne sais vraiment pas qui, de Google, Microsoft ou Apple, poss\u00e8de la totalit\u00e9 de ces qualit\u00e9s. 1 Internet n'a pas tu\u00e9 la t\u00e9l\u00e9vision qui n'a pas tu\u00e9 la radio qui n'a pas tu\u00e9 la presse... 2 Sans tomber dans l\u2019asservissement ou l\u2019aveuglement publicitaire, force est de reconna\u00eetre que l\u2019iPad rel\u00e8gue dans les limbes toutes les autres machines \u00e0 commencer part les ultraportables faits de plastiques et dont la fiabilit\u00e9 laisse \u00e0 d\u00e9sirer. Que je sache, l\u2019iPad n\u2019a pas de panne, est solide et son autonomie n\u2019oblige pas les collectivit\u00e9s \u00e0 modifier les salles de cours pour que tous les \u00e9l\u00e8ves puissent se brancher sur le secteur. 3 \u00c0 moindres frais parce que, sans l'informatique, diff\u00e9rencier la p\u00e9dagogie peut se r\u00e9v\u00e9ler complexe. 4 Etherpad par exemple. 5 Et encore !

C'est d'ailleurs l'\u00e9dition scolaire qui, voulant \u00e9largir ce march\u00e9, l'a compris fort t\u00f4t en cr\u00e9ant le cahier de vacances.

En moins bien. Ce ne serait qu\u2019un \u00e9cran forc\u00e9ment nuisible (aux yeux, \u00e0 la concentration, \u00e0 l\u2019intelligence) encastr\u00e9 dans un m\u00e9prisable \u00e9crin de plastique. Les tenants du 1er ont le sentiment d\u2019avoir tout dit quand ils d\u00e9clarent leur amour pour le papier. Et les 2nd sont renvoy\u00e9s \u00e0 la froideur de leur appareil d\u2019o\u00f9 serait absent le plaisir de tourner les pages, d\u2019avoir un poids dans la main et puis on ne sait trop quoi d\u2019ind\u00e9finissable qui ferait autorit\u00e9 du fond des \u00e2ges. Peut-\u00eatre l\u2019industrie du livre num\u00e9rique est-elle responsable de cet \u00e9tat de fait ? En popularisant le livre num\u00e9rique, on a voulu que celui-ci soit une r\u00e9plique du livre papier. Et en effet, avec certaines applications, on peut tourner des pages, ce qui n\u2019a aucun sens, mais cela rappelle le bon livre papier. \u00c7a r\u00e9conforte. C\u2019\u00e9tait la mode du skeuomorphisme. Cela dit, il \u00e9tait absolument n\u00e9cessaire que l\u2019on retrouve ce \u00e0 quoi on \u00e9tait habitu\u00e9. De plus, il \u00e9tait inconcevable que le livre num\u00e9rique ne soit pas en mesure d\u2019apporter du haut de sa superbe technologique tout ce que le papier pouvait apporter. Il fallait donc que l\u2019on puisse souligner. Cela va de soi. Il fallait aussi que l\u2019on puisse gribouiller quelque chose dans la marge ou m\u00eame placer un marque-page. Mais le num\u00e9rique ne pouvait se contenter de singer son illustre pr\u00e9d\u00e9cesseur. Il fallait qu\u2019il fasse mieux, m\u00eame pour ce que l\u2019on \u00e9tait accoutum\u00e9 \u00e0 faire depuis des ann\u00e9es. Le livre num\u00e9rique se devait d\u2019am\u00e9liorer significativement l\u2019exp\u00e9rience de la lecture. C\u2019est ce que permet une Kindle. D\u00e9finir \u29eb Si l\u2019on tapote sur un mot, on peut faire appara\u00eetre sa d\u00e9finition gr\u00e2ce au dictionnaire int\u00e9gr\u00e9. On n\u2019a pas besoin d\u2019interrompre sa lecture pour prendre un dictionnaire. De plus, le dictionnaire peut \u00eatre multilingues. Si vous lisez en anglais ou en chinois, votre dictionnaire sera en anglais ou en chinois. On peut m\u00eame choisir d\u2019enregistrer le vocabulaire recherch\u00e9 dans le dictionnaire. On trouve alors dans sa biblioth\u00e8que un nouveau livre contenant les mots ayant fait l\u2019objet d\u2019une recherche. C\u2019est tr\u00e8s pratique pour r\u00e9viser, une fois la lecture termin\u00e9e. Deux autres possibilit\u00e9s accompagnent l\u2019irruption du dictionnaire : l\u2019acc\u00e8s \u00e0 Wikip\u00e9dia et \u00e0 la traduction. L\u2019encyclop\u00e9die vient id\u00e9alement compl\u00e9ter les informations transmises par le dictionnaire et si celui-ci ne vous permet pas de comprendre la d\u00e9finition dans la langue d\u2019origine d\u2019un mot de vocabulaire inconnu, alors le traducteur se chargera de vous y aider. La Kindle est donc \u00e0 elle seule une incitation \u00e0 lire dans une langue \u00e9trang\u00e8re. Par exemple, l\u2019option Word Wise favorise l\u2019apprentissage de la langue dans laquelle vous lisez. Elle permet d\u2019afficher des d\u00e9finitions au-dessus des mots, dans l\u2019interligne, en filigrane en somme. Ainsi, on ne lit pas vraiment un seul livre \u00e0 la fois mais plusieurs. En fait, de nombreuses fois, il m\u2019est arriv\u00e9 d\u2019\u00eatre \u00e9tonn\u00e9 par un mot de l\u2019auteur ou de ressentir le besoin de v\u00e9rifier la validit\u00e9 d\u2019une information et je le faisais en utilisant le navigateur int\u00e9gr\u00e9 menant \u00e0 Wikip\u00e9dia. On peut donc effectuer des recherches assez facilement et rapidement. On n\u2019ira pas surfer sur le web et s\u2019\u00e9loigner de sa lecture, le navigateur int\u00e9gr\u00e9 ne le permettant pas. Il est donc assez facile de rester concentr\u00e9 sur sa liseuse (contrairement aux tablettes). Chercher \u29eb Cette fonction est symbolis\u00e9e par une petite loupe. C\u2019est un peu l\u2019\u00e9quivalent du crtl / cmd + f dans une page web ou un document longs comme le bras. Elle permet de trouver instantan\u00e9ment ce que l\u2019on recherche. C\u2019est l\u2019une des fonctions que j\u2019utilise le plus. Gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 elle, je retrouve quasi instantan\u00e9ment un passage qui m\u2019a plu mais que je n\u2019avais pas not\u00e9. Et surtout, cette recherche est toujours couronn\u00e9e de succ\u00e8s. En cherchant sur un livre papier, vous pouvez passer assez facilement \u00e0 c\u00f4t\u00e9 du passage recherch\u00e9. La machine, non. De ce point de vue, elle est infaillible. On trouvera, gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 cette fonction, toutes les occurrences d\u2019un mot \u00e0 travers le livre. On peut donc le parcourir sous l\u2019angle de tel ou tel mot recherch\u00e9. X-Ray \u29eb Cette fonction est typiquement de celle qui aurait chang\u00e9 ma vie d\u2019\u00e9tudiant. Comme l\u2019indique Amazon : \u00ab La fonction X-Ray permet d\u2019explorer la structure d\u2019un livre sur le Kindle Touch, ses id\u00e9es essentielles, les personnages ou les th\u00e8mes. \u00bb Par exemple, cela vous permet d\u2019acc\u00e9der \u00e0 tous les emplacements o\u00f9 le personnage untel appara\u00eet. L\u2019ensemble des personnages peut alors \u00eatre affich\u00e9 par ordre alphab\u00e9tique mais aussi par ordre d\u2019apparition ou encore par ordre de pertinence. De m\u00eame avec les principaux th\u00e8mes du livre, ce qui facilite les r\u00e9visions en vue d\u2019un examen ou un concours. Malheureusement cette fonction ne se trouve pas dans tous les livres, et de surcro\u00eet elle ne se trouve que dans les livres \u00e9crits en anglais. Souligner \u29eb Ou surligner ! Nulle h\u00e9sitation \u00e0 avoir puisque l\u2019on pourra effacer toute trace de son passage. On peut tout effacer ensuite. On vous propose m\u00eame d\u2019user de diff\u00e9rentes couleurs. L\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat ? Vous surlignez tel passage en jaune. Ce sera le vocabulaire. En vert ? Ce sera vos citations pr\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9es. En bleu ? Les passage qu\u2019il vous semble bon de discuter, etc. Surligner La multiplicit\u00e9 des couleurs offre une option int\u00e9ressante d\u2019exploitation en classe, une fois la tablette ou la liseuse branch\u00e9e sur un vid\u00e9oprojecteur. C\u2019est int\u00e9ressant de faire appara\u00eetre diff\u00e9rents champs lexicaux au cours d\u2019une lecture analytique. On peut aussi acc\u00e9der aux passages les plus surlign\u00e9s non par vous mais par les autres lecteurs. Certains n\u2019aiment pas. Pour ma part, je trouve \u00e7a assez amusant. Ainsi, au cours de votre lecture, vous voyez que tel passage a \u00e9t\u00e9 soulign\u00e9 tant de fois. C\u2019est int\u00e9ressant, car il m\u2019est arriv\u00e9 de relire deux fois un passage que d\u2019autres avaient soulign\u00e9. Un passage auquel je n\u2019avais tout d\u2019abord pas pr\u00eat\u00e9 attention mais que, constatant que le passage avait \u00e9t\u00e9 soulign\u00e9, faisait l\u2019objet d\u2019une relecture. Je me disais que peut-\u00eatre, je n\u2019avais pas \u00e9t\u00e9 assez attentif. Et de reprendre le passage en question. Ce passage soulign\u00e9 agit comme un r\u00e9v\u00e9lateur : Attention ! Passage potentiellement m\u00e9morable ! Annoter \u29eb Annoter un livre peut avoir un double int\u00e9r\u00eat. En tant qu\u2019enseignant, je prends des notes en vue d\u2019une r\u00e9utilisation en classe de tel ou tel passage. J\u2019ai rep\u00e9r\u00e9 une belle ellipse ou un bel exemple de narration omnisciente, un passage qui m\u00e9riterait d\u2019\u00eatre \u00e9tudi\u00e9 dans le cadre d\u2019une s\u00e9quence, alors je l\u2019\u00e9cris dans une note afin de m\u2019en souvenir ult\u00e9rieurement mais aussi en vue de retrouver plus facilement le passage en question.

Cela aura donc pris moins d\u2019une semaine ! All\u00e9luia ! Ce deuxi\u00e8me chapitre est consacr\u00e9 \u00e0 la Gen\u00e8se, au tout d\u00e9but de la Gen\u00e8se. On commence avec la cr\u00e9ation du monde pour terminer avec la tour de Babel. Naturellement, \u00e7a a \u00e9t\u00e9 difficile de faire des choix \u2013 un v\u00e9ritable cr\u00e8ve-c\u0153ur \u2013 parce qu\u2019avec la Bible, on pourrait imaginer des milliers de chapitres diff\u00e9rents. Si l\u2019on n\u2019avait des contraintes de temps ou de programme, j\u2019aurais volontiers suivi la trame narrative du film de John Huston . Cela m\u2019aurait permis d\u2019\u00e9voquer Abraham et diff\u00e9rentes histoires comme celle de Sodome et Gomorrhe. De mani\u00e8re g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, je voulais, un peu \u00e0 la mani\u00e8re de Victor Hugo , pr\u00e9senter la Bible comme un fabuleux recueil d\u2019histoires, de contes, de l\u00e9gendes, etc., montrer des temps imm\u00e9moriaux o\u00f9 l\u2019homme vivait en compagnie de Dieu avant d\u2019\u00eatre chass\u00e9 de l\u2019\u00c9den, un temps o\u00f9 l\u2019homme vivait des centaines d\u2019ann\u00e9es, un temps o\u00f9 l\u2019on pouvait rencontrer des g\u00e9ants \u2013 les N\u00e9philim \u2013 les hommes forts du temps jadis (pour dire la v\u00e9rit\u00e9, je les ai oubli\u00e9s ceux-l\u00e0). De toute fa\u00e7on, je pense publier \u00e0 l\u2019avenir des variantes du chapitre II. Ce seront des chapitres bis. Je pourrais alors en consacrer un \u00e0 L\u2019Exode , par exemple. Le chapitre II n\u2019est donc pas termin\u00e9, et ne le sera jamais, un peu comme les lettres permutant de la Torah . Reste que je suis vraiment tr\u00e8s heureux de poursuivre la publication de ce manuel de sixi\u00e8me, lequel, contrairement \u00e0 celui de quatri\u00e8me , voit le jour chapitre apr\u00e8s chapitre, progressivement, au fur et \u00e0 mesure de mes envies, de mes d\u00e9couvertes. Et plus j\u2019avance dans ce travail, plus j\u2019en arrive \u00e0 la conclusion que le num\u00e9rique nous permet d\u2019acc\u00e9der \u00e0 la beaut\u00e9 des choses. J\u2019en veux pour preuve ce tableau de Brueghel, La tour de Babel , que l\u2019on peut t\u00e9l\u00e9charger, pour peu qu\u2019une image de 200 Mo ne vous fasse pas peur. Et m\u00eame si iBooks Author ne vous permet pas d\u2019afficher une image d\u2019une telle r\u00e9solution, 5000 pixels par 5000 pixels, sur un iPad, c\u2019est d\u00e9j\u00e0 tr\u00e8s beau ! Il me reste \u00e0 vous souhaiter une bonne lecture. Pendant ce temps-l\u00e0, j\u2019irai poursuivre ce manuel, qui se poursuivra par la guerre de Troie. Ce sera le chapitre trois (oui, je sais, le jeu de mots est pitoyable).

En revanche, je vous laisse d\u00e9couvrir ce premier chapitre de ce nouveau manuel toujours libre, toujours gratuit. Vous pouvez le t\u00e9l\u00e9charger sur iTunes , sur iTunes U , en PDF ou m\u00eame retrouver la plupart de son contenu sur Ralentir travaux . Bonne lecture.","title":"Publication du premier chapitre"},{"location":"%C3%89criture/Blog/Qui%20fera%20la%20part%20du%20feu%20%3F/","tags":["Blog"],"text":"\ud83d\udd17 Lien En \u00e9crivant cet article sur C\u00e9line, j\u2019ai voulu montrer qu\u2019il \u00e9tait n\u00e9cessaire de montrer (oui, je sais\u2026) que C\u00e9line \u00e9tait un grand \u00e9crivain, et qu\u2019\u00e0 ce titre, il \u00e9tait digne d\u2019\u00eatre c\u00e9l\u00e9br\u00e9, sans que la r\u00e9publique n\u2019encour\u00fbt quelque regrettable fl\u00e9trissure. Dans le m\u00eame temps, j\u2019ai lu \u00e7\u00e0 et l\u00e0 que C\u00e9line \u00e9tait un immense auteur, mais aussi un sale type, ce qui m\u2019a pos\u00e9 deux probl\u00e8mes. D\u2019une part, il n\u2019\u00e9tait plus n\u00e9cessaire de faire la d\u00e9monstration du g\u00e9nie litt\u00e9raire de C\u00e9line alors que j\u2019ai pourtant souvent lu qu\u2019on lui d\u00e9niait cette qualit\u00e9 ; d\u2019autre part, il fallait faire un sort \u00e0 cette accusation biographique r\u00e9duisant la vie d\u2019un homme \u00e0 ces deux mots : sale type. Tout d\u2019abord, l\u2019\u0153uvre. Si elle est g\u00e9niale, point besoin d\u2019ergoter. Il faut la c\u00e9l\u00e9brer en tant que telle. Encore faut-il distinguer l\u2019\u0153uvre litt\u00e9raire des pamphlets qui sont, eux, absolument illisibles, infects, et n\u2019ont pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment aucun int\u00e9r\u00eat litt\u00e9raire. Ensuite, l\u2019homme. ll faudrait tout d\u2019abord faire la d\u00e9monstration que C\u00e9line est un sale type, ce qui n\u2019est, \u00e0 mon avis, pas si \u00e9vident. Et avant m\u00eame de se demander si l\u2019auteur de Mort \u00e0 cr\u00e9dit est un sale con, je voudrais qu\u2019on se demande si, avant de lire un livre, on cherche \u00e0 savoir si l\u2019auteur est un type bien ou non. Prenons un exemple concret. Ronsard est-il un con ? Pass\u00e9e l'incongruit\u00e9 de la question, vous vous pr\u00eaterez comme je l\u2019ai fait \u00e0 l\u2019exercice, et vous en chercherez un t\u00e9moignage. Dont acte. Je cite, c\u2019est dans Les Amours : Je n'aime point les Juifs, ils ont mis en la croix Ce Christ, ce Messias qui nos pechez efface, Des Prophetes occis ensanglant\u00e9s la place, Murmur\u00e9 contre Dieu qui leur donna les loix. Fils de Vespasian, grand Tite tu devois, Destruisant leur Cit\u00e9, en d\u00e9truire la race, Sans leur donner ny temps, ny moment ny espace De chercher autre part autres divers endroits. Jamais Leon Hebrieu des Juifs n'est pris naissance, Leon Hebrieu, qui donne aux Dames cognoissance D\u2019un amour fabuleux, la m\u00eame fiction : Faux trompeur, mensonger, plein de fraudes et d\u2019astuce Je crois qu\u2019en luy coupant la peau de son prepuce On luy coupa le c\u0153ur et toute affection. \u00c0 lire un tel sonnet, je ne pense pas qu\u2019on puisse c\u00e9l\u00e9brer les cinq cents ans de la mort du po\u00e8te en 2085, l\u2019antis\u00e9mitisme \u00e9tant trop \u00e9vident. \u00c9videmment, je n\u2019ignore pas qu\u2019entre Ronsard et C\u00e9line, il y a une diff\u00e9rence de taille : le premier n\u2019appelle pas au meurtre (encore que le deuxi\u00e8me quatrain ne me para\u00eet pas innocent). Mais enfin, consid\u00e9rera-t-on un jour que les \u0153uvres du pass\u00e9 sont entach\u00e9es du poids du pass\u00e9, un pass\u00e9 insupportable, mais un pass\u00e9 qu\u2019on ne peut refouler, car c\u2019est ce que veut Serge Klarsfeld ; un pass\u00e9 qu\u2019on ne peut censurer (c\u2019est le cas de Tintin au Congo) ; un pass\u00e9 qu\u2019on ne peut r\u00e9\u00e9crire (c\u2019est le cas d\u2019Huckleberry Finn) ; un pass\u00e9 qu\u2019on ne peut ignorer, comme c\u2019est le cas de Jules Verne pour lequel je n\u2019entends nul reproche, et je finirai sur ce sinistre exemple plein d\u2019un racisme ais\u00e9ment circonscriptible \u00e0 une \u00e9poque donn\u00e9e extrait de L\u2019\u00cele myst\u00e9rieuse : Le personnage de Nab est un \u00ab N\u00e8gre \u00bb (P. 16). Il est d'une fid\u00e9lit\u00e9 canine \u00e0 toute \u00e9preuve (la m\u00e9taphore est plus que sugg\u00e9r\u00e9e tout au long du roman) : \u00ab Quand Nab apprit que son ma\u00eetre [Cyrus Smith] avait \u00e9t\u00e9 fait prisonnier, il quitta le Massachusetts sans h\u00e9siter, arriva devant Richmond, et, apr\u00e8s avoir risqu\u00e9 vingt fois sa vie, il parvint \u00e0 p\u00e9n\u00e9trer dans la ville assi\u00e9g\u00e9e \u00bb (P. 16), ou encore, croyant que son ma\u00eetre \u00e9tait mort, il refuse toute nourriture : \u00ab Priv\u00e9 de son ma\u00eetre, il ne voulait plus vivre ! \u00bb (P. 32). Quand les rescap\u00e9s adoptent un singe pour le domestiquer, le serviteur r\u00e9agit en ces termes : \u00ab - Ainsi, dit Nab, c'est s\u00e9rieux, mon ma\u00eetre ? Nous allons le prendre comme domestique ? - Oui, Nab, r\u00e9pondit en souriant l'ing\u00e9nieur. Mais ne sois pas jaloux ! \u00bb (p. 135) Que conclure ? La r\u00e9ponse est difficile, mais je suis persuad\u00e9 qu\u2019on ne peut pas se d\u00e9barrasser de la question comme on le fait aujourd\u2019hui avec C\u00e9line. La seule question digne aujourd'hui d'\u00eatre pos\u00e9e est la suivante : l'\u00e9crivain qui a \u00e9crit ces horreurs sur les Juifs a-t-il pu \u00e9crire quelques-unes des plus belles pages de la litt\u00e9rature ?","title":"Qui fera la part du feu ?"},{"location":"%C3%89criture/Blog/Qu%E2%80%99est-ce%20que%20lire%20au%20XXIe%20si%C3%A8cle%20%3F/","text":"\ud83d\udd17 Publi\u00e9 par Yann Houry 2 f\u00e9vrier 2016 9 commentaires sur Qu\u2019est-ce que lire au XXIe si\u00e8cle ? On sait que pour beaucoup de gens le d\u00e9bat sur la lecture s\u2019articule autour de cette question : livre num\u00e9rique ou livre papier ? Pour ma part, reprenant la formule de Victor Hugo, j\u2019affirme que ceci ne tuera pas cela . Les deux coexistent et l\u2019on voit mal pourquoi une nouveaut\u00e9 (le livre num\u00e9rique) aurait pour corollaire la disparition de l\u2019ancien (le livre papier). Dans le cas contraire, on doit avoir une conception assez radicale de la culture\u2026 On a vu qu\u2019internet n\u2019avait pas tu\u00e9 la t\u00e9l\u00e9 qui n\u2019avait pas tu\u00e9 la radio qui n\u2019avait pas tu\u00e9 la presse\u2026 Il en va de m\u00eame de tout un tas de choses. Par exemple, la voiture, le train ou l\u2019avion n\u2019ont jamais d\u00e9truit les autres moyens de transport que sont la marche ou le v\u00e9lo. Et on comprend bien pourquoi et je ne vous ferai donc pas l\u2019insulte d\u2019une explication. Il en va de m\u00eame des livres parce que, outre des consid\u00e9rations purement subjectives qu\u2019on ne saurait s\u2019interdire de prendre en compte, de nouveaux modes de lecture peuvent n\u2019avoir pas plus d\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat, dans certaines situations, que prendre l\u2019avion pour aller chercher son pain dans la ruelle d\u2019\u00e0 c\u00f4t\u00e9. Mais, dans certains cas pr\u00e9cis, le num\u00e9rique permet un mode de lecture nouveau que ne permettait pas le papier . C\u2019est ce petit tour d\u2019horizon que je vous propose. Cependant, je n\u2019\u00e9voquerai pas tout ce qui peut entourer et parfois \u00e9touffer le texte, \u00e0 commencer par l\u2019image qui peut m\u00eame devenir anim\u00e9e ou interactive, la vid\u00e9o, l\u2019audio, les quiz, etc. Non, en fait, ce qui m\u2019int\u00e9resse ici, c\u2019est bien l\u2019acte de lire en lui-m\u00eame et surtout pas la d\u00e9bauche de moyens techniques qui vous \u00e9loigne du mot. iBooks \u29eb Ma premi\u00e8re exp\u00e9rience num\u00e9rique de la lecture (j\u2019entends par l\u00e0 celle d\u2019un vrai livre) fut iBooks sur iPad. Je n\u2019ai donc pas grand-chose d\u2019un pr\u00e9curseur. Longtemps, mon horizon num\u00e9rique a eu pour borne la litt\u00e9rature puisque l\u2019acc\u00e8s \u00e0 celle-ci \u00e9tait toujours cantonn\u00e9 au seul papier. En fait, je n\u2019aimais pas lire sur l\u2019\u00e9cran de mon iPad. Le r\u00e9tro\u00e9clairage devait \u00eatre le coupable. Cependant, j\u2019\u00e9tais assez fascin\u00e9 par les possibilit\u00e9s induites par le livre num\u00e9rique. Surligner \u29eb La premi\u00e8re chose qui m\u2019a plu \u00e9tait de pouvoir surligner le livre sans avoir \u00e0 \u00e9prouver une once de culpabilit\u00e9 \u00e0 ainsi barbouiller l\u2019ouvrage puisque je pouvais ensuite tout effacer. La multiplicit\u00e9 des couleurs offre une option int\u00e9ressante d\u2019exploitation en classe, une fois l\u2019iPad branch\u00e9 sur un vid\u00e9oprojecteur. Noter \u29eb Plus personnelle est la possibilit\u00e9 de prendre des notes dans la marge. Annoter un livre (de m\u00eame que mettre un marque-page) n\u2019est donc pas l\u2019apanage du papier. L\u00e0 aussi, je trouve qu\u2019une exploitation scolaire de la note pourrait \u00eatre envisag\u00e9e : l\u2019\u00e9l\u00e8ve peut r\u00e9pondre aux questions du manuel directement sur le livre. Il peut m\u00eame envoyer ses r\u00e9ponses \u00e0 l\u2019enseignant. Partager \u29eb Les fonctions de partage permettent \u00e9galement de diffuser mais \u00e0 plus vaste \u00e9chelle puisque l\u2019on peut, par exemple, tweeter un passage qui vous a s\u00e9duit. Il est aussi possible d\u2019archiver tel ou tel passage dans son application pr\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9e de prise de notes. Encore que pour ma part, je fais des captures d\u2019\u00e9cran des passages qui m\u2019ont int\u00e9ress\u00e9. Et comme une application comme Evernote (OCR oblige) est capable de chercher du texte dans une image, cela ne pose aucun probl\u00e8me \u00e0 cette m\u00e9thode d\u2019archivage qui s\u2019est impos\u00e9e \u00e0 moi je ne sais trop comment. Peut-\u00eatre parce que certains livres prot\u00e9g\u00e9s par des DRM ne facilitent pas vraiment l\u2019option de partage. Tout comme celle du copier/coller parfois purement et simplement d\u00e9sactiv\u00e9e. Cette ablation technique me fait en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral consid\u00e9rer que le piratage est pr\u00e9f\u00e9rable \u00e0 la l\u00e9galit\u00e9 qui ne vous permet pas de faire des choses tr\u00e8s simples comme copier un extrait que je voudrais par exemple donner \u00e0 mes \u00e9l\u00e8ves. Heureusement il existe plusieurs solutions comme les OCR. Le dictionnaire int\u00e9gr\u00e9 \u29eb N\u2019\u00e9tait-ce la limitation aux dictionnaires int\u00e9gr\u00e9s au syst\u00e8me, cet acc\u00e8s tient du g\u00e9nie. A-t-on jamais d\u00e9plor\u00e9 d\u2019avoir \u00e0 quitter l\u2019ouvrage lu pour chercher un mot dans le dictionnaire ? Ici, tapoter sur un mot fait appara\u00eetre une sorte de petit pop-up contenant le sens du mot. Une int\u00e9gration du Robert, d\u2019Antidote ou du TLFi me comblerait de bonheur. Ce qui est amusant, c\u2019est que le dictionnaire s\u2019adapte \u00e0 chaque langue. Vous lisez en Anglais ? Le dictionnaire sera anglais. Vous lisez en Allemand ? Le dictionnaire sera allemand. Et la m\u00eame chose en Grec, Italien, Japonais, etc. J\u2019utilise aussi cette fonctionnalit\u00e9 pour chercher un peu tout et n\u2019importe quoi, en tout cas quelque chose qui ne sera pas dans le dictionnaire. En ce cas, notre petit pop-up me proposera de \u00ab Rechercher sur le web \u00bb et j\u2019acc\u00e8derai \u00e0 une requ\u00eate Google d\u00e9j\u00e0 toute pr\u00eate. Prononcer \u29eb Cette fonction doit tout d\u2019abord \u00eatre activ\u00e9e dans les R\u00e9glages (> G\u00e9n\u00e9ral > Accessibilit\u00e9 > Parole > \u00c9noncer la s\u00e9lection). Elle permet de faire lire le texte \u00e0 voix haute par le syst\u00e8me. C\u2019est une fonction qui s\u2019adresse aux personnes dont la vue ne permet pas de bien lire le texte m\u00eame en agrandissant la police (possibilit\u00e9 que je n\u2019ai pas m\u00eame \u00e9voqu\u00e9e tant nous y sommes dor\u00e9navant accoutum\u00e9s). \u00c9videmment nous pouvons avoir des \u00e9l\u00e8ves qui ont ce handicap. On peut \u00eatre confront\u00e9 aussi \u00e0 des \u00e9l\u00e8ves rencontrant des difficult\u00e9s de lecture et qui suivront d\u2019autant mieux la lecture que les mots automatiquement lus sont \u00e9galement surlign\u00e9s. Mais je recours moi-m\u00eame \u00e0 cette fonction d\u00e8s lors que je lis un texte en anglais et que je veux m\u2019assurer de la prononciation de tel ou tel mot. De plus, il est vraiment amusant de constater qu\u2019un livre devient litt\u00e9ralement audible. Bien s\u00fbr, cela n\u2019a rien \u00e0 voir avec l\u2019audiobook ; \u00e7a n\u2019a rien de commun avec les beaux enregistrements que de bons lecteurs, acteurs et m\u00eame auteurs ont fait de tel ou tel chef-d\u2019oeuvre, mais disons que \u00e7a d\u00e9panne. La recherche \u29eb Cette fonction m\u2019a litt\u00e9ralement transport\u00e9 de bonheur quand je l\u2019ai d\u00e9couverte. Un peu comme le crtl / cmd + f dans une page web ou un document long comme le bras. S\u00e9lectionnez un mot, tapotez sur Rechercher et vous avez toutes les occurrences du mot dans le livre. C\u2019est magique ! En fait, j\u2019utilise le plus souvent cette fonction en tapotant sur la loupe en haut \u00e0 droite. Essayez et voyez comme il est ais\u00e9 de retrouver un passage qui vous int\u00e9ressait et dont vous aviez oubli\u00e9 l\u2019emplacement ! D\u2019autres applications de lecture \u29eb Vous vous souvenez que je vous disais avoir peu go\u00fbt\u00e9 au plaisir de la lecture sur iPad avec iBooks ? C\u2019\u00e9tait en raison de l\u2019\u00e9clairage qui m\u2019agressait fortement les yeux et, la nuit, c\u2019\u00e9tait bien pire, m\u00eame quand la luminosit\u00e9 \u00e9tait au minimum. Et ce n\u2019\u00e9tait pas le mode nuit qui m\u2019apportait un soulagement parce que l\u2019id\u00e9e m\u00eame de lire un texte blanc sur fond noir me paraissait farfelue. Google Play Livres \u29eb En revanche, j\u2019ai beaucoup appr\u00e9ci\u00e9 le r\u00e9glage de la luminosit\u00e9, laquelle baissait automatiquement en fonction de l\u2019heure. Et cette baisse s\u2019accompagnait d\u2019une diminution de la lumi\u00e8re bleue au profit de tons plus chauds, tirant sur le jaune. Cela occasionnait moins de fatigue oculaire. L\u2019une des applications le permettant est Play Livres , l\u2019app de Google. Mais avec l\u2019introduction d\u2019iOS 9.3 et la g\u00e9n\u00e9ralisation de ce r\u00e9glage \u00e0 l\u2019ensemble du syst\u00e8me, on peut profiter de cette fonction partout. Je l\u2019ai m\u00eame adopt\u00e9e sur mon Mac avec flu.x . Une autre fonction assez amusante de Play Livres est l\u2019option de traduction. Celle-ci s\u2019av\u00e8re assez efficace. Quoi qu\u2019il en soit, les deux apps (Google Play et iBooks) offrent des fonctions assez similaires et ne vous obligent \u00e0 choisir entre elles que si vous optez pour l\u2019un ou l\u2019autre des magasins (je n\u2019ose dire librairie) que proposent les deux concurrents. Kindle \u29eb J\u2019ai trouv\u00e9 dans la concurrence une autre application : Kindle d\u2019Amazon. Mais avant de vous donner les raisons assez \u00e9videntes de mon utilisation de cette application, il faut vous dire un mot de ma liseuse, que j\u2019ai adopt\u00e9e assez tard. La Kindle \u29eb C\u2019est en effet avec la liseuse que je suis devenu un lecteur num\u00e9rique. Moi qui croyais que la liseuse \u00e9tait une anomalie dans un march\u00e9 largement occup\u00e9 par les tablettes ! Un appareil un peu surann\u00e9 dont le premier mod\u00e8le \u00e9tait apparu\u2026 en 2007 ! Je la voyais comme une tablette amput\u00e9e de nombreuses fonctions et je ne voyais pas que ce petit appareil l\u00e9ger, relativement peu cher, permettait au lecteur de se concentrer sur le seul texte et ce sans se d\u00e9truire les yeux avec le r\u00e9tro\u00e9clairage un peu trop violent des tablettes. Parlez-moi d\u2019amour \u29eb En fait, c\u2019\u00e9tait le d\u00e9but d\u2019une longue histoire d\u2019amour, et d\u2019un progressif \u00e9loignement du livre papier. \u00c0 force de lire sur ma liseuse, je trouve que le livre (disons traditionnel, mais \u00e7a ne veut tellement rien dire si l\u2019on pense \u00e0 ses multiples m\u00e9tamorphoses, du volumen au codex ) a pour lui plusieurs inconv\u00e9nients : son poids, ses pages qui ne tiennent pas et qui se rabattent, l\u2019ombre de la main (ou simplement toute ombre r\u00e9sultant de la position du livre par rapport \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re) sur la page la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 d\u2019avoir un \u00e9clairage pour lire (c\u2019est tout b\u00eate mais avec la liseuse, j\u2019ai fini par oublier que j\u2019avais besoin d\u2019une source de lumi\u00e8re pour lire), l\u2019encre qui s\u2019efface (du moins celle de ces affreux livres de poche) les traces de doigt ou de tout ce que vous pouvez manipuler lors de votre lecture (allant de la nourriture au c\u00e9rumen, en passant par les crottes de nez\u2026) le papier de mauvaise qualit\u00e9 (car les lecteurs ne sont pas tous assez fortun\u00e9s pour se payer de beaux livres imprim\u00e9s sur du v\u00e9lin). En revanche, force est de constater qu\u2019avec une liseuse, on perd plusieurs choses : on voit moins la couverture et on m\u00e9morise donc moins bien le nom de l\u2019auteur ; on perd la conscience de l\u2019\u00e9paisseur du livre et de l\u2019endroit o\u00f9 l\u2019on se situe. Avec une liseuse, on peut ainsi tr\u00e8s facilement se trouver tout surpris d\u2019\u00eatre \u00e0 la fin (sp\u00e9cialement quand une partie du pourcentage comprend diverses choses comme une postface ou un sommaire). Mais ce n\u2019est pas sans procurer quelque nouvelle \u00e9motion litt\u00e9raire tant on est d\u00e9concert\u00e9 de se trouver \u00e0 la derni\u00e8re page sans que rien ne nous y ait pr\u00e9par\u00e9. Cela dit, il est facile d\u2019afficher la barre de progression, et de voir o\u00f9 on se trouve, mais je n\u2019utilise que fort peu cette possibilit\u00e9. J\u2019appr\u00e9cie aussi de pouvoir acc\u00e9der instantan\u00e9ment au livre d\u00e9sir\u00e9. Je n\u2019ai pas m\u00eame besoin de lever mes fesses pour lire le dernier prix Goncourt. Certains trouveront que c\u2019est un d\u00e9faut. C\u2019est affaire de point de vue. Pour moi qui ai habit\u00e9 dans des lieux o\u00f9 la culture \u00e9tait peu accessible, j\u2019y ai vu un net avantage. Et puis m\u00eame si on peut trouver \u00e0 redire sur les livres et sa vente qui s\u2019apparente davantage \u00e0 de la location, il faudra quand m\u00eame reconna\u00eetre qu\u2019une application comme Calibre vous d\u00e9barrasse bien facilement des DRM ind\u00e9sirables . Bien s\u00fbr, on retrouve toutes (ou la plupart) des fonctionnalit\u00e9s susmentionn\u00e9es, mais il en est d\u2019autres que je suis toujours surpris de n\u2019avoir toujours pas trouv\u00e9 chez Apple. Word Wise \u29eb Cette option favorise l\u2019apprentissage de la langue dans laquelle vous lisez. Elle est certes perfectible, mais elle permet d\u2019afficher des d\u00e9finitions au-dessus des mots, en filigrane en somme. On peut m\u00eame enregistrer le vocabulaire recherch\u00e9 dans le dictionnaire. On se retrouve alors avec un nouveau livre contenant les mots ayant fait l\u2019objet d\u2019une recherche. Tr\u00e8s pratique pour r\u00e9viser, une fois la lecture termin\u00e9e. Le navigateur int\u00e9gr\u00e9 \u29eb Il m\u2019est arriv\u00e9 de constater que le lecteur que j\u2019\u00e9tais devenu ne lisait plus un livre \u00e0 la fois mais plusieurs. En fait, de nombreuses fois, il m\u2019est arriv\u00e9 d\u2019\u00eatre \u00e9tonn\u00e9 par un mot de l\u2019auteur ou de ressentir le besoin de v\u00e9rifier la validit\u00e9 d\u2019une information et je le faisais en utilisant le navigateur int\u00e9gr\u00e9. C\u2019est un acc\u00e8s \u00e0 Wikip\u00e9dia que nous avons ainsi et, comme le dictionnaire int\u00e9gr\u00e9, il permet d\u2019effectuer des recherches assez facilement et rapidement. Passages les plus surlign\u00e9s \u29eb Certains n\u2019aiment pas. Je trouve \u00e7a assez amusant. On peut afficher les passages les plus surlign\u00e9s par les autres lecteurs. Ainsi, au cours de votre lecture, vous voyez que tel passage a \u00e9t\u00e9 soulign\u00e9 tant de fois. Il m\u2019est arriv\u00e9 de relire deux fois un passage que d\u2019autres avaient soulign\u00e9. Je n\u2019y avais tout d\u2019abord pas pr\u00eat\u00e9 attention puis, constatant que le passage avait \u00e9t\u00e9 soulign\u00e9, je me suis dit que peut-\u00eatre je n\u2019avais pas \u00e9t\u00e9 assez attentif. Autres fonctionnalit\u00e9s \u29eb La fonction X-Ray est typiquement du type de celle qui aurait chang\u00e9 ma vie d\u2019\u00e9tudiant. Comme l\u2019indique Amazon : La fonction X-Ray permet d\u2019explorer la structure d\u2019un livre sur le Kindle Touch, ses id\u00e9es essentielles, les personnages ou les th\u00e8mes. Par exemple, cela vous permet d\u2019acc\u00e9der \u00e0 tous les emplacements o\u00f9 le personnage untel appara\u00eet. L\u2019ensemble des personnages peut alors \u00eatre affich\u00e9 par ordre alphab\u00e9tique mais aussi par ordre d\u2019apparition ou encore par ordre de pertinence. De m\u00eame avec les principaux th\u00e8mes du livre, ce qui facilite les r\u00e9visions en vue d\u2019un examen ou un concours. Malheureusement cette fonction ne se trouve pas dans tous les livres, et de surcro\u00eet elle ne se trouve que dans les livres \u00e9crits en anglais. Il y a d\u2019autres options que je n\u2019ai jamais essay\u00e9es comme Kindle FreeTime qui consiste \u00e0 cr\u00e9er un profil, \u00e0 ajouter des livres et cr\u00e9er des d\u00e9fis, des objectifs de lecture pour inciter les enfants \u00e0 lire. D\u2019autres que j\u2019utilise assez peu comme l\u2019option send to Kindle . Mais je go\u00fbte assez la synchronisation de tous les appareils. Je commence un livre sur la Kindle laiss\u00e9e sur la table de nuit. Je peux reprendre dans la journ\u00e9e la lecture sur l\u2019app Kindle install\u00e9e sur mon iPhone, qui lui a le bon go\u00fbt de n\u2019avoir pas \u00e9t\u00e9 oubli\u00e9 sur ladite table de nuit. Voil\u00e0 pour la justification d\u2019une troisi\u00e8me app d\u00e9di\u00e9e \u00e0 la lecture. Mais pourtant j\u2019en ai deux autres. D\u2019autres mani\u00e8res de lire \u29eb Je suis assez \u00e9tonn\u00e9 de voir \u00e0 quel point l\u2019exp\u00e9rience de la lecture peut rev\u00eatir d\u2019\u00e9tranges formes, de constater \u00e0 quel point le num\u00e9rique peut aider ceux qui peinent \u00e0 lire comme ceux qui veulent lire davantage. Voice Dream Reader \u29eb Voice Dream Reader lit vos textes (PDF, ePub), vous permet m\u00eame d\u2019aller en rechercher sur Gutenberg . Ce n\u2019est pas une application de lecture de livres audios. Cela correspond plut\u00f4t \u00e0 la fonction Prononcer \u00e9voqu\u00e9e ci-dessus, ce qu\u2019on appelle aussi plus souvent, en Anglais, text-to-speech. \u00c0 ceci pr\u00e8s qu\u2019un large choix de voix vous est propos\u00e9 (enfin vendu). On peut donc obtenir quelques voix (mais surtout en Anglais) moins \u00ab robotiques \u00bb que celle int\u00e9gr\u00e9e \u00e0 iOS. Cette application prend tout son sens dans le domaine de l\u2019\u00e9ducation puisqu\u2019un \u00e9l\u00e8ve peut suivre la lecture (les mots sont surlign\u00e9s) mais, en plus, il dispose de polices comme Dyslexie ou OpenDyslexic. Cependant, on peut l\u2019utiliser dans certains cas bien pr\u00e9cis : faire lire le livre qui vous passionne dans la voiture (avec un iPhone branch\u00e9 sur l\u2019autoradio par exemple) ou encore pour \u00ab faciliter \u00bb la lecture. En effet, un ami me confiait r\u00e9cemment qu\u2019il utilisait la fonction text-to-speech parce qu\u2019il avait tendance, au cours d\u2019une lecture \u00ab normale \u00bb, \u00e0 vagabonder dans ses pens\u00e9es et \u00e0 perdre le fil (vous savez quand vous continuez \u00e0 lire mais que quelques lignes ou pages plus loin, vous vous apercevez que vous n\u2019avez rien retenu). Au moins, avec une telle fonction, cet ami me disait retenir quelque chose m\u00eame quand son imagination battait la campagne. Son esprit gardait toujours une trace non pas du texte lu , mais du texte entendu. Litz \u29eb C\u2019est un autre ami qui m\u2019a parl\u00e9 de Spritz , une application qui utilise le Rapid Serial Visual Presentation . Concr\u00e8tement, l\u2019application n\u2019affiche qu\u2019un mot \u00e0 la fois contenant une lettre rouge cens\u00e9e fixer votre attention en un point pr\u00e9cis. Cette m\u00e9thode doit pouvoir vous apprendre \u00e0 lire tr\u00e8s vite. Elle n\u2019est pas nouvelle et date des ann\u00e9es 70. Vous trouverez une flop\u00e9e d\u2019applications utilisant cette m\u00e9thode. J\u2019ai pour ma part retenu Litz pour sa capacit\u00e9 \u00e0 lire des ePubs. Mais il faut bien reconna\u00eetre que ce n\u2019est pas la solution la plus plaisante (en tout cas pour moi qui lit et aime \u00e0 lire lentement). Cependant, pour des textes plus courts, de ces articles qui ont donn\u00e9 naissance au terme \u00ab infob\u00e9sit\u00e9 \u00bb, une telle fa\u00e7on de lire peut vous permettre d\u2019entamer votre course contre la montre des textes \u00e0 lire dans la journ\u00e9e. Conclusion \u29eb J\u2019ai omis de nombreuses choses dans cet article, comme les livres enrichis, mais il faudrait aussi traiter du corollaire de la lecture num\u00e9rique et de l\u2019activit\u00e9 de tri, de conservation et d\u2019archivage de ses propres notes de lecture, \u00e9voquer le r\u00f4le des r\u00e9seaux sociaux dans la diffusion des livres (comme Goodreads par exemple), etc. Je m\u2019en voudrais de faire croire que ce tour d\u2019horizon de l\u2019\u00e9tat de la lecture num\u00e9rique en ce d\u00e9but de si\u00e8cle soit une injonction \u00e0 lire sur tablette ou liseuse. Ce n\u2019est pas du tout mon propos et j\u2019ajouterai que le livre papier reste un support on ne peut plus agr\u00e9able et occasionne une d\u00e9connexion reposante (n\u2019\u00e9tait-ce le smartphone ou la tablette qui tra\u00eenent \u00e0 c\u00f4t\u00e9). Quand on me pr\u00eate ou me donne un livre papier, je ne boude pas mon plaisir et je le prends d\u2019autant plus volontiers que ce livre a une histoire que n\u2019aura jamais un fichier \u00e9lectronique. R\u00e9cemment, j\u2019ai \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9mu en tombant sur un livre ayant appartenu \u00e0 mon grand-p\u00e8re d\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9 il y a peu et frapp\u00e9 du sceau de son ex-libris. Mais ne soyons pas trop sentimentaux avec ces objets que sont les livres. Mon grand-p\u00e8re s\u2019en d\u00e9barrassait volontiers, et les bouquinistes sont pleins de ces orphelins dont les gens se d\u00e9tachent par paquets. Au reste, on voit bien que m\u00eame le traditionnel papier peut devenir num\u00e9rique ou plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment un support num\u00e9rique avec la r\u00e9alit\u00e9 augment\u00e9e. C\u2019est ce que j\u2019essaie de faire avec les fiches de lecture que je demande \u00e0 mes \u00e9l\u00e8ves de r\u00e9aliser : une fiche tripartite on ne peut plus conventionnelle est r\u00e9alis\u00e9e et une fois celle-ci corrig\u00e9e, elle est lue par un \u00e9l\u00e8ve qui est film\u00e9. Ce petit travail vid\u00e9o est alors convoqu\u00e9 par le truchement de la r\u00e9alit\u00e9 augment\u00e9e quand un \u00e9l\u00e8ve braque son smartphone au CDI sur la couverture d\u2019un livre pour lequel une fiche de lecture a \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9alis\u00e9e (l\u2019exemple ci-dessus a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait avec une Kindle mais il peut naturellement \u00eatre fait avec un livre papier). Ainsi m\u00eame l\u2019ancien et le nouveau se rejoignent et c\u2019\u00e9tait bien l\u00e0 tout le sens de mon propos. Cependant, il me semble que l\u2019activit\u00e9 de la lecture, avec le num\u00e9rique, s\u2019est complexifi\u00e9e. Assur\u00e9ment, elle s\u2019est au moins diversifi\u00e9e. Mais ce qui amusant, c\u2019est que cette complication s\u2019est accompagn\u00e9e d\u2019une simplification de certains processus : l\u2019acc\u00e8s \u00e0 l\u2019encyclop\u00e9die, aux dictionnaires, \u00e0 l\u2019annotation, \u00e0 l\u2019archivage, au partage\u2026 Il en a de la chance, l\u2019homo numericus !","title":"Qu\u2019est ce que lire au XXIe si\u00e8cle ?"},{"location":"%C3%89criture/Blog/Qu%E2%80%99est-ce%20que%20lire%20au%20XXIe%20si%C3%A8cle%20%3F/#ibooks","text":"Ma premi\u00e8re exp\u00e9rience num\u00e9rique de la lecture (j\u2019entends par l\u00e0 celle d\u2019un vrai livre) fut iBooks sur iPad.

Ce n\u2019est pas du tout mon propos et j\u2019ajouterai que le livre papier reste un support on ne peut plus agr\u00e9able et occasionne une d\u00e9connexion reposante (n\u2019\u00e9tait-ce le smartphone ou la tablette qui tra\u00eenent \u00e0 c\u00f4t\u00e9).

Mais ne soyons pas trop sentimentaux avec ces objets que sont les livres. Mon grand-p\u00e8re s\u2019en d\u00e9barrassait volontiers, et les bouquinistes sont pleins de ces orphelins dont les gens se d\u00e9tachent par paquets. Au reste, on voit bien que m\u00eame le traditionnel papier peut devenir num\u00e9rique ou plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment un support num\u00e9rique avec la r\u00e9alit\u00e9 augment\u00e9e. C\u2019est ce que j\u2019essaie de faire avec les fiches de lecture que je demande \u00e0 mes \u00e9l\u00e8ves de r\u00e9aliser : une fiche tripartite on ne peut plus conventionnelle est r\u00e9alis\u00e9e et une fois celle-ci corrig\u00e9e, elle est lue par un \u00e9l\u00e8ve qui est film\u00e9. Ce petit travail vid\u00e9o est alors convoqu\u00e9 par le truchement de la r\u00e9alit\u00e9 augment\u00e9e quand un \u00e9l\u00e8ve braque son smartphone au CDI sur la couverture d\u2019un livre pour lequel une fiche de lecture a \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9alis\u00e9e (l\u2019exemple ci-dessus a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait avec une Kindle mais il peut naturellement \u00eatre fait avec un livre papier).

On s\u2019\u00e9tonnera peut-\u00eatre que l\u2019on s\u2019\u00e9tonne du contenu des \u00e9missions de Finkielkraut. Au reste, je ne saurais dire ce que je pense de ce dernier dont les propos \u00e0 forte teneur r\u00e9actionnaire me semblent souvent choquants (sur France Inter \u00e0 propos de Roman Polanski), mais j\u2019en parlerai peut-\u00eatre un jour, si je n\u2019ai rien d\u2019autre \u00e0 faire. Bref. Pierre Assouline d\u00e9plorait que nombre d\u2019id\u00e9es re\u00e7ues sur l\u2019informatique, sur son \u00e9crasante domination et sa menace sur le livre aient \u00e9t\u00e9 une fois de plus r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e9es \u00e0 l\u2019envi. Or il se trouve que je lis actuellement une s\u00e9rie d\u2019entretiens entre Umberto Eco et Jean-Claude Carri\u00e8re (N\u2019esp\u00e9rez pas vous d\u00e9barrasser des livres). J\u2019ai la conviction (il faudrait v\u00e9rifier, \u00e9couter l\u2019\u00e9mission de France Culture) que la pr\u00e9sence d\u2019Umberto Eco a servi de garde-fou aux d\u00e9bordements disons r\u00e9actionnaires de Carri\u00e8re. Ce dernier ne cache pas ou mal sa d\u00e9fiance pour l\u2019informatique. Umberto Eco \u00e9tant un utilisateur de longue date d\u2019ordinateurs (d\u00e8s les ann\u00e9es 80), il s\u2019est int\u00e9ress\u00e9 \u00e0 la programmation (\u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque, le basic, entre autres), il ne rechigne pas non plus \u00e0 exploser quelques envahisseurs extraterrestres pour se divertir, etc. Il ne voit donc pas dans l\u2019informatique une menace. En revanche, il croit en la sup\u00e9riorit\u00e9 du livre sur l\u2019ordinateur, mais il ne pense pas que l\u2019informatique tuera le livre. La pr\u00e9face est d\u00e9j\u00e0 un avertissement (celle de Jean-Philippe de Tonnac menant les entretiens), qui reprend en la d\u00e9mentant la citation hugolienne, laquelle expliquait comment l\u2019intelligence humaine avait quitt\u00e9 l\u2019architecture (la cath\u00e9drale) pour l\u2019imprimerie (\u00ab Ceci tuera cela. Le livre tuera l\u2019\u00e9difice \u00bb). Cependant, les cath\u00e9drales existent toujours. Il en sera de m\u00eame pour le livre. L\u2019e-book ne tuera pas le livre. Ils coexisteront. De toute fa\u00e7on, l\u2019e-book n\u2019entre pas en concurrence avec le livre. Il en est une d\u00e9clinaison, une \u00e9volution qui ne remplace par l\u2019objet originel dans lequel Umberto Eco voit la perfection. Selon lui, on ne peut pas faire mieux, on ne peut pas inventer mieux (comme la roue, la cuill\u00e8re...). Mon propos n\u2019\u00e9tant pas de prouver la sup\u00e9riorit\u00e9 du livre sur l\u2019ordinateur, je n\u2019insiste pas (j\u2019aime trop les deux), mais lisez N\u2019esp\u00e9rez pas vous d\u00e9barrasser des livres. C\u2019est passionnant (Carri\u00e8re dit des choses tr\u00e8s justes sur l\u2019informatique, notamment les nouvelles techniques, page 47). Poursuivons. Pierre Assouline se rit des invit\u00e9s de Finkielkraut qui s\u2019inqui\u00e8tent \u00ab du caract\u00e8re pr\u00e9caire de la conservation des donn\u00e9es \u00bb en informatique. \u00c0 dire vrai, j\u2019imagine que l\u2019\u00e9mission a d\u00fb \u00eatre \u00e9prouvante \u00e0 \u00e9couter (Finkielkraut pareil \u00e0 lui-m\u00eame, Carri\u00e8re qui se l\u00e2che, etc.), mais ils ne doivent pas avoir tout \u00e0 fait tort. Dans N\u2019esp\u00e9rez pas vous d\u00e9barrasser des livres, Umberto Eco \u00e9voque \u00e0 juste titre ce probl\u00e8me \u00e0 plusieurs reprises. Lorsqu\u2019il explique, page 82, qu\u2019il n\u2019a jamais retrouv\u00e9 une premi\u00e8re version du Pendule de Foucault enregistr\u00e9 sur une disquette en 1984 ou 1985, on fr\u00e9mit. Ces donn\u00e9es sont extr\u00eamement pr\u00e9caires et pas seulement parce qu\u2019on peut les \u00e9garer, mais parce qu\u2019elles sont grav\u00e9es sur des supports en permanente \u00e9volution et obsolescence (de la bande magn\u00e9tique \u00e0 la clef USB en passant par les disquettes de diff\u00e9rents formats, les CD-ROM, les DVD-ROM, les disques durs IDE et SATA puis SSD...). Dans le livre d\u2019entretien, ils omettent un autre probl\u00e8me qui me para\u00eet particuli\u00e8rement inqui\u00e9tant, celui du format choisi. La plupart du temps, nous confions nos pr\u00e9cieuses donn\u00e9es (et la m\u00e9moire de l\u2019humanit\u00e9 tout enti\u00e8re) \u00e0 un \u00e9diteur de logiciel que beaucoup ne se donnent m\u00eame pas la peine de payer. Tr\u00e8s souvent, il s\u2019agit de Microsoft (Word, Works...). Avez-vous pourtant id\u00e9e du nombre de logiciels de traitement de texte existant ? Vous \u00eates-vous d\u00e9j\u00e0 demand\u00e9 ce qui arriverait si le logiciel que vous avez l\u2019habitude d\u2019utiliser cessait d\u2019exister ? Ce n\u2019est pas impossible. Pensez \u00e0 AppleWorks. Pensez \u00e0... Word (lien) qui pourrait dispara\u00eetre ou dont le format de fichier a chang\u00e9 (de .doc \u00e0 .docx). C\u2019est pourquoi il serait sain de s\u2019en remettre \u00e0 un format ouvert, celui d\u2019OpenOffice (.odt + lien). De tout cela, j\u2019en conclus qu\u2019un vieux \u00ab chnoque \u00bb comme Jean-Claude Carri\u00e8re a des choses fort int\u00e9ressantes \u00e0 dire et \u00e0 nous apprendre, m\u00eame si elles me semblent provenir d\u2019un esprit qui ne comprend pas bien (et encore !) son \u00e9poque. Et puis, c\u2019est la premi\u00e8re fois que je lis avec tant d\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat un auteur avec lequel je pourrais \u00eatre en total d\u00e9saccord sur certains points, tant il est vrai que la m\u00e9fiance envers internet m\u2019horripile (pensez \u00e0 Jacques S\u00e9gu\u00e9la et \u00e0 je ne sais plus qui).

On est, pour reprendre les termes de l\u2019ancienne rh\u00e9torique, dans le domaine de l\u2019\u00e9pidictique : on loue ou on bl\u00e2me. Louons donc. L\u2019iPod, ce petit objet technique (technique, pas technologique), frivole, pour certains, est pour moi d\u2019une importance capitale. C\u2019est mon dada, et je l\u2019enfourche. Il ne sert pas \u00e0 me tympaniser de bruits de casseroles qui sombreront t\u00f4t ou tard dans les limbes musicaux de l\u2019oubli. Enfin si ! Il me sert \u00e0 \u00e9couter ma musique, mais pas seulement. D\u00e8s le d\u00e9but de l\u2019utilisation de cet objet, un mot a attir\u00e9 mon attention. Podcast. Le podcast, dont l\u2019\u00e9tymologie dit assez le lien \u00e9troit qu\u2019il entretient avec ledit objet, est une \u00e9mission audio, vid\u00e9o parfois, que l\u2019on peut t\u00e9l\u00e9charger et \u00e9couter sur son ordinateur ou son iPod. Aujourd\u2019hui, tout le monde diffuse des podcasts. Si j\u2019en avais le temps, j\u2019en ferais. T\u00e9l\u00e9rama a ses podcasts. France radio a ses podcasts, et \u00e7a, c\u2019est le comble du bonheur (vous ne le voyez pas, mais j\u2019entre en p\u00e2moison). Songez qu\u2019il y a peu, on enregistrait des \u00e9missions de radio avec une cassette. Quelle \u00e9poque barbare ! Aujourd\u2019hui on les t\u00e9l\u00e9charge, et on les \u00e9coute o\u00f9 l\u2019on veut (dans sa voiture, chez soi, en marchant...). Pascale Clark, St\u00e9phane Guillon, ou m\u00eame Umberto Eco \u00e9gaient mes mornes trajets, mes moments perdus, comme dans les salles d\u2019attente o\u00f9, auparavant, j\u2019en \u00e9tais r\u00e9duit \u00e0 feuilleter un m\u00e9chant Voici vieux de plusieurs ann\u00e9es, souill\u00e9 par des milliers de mains de patients, tra\u00eenant sur la table basse entre Le Point et Auto machin truc (que l\u2019on ne me dise pas qu\u2019on peut lire un livre : soit la pire station de radio a \u00e9t\u00e9 s\u00e9lectionn\u00e9e, soit un phtisique agonisant emplit la salle de sa terrible toux , soit on entreprend de vous faire parler de la pluie et du beau temps, et le reste \u00e0 l\u2019avenant...). Heureusement, il y a, et qui l\u2019e\u00fbt cru (qui l\u2019e\u00fbt dit, ajoutait Corneille), le livre audio, qui vous permet, avec les \u00e9couteurs sur les oreilles, de vous absenter du monde. Je n\u2019ai connu qu\u2019une seule personne capable de vous parler dans un tel moment... Il fut un temps o\u00f9 le livre audio me semblait l\u2019intrus des librairies. Je me souviens, \u00e0 Bordeaux, que les enregistrements d\u2019\u0153uvres litt\u00e9raires figuraient en nombre r\u00e9duit sur un pr\u00e9sentoir isol\u00e9, perdu au milieu de milliers de livres, les v\u00e9ritables vedettes du lieu. R\u00e9guli\u00e8rement, je passais \u00e0 c\u00f4t\u00e9 de ces enregistrements dans la plus grande indiff\u00e9rence. Je les voyais, parce que je passais devant, mais jamais je n\u2019avais eu l\u2019envie d\u2019en \u00e9couter un seul. Depuis les choses ont chang\u00e9. Je ne les regarde toujours pas quand j\u2019en vois, mais la raison en est toute diff\u00e9rente. Il y a que j\u2019ai accueilli la d\u00e9mat\u00e9rialisation de la musique avec joie. Voir dispara\u00eetre toutes ces bo\u00eetes, tous ces fragiles et encombrants CD a \u00e9t\u00e9 une r\u00e9jouissance. Ils sont d\u00e9sormais \u00ab dans \u00bb mon ordinateur bien rang\u00e9s. Je les trouve instantan\u00e9ment. Et quand je ne parviens pas \u00e0 mettre la main sur un titre, je tape les premi\u00e8res lettres, et le fichier d\u00e9sir\u00e9 appara\u00eet aussit\u00f4t. ![[ipod-enceinte.jpg]] En fait, il y a quelques ann\u00e9es, un ami \u00e9tait venu un jour avec un iPod. C\u2019\u00e9tait, je crois, en 2004. La chose \u00e9tait blanche, \u00e9tait \u00e9paisse, avait une capacit\u00e9 de quelques gigas. L\u2019\u00e9cran \u00e9tait en noir et blanc. J\u2019ai fini par en acqu\u00e9rir un, puis deux, puis trois, v\u00e9ritable tonneau des dana\u00efdes. Jamais remplis. Je passe mon temps \u00e0 d\u00e9verser l\u00e0-dedans toutes sortes de fichiers. Et depuis l\u2019iPod touch, les possibilit\u00e9s se sont accrues. Ainsi, disais-je, j\u2019aime d\u00e9sormais particuli\u00e8rement \u00e9couter les livres audio. Peut-\u00eatre l\u2019indiff\u00e9rence \u00e9prouv\u00e9e jadis s\u2019est-elle mu\u00e9e en go\u00fbt quand il s\u2019est agi de chercher des enregistrements de contes pour mes filles. La d\u00e9couverte des contes de Pierre Gripari lus par lui-m\u00eame fut une grande r\u00e9jouissance. Un de ces moments clefs qui changent radicalement votre vision des choses. Je voyais aussi sur iTunes ce catalogue immense de livres, mais en anglais, \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque de livres \u00e0 t\u00e9l\u00e9charger. J\u2019avais fait quelques essais, mais mon niveau en anglais me permettait rarement d\u2019\u00eatre assez attentif \u00e0 l\u2019enregistrement audio et \u00e0 la route en m\u00eame temps (cette \u00e9coute est tr\u00e8s li\u00e9e au transport, \u00e0 la marche, au d\u00e9placement, alors que la lecture du livre est li\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019immobilit\u00e9, \u00e0 la chaise, au fauteuil). Et puis, r\u00e9cemment, j\u2019ai d\u00e9couvert de fa\u00e7on assez inattendue litteratureaudio.com, par un lien sur Wikipedia. Depuis, j\u2019ai t\u00e9l\u00e9charg\u00e9 une bonne quantit\u00e9 d\u2019enregistrements. Ils sont disponibles au t\u00e9l\u00e9chargement gratuitement au format MP3. Ils sont de qualit\u00e9s in\u00e9gales, tant il est vrai que lire \u00e0 voix haute est un don qui n\u2019est pas donn\u00e9 \u00e0 tout le monde. C\u2019est comme chanter, si on n\u2019a pas ce je-ne-sais-quoi, qui vous diff\u00e9rencie des autres, vous avez beau chanter correctement, vous ne procurez aucun frisson. Lire, c\u2019est la m\u00eame chose. Cela demande des dons d\u2019interpr\u00e9tations, un v\u00e9ritable travail d\u2019acteur invisible ! Mais le catalogue est vaste, et on trouve de tr\u00e8s bonnes lectures gracieusement offertes. On ne va pas faire le difficile. Et songez qu\u2019un livre audio dans le commerce, c\u2019est une douzaine d\u2019euros... Enfin, avec l\u2019acc\u00e8s \u00e0 internet, l\u2019iPod - et depuis l\u2019iPhone - s\u2019est m\u00fb en v\u00e9ritable petit ordinateur. Je ne m\u2019\u00e9talerai pas sur ma d\u00e9pendance \u00e0 internet, mais j\u2019\u00e9voquerai tous ces logiciels que l\u2019on peut installer, les jeux par exemple, mais je ne saurais vous inviter \u00e0 jouer, mais plut\u00f4t \u00e0 travailler, quoique j\u2019appr\u00e9cie grandement de pouvoir massacrer des hordes de zombies assoiff\u00e9s de sang. Umberto Eco vous expliquerait - pardonnez cette digression (autre partie de la rh\u00e9torique) - que des jeux avec des armes sont sains, et que ceux qui jouent au Lego travaillent ensuite \u00e0 Auschwitz... Bref, je vous conseillerai de charger votre iPod de tous ces logiciels que sont les dictionnaires \u00e0 bas prix voire gratuits : Littr\u00e9, Larousse, TLF, Antidote, dictionnaires des synonymes, des difficult\u00e9s de la langue fran\u00e7aise, des citations... J\u2019arr\u00eate l\u00e0.

Je pensais, au d\u00e9but, simplement faire l\u2019essai du passage de l\u2019un \u00e0 l\u2019autre, voir s\u2019il \u00e9tait seulement envisageable de troquer l\u2019un pour l\u2019autre, mais je me vois aujourd\u2019hui difficilement faire marche arri\u00e8re. Les quelques lignes qui suivent tentent d\u2019apporter une r\u00e9ponse, m\u00eame si tout a probablement d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 dit sur la chose. Mais enfin, voici mon exp\u00e9rience propre. Un poids en moins \u29eb Moi qui trimballe ma machine chaque jour que Steve Jobs fait (ou faisait), la premi\u00e8re chose que j\u2019ai observ\u00e9e - ou plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment ressentie - est la l\u00e9g\u00e8ret\u00e9 nouvelle de mon sac. Le Mac avec son chargeur atteint facilement ses quatre kilos alors que l\u2019iPad p\u00e8se moins de 700 grammes ! Mon sac me para\u00eet m\u00eame vide, et ne l\u2019a pas en horreur (le vide). J\u2019ai aussi gagn\u00e9 de la place sur mon bureau. S\u2019il y a bien une chose que je d\u00e9plore depuis que j\u2019enseigne \u00e0 l\u2019aide d\u2019un ordinateur et d\u2019un vid\u00e9oprojecteur, c\u2019est le truchement de la machine, cette fronti\u00e8re m\u00eame t\u00e9nue qui s\u2019interpose entre mes \u00e9l\u00e8ves et moi. Et franchement, quoi de plus triste que ces professeurs qui restent assis derri\u00e8re leur bureau, les mains sur le clavier ? D\u00e9sormais, je branche donc l\u2019iPad sur le vid\u00e9oprojecteur (il faut pour cela un adaptateur VGA). Il est d\u2019ailleurs si petit qu\u2019il se ferait presque oublier s\u2019il ne suscitait chez les \u00e9l\u00e8ves un \u00e9merveillement auquel je ne m\u2019attendais pas. S\u2019ils sont parfaitement blas\u00e9s quand un enseignant sort son ordinateur, f\u00fbt-ce un Mac tout rutilant, ils sombrent dans une b\u00e9atitude dont on les sort difficilement les premiers jours quand on exhibe (malgr\u00e9 soi) un iPad. Les jours passants, l\u2019outil se fait plus ou moins oublier et l\u2019on peut travailler. Mais je ne peux m\u2019emp\u00eacher de me demander ce que serait un cours si d\u2019aventure l\u2019administration consentait \u00e0 \u00e9quiper ma salle d\u2019un vid\u00e9oprojecteur wi-fi (je ne sais m\u00eame pas si la chose existe) ? Que ne pourrait-on faire alors ? D\u00e9ambuler dans la salle, quitter ce bureau monotone, et, la tablette \u00e0 la main, afficher tel ou tel point de grammaire en fonction des difficult\u00e9s aper\u00e7ues dans les rangs (par exemple)... Il va de soi que, dans ces conditions (et m\u00eame sans wi-fi), on ne tourne plus le dos aux \u00e9l\u00e8ves lorsque l\u2019on \u00e9crit au tableau. Pas mal, non ? En plus du poids, il est un autre avantage li\u00e9 aux tablettes num\u00e9riques : la batterie qui, pour ce que j\u2019en fais, tient largement toute la journ\u00e9e. Je n\u2019ai donc pas besoin de prise de courant, et il y a ainsi, dans ma classe, un fil de moins dans lequel les \u00e9l\u00e8ves venant au tableau peuvent se prendre les pieds. Ce n\u2019est pas rien. Comme dans un livre \u29eb ![[photo.png]] S\u2019il est une chose qui, lorsque j\u2019allume l\u2019iPad me s\u00e9duit tout particuli\u00e8rement, c\u2019est l\u2019interface dans ce qu\u2019elle a de plus proche avec l\u2019objet qu\u2019elle imite. Ainsi, le calendrier (iCal) ou les livres (dans iBooks) ont l\u2019avantage du num\u00e9rique (je peux les projeter, les annoter, zoomer...), ils ont aussi l\u2019avantage du papier dont on tourne les pages. Ils se pr\u00e9sentent dans toute leur familiarit\u00e9 d\u2019objets connus. C\u2019est alors un plaisir esth\u00e9tique et pratique qu\u2019on ne cesse que difficilement d\u2019appr\u00e9cier beno\u00eetement \u00e0 chaque utilisation. Ainsi quand je donne les devoirs \u00e0 faire, les \u00e9l\u00e8ves ont le calendrier sous les yeux.

J\u2019ai aussi gagn\u00e9 de la place sur mon bureau. S\u2019il y a bien une chose que je d\u00e9plore depuis que j\u2019enseigne \u00e0 l\u2019aide d\u2019un ordinateur et d\u2019un vid\u00e9oprojecteur, c\u2019est le truchement de la machine, cette fronti\u00e8re m\u00eame t\u00e9nue qui s\u2019interpose entre mes \u00e9l\u00e8ves et moi. Et franchement, quoi de plus triste que ces professeurs qui restent assis derri\u00e8re leur bureau, les mains sur le clavier ? D\u00e9sormais, je branche donc l\u2019iPad sur le vid\u00e9oprojecteur (il faut pour cela un adaptateur VGA). Il est d\u2019ailleurs si petit qu\u2019il se ferait presque oublier s\u2019il ne suscitait chez les \u00e9l\u00e8ves un \u00e9merveillement auquel je ne m\u2019attendais pas. S\u2019ils sont parfaitement blas\u00e9s quand un enseignant sort son ordinateur, f\u00fbt-ce un Mac tout rutilant, ils sombrent dans une b\u00e9atitude dont on les sort difficilement les premiers jours quand on exhibe (malgr\u00e9 soi) un iPad. Les jours passants, l\u2019outil se fait plus ou moins oublier et l\u2019on peut travailler. Mais je ne peux m\u2019emp\u00eacher de me demander ce que serait un cours si d\u2019aventure l\u2019administration consentait \u00e0 \u00e9quiper ma salle d\u2019un vid\u00e9oprojecteur wi-fi (je ne sais m\u00eame pas si la chose existe) ? Que ne pourrait-on faire alors ? D\u00e9ambuler dans la salle, quitter ce bureau monotone, et, la tablette \u00e0 la main, afficher tel ou tel point de grammaire en fonction des difficult\u00e9s aper\u00e7ues dans les rangs (par exemple)... Il va de soi que, dans ces conditions (et m\u00eame sans wi-fi), on ne tourne plus le dos aux \u00e9l\u00e8ves lorsque l\u2019on \u00e9crit au tableau. Pas mal, non ? En plus du poids, il est un autre avantage li\u00e9 aux tablettes num\u00e9riques : la batterie qui, pour ce que j\u2019en fais, tient largement toute la journ\u00e9e. Je n\u2019ai donc pas besoin de prise de courant, et il y a ainsi, dans ma classe, un fil de moins dans lequel les \u00e9l\u00e8ves venant au tableau peuvent se prendre les pieds.

Que trouvez-vous ? Figure 5 \u29eb Avant d\u2019en venir \u00e0 quelques figures plus exotiques, voici un extrait de Quatre vingt-treize de Victor Hugo. Une mine. Un canon qui casse son amarre devient brusquement on ne sait quelle b\u00eate surnaturelle. C\u2019est une machine qui se transforme en monstre. Cette masse court sur ses roues, a des mouvements de bille de billard, penche avec le roulis, plonge avec le tangage, va, vient, s\u2019arr\u00eate, para\u00eet m\u00e9diter, reprend sa course, traverse comme une fl\u00e8che le navire d\u2019un bout \u00e0 l\u2019autre, pirouette, se d\u00e9robe, s\u2019\u00e9vade, se cabre, heurte, \u00e9br\u00e8che, tue, extermine.

Le site n\u2019est-il pas n\u00e9 du d\u00e9sir d\u2019offrir \u00e0 tous \u2013 surtout aux \u00e9l\u00e8ves ne b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiant d\u2019aucun soutien scolaire \u2013 la possibilit\u00e9 de trouver une aide sans inscription, sans mot de passe ou sans contrepartie quelconque ? Il s\u2019agissait aussi de proposer, \u00e0 l\u2019enseignant d\u00e9sireux de trouver un peu d\u2019inspiration, des ressources qu\u2019il pourrait adapter \u00e0 sa guise. D\u00e8s lors la libert\u00e9 \u00e9tait inscrite dans les g\u00e8nes du site. J\u2019avais d\u2019ailleurs repris \u00e0 mon compte ces mots de Condorcet afin de montrer que la notion de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 intellectuelle \u00e9tait un abus qu\u2019il fallait d\u00e9noncer (1) . Par le pass\u00e9, j\u2019usais du mot \u00ablibre\u00bb sans trop savoir quelle notion il recouvrait. Plus tard, je d\u00e9couvrais les licences Creative Commons et m\u2019emparait de celle-ci . Cela signifiait : fais ce que tu veux, mais ne vends pas. Or cette clause non commerciale (et cela a \u00e9t\u00e9 dit de nombreuses fois) est un frein \u00e0 la diffusion du savoir. Et Ralentir travaux n\u2019a pas vocation \u00e0 se recroqueviller sur lui-m\u00eame dans la crainte d\u2019une exploitation commerciale. Ce serait un non-sens. Au reste, nombreuses sont les personnes requ\u00e9rant l\u2019autorisation d\u2019utiliser telle ou telle partie du site, et invariablement la r\u00e9ponse est affirmative. Seule une demande \u00e9tait rest\u00e9e sans suite en raison de cette fameuse clause NC\u2026 Il est donc n\u00e9cessaire de recourir \u00e0 une nouvelle licence . Seuls le partage \u00e0 l\u2019identique et la reconnaissance de la paternit\u00e9 de l\u2019\u0153uvre seront exig\u00e9s. Que l\u2019on me pardonne ce dernier sursaut d\u2019orgueil (que m\u2019accorde le droit), mais je tiens encore un peu \u00e0 ma prog\u00e9niture ! J\u2019ai juste envie de lui donner un peu le large, et d\u2019observer de loin ce qu\u2019elle devient entre les mains de ceux qui voudront bien s\u2019en emparer, et, je l\u2019esp\u00e8re, la diffuser plus largement encore. Mais, avant d\u2019adopter une telle licence, je voudrais poser une condition. Il y a quelque temps j\u2019affichais un bandeau afin de susciter les dons. Je paie les frais d\u2019h\u00e9bergement et ceux li\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019achat du nom de domaine, les logiciels ou leurs mises \u00e0 jour. Que dire de mon Mac achet\u00e9 en 2008, si ce n\u2019est qu\u2019il est vieillissant (2) ? Je ne demande pas de salaire pour les ann\u00e9es pass\u00e9es \u00e0 b\u00e2tir Ralentir travaux, mais je veux bien un peu d\u2019aide pour continuer l\u2019\u0153uvre. Or ces dons, malgr\u00e9 la promesse que pouvaient constituer les milliers de visites quotidiennes (3) , se sont montr\u00e9s largement insuffisants (4) . En un an, \u00e0 peine de quoi acheter InDesign ou un logiciel de ce type\u2026 J\u2019ai fait mes calculs. J\u2019aurais besoin de 2000 \u00e0 2500 \u20ac pour acheter diverses choses (nouvel ordinateur, un micro, quelques logiciels, etc.). Une telle somme est donc la condition du changement de licence. Cela en vaut-il la peine ? J\u2019avoue que je suis assez curieux de le d\u00e9couvrir. Peut-\u00eatre cette demande fera-t-elle un joli flop. En ce cas, la question de la licence ne taraude que moi. Toujours est-il que nombre de sites recourent annuellement aux dons. Je m\u2019en remets donc \u00e0 ce principe. Et encore ! je n\u2019attends m\u00eame pas une cotisation annuelle, mais celle de sept ans pass\u00e9s \u00e0 construire le site et plus encore, puisque je n\u2019entends pas m\u2019arr\u00eater l\u00e0 (le manuel de 5e est d\u00e9j\u00e0 en chantier). Bref, il ne reste plus qu\u2019\u00e0 organiser ce financement, mais vous pouvez d\u2019ores et d\u00e9j\u00e0 faire un don sur Ralentir travaux . Pass\u00e9 le seuil financier susmentionn\u00e9, Ralentir travaux (tout : le site , les manuels ) devient libre. Notes : 1 \u2013 Je parle, bien entendu, de mon propre cas. Il ne me viendrait, par exemple, nullement \u00e0 l\u2019id\u00e9e de tenir un tel discours au sujet de Michel Tournier ou d\u2019Umberto Eco. Simplement, le professeur que je suis ne saurait pr\u00e9tendre \u00e0 faire valoir un privil\u00e8ge reposant simplement sur quelques ann\u00e9es d\u2019\u00e9tudes. 2 \u2013 Je ne peux m\u00eame plus enregistrer de screencast sans que les ventilateurs de l\u2019ordinateur se mettent \u00e0 souffler \u00e0 tous les diables, rendant par l\u00e0 m\u00eame la vid\u00e9o inaudible. 3 \u2013 1 633 891 visiteurs durant l\u2019ann\u00e9e 2013. 4 \u2013 Un merci exponentiel agr\u00e9ment\u00e9 d\u2019un bisou d\u00e9goulinant \u00e0 tous ceux qui m\u2019ont envoy\u00e9 leurs dons.

Ils devront le rendre avant la fin de l'ann\u00e9e, ce qui correspond \u00e0 peu pr\u00e8s \u00e0 la mi-juin. Sur une ann\u00e9e de 9 mois, c'est 7/8 mois avec un ordinateur. Dans mon coll\u00e8ge, cela fait donc deux jours que nos \u00e9l\u00e8ves travaillent avec une machine et ce qui m'a int\u00e9ress\u00e9, c'\u00e9tait de d\u00e9terminer ce que cela change de passer du papier \u00e0 l'ordinateur. Bien s\u00fbr, en deux jours, pas le temps de faire grand-chose et, pourtant, le bouleversement est consid\u00e9rable. Le clavier \u29eb M\u00eame si beaucoup de choses se font \u00e0 la souris, l'utilisation de ce \u00ab p\u00e9riph\u00e9rique \u00bb s'impose d\u00e8s les premiers instants. Je me souviens pourtant avoir lu quelque part que l'apprentissage du clavier \u00e9tait aujourd'hui d'autant plus superf\u00e9tatoire que de nouvelles mani\u00e8res de saisie du texte se d\u00e9veloppaient (que l'on songe \u00e0 la dict\u00e9e vocale). Mais, dans le cadre scolaire, j'imagine mal toute une classe dicter \u00e0 voix haute le contenu de la le\u00e7on. Et puis si la dict\u00e9e vocale fonctionne chaque jour un peu mieux, il faut reconna\u00eetre qu'elle est encore perfectible. Que ceux qui dictent \u00e0 leur smartphone leur texto en voiture ou leur tweet \u00e0 la montre connect\u00e9e l\u00e8vent la main. Au reste, l'apprentissage de la programmation ne se fera pas \u00e0 coups de dict\u00e9e de vocale. On a besoin du clavier. Les \u00e9l\u00e8ves, qui sont devenus, rappelez-vous, des petites poucettes, sont aujourd'hui davantage accoutum\u00e9s au clavier de leur t\u00e9l\u00e9phone qu'\u00e0 celui de l'ordinateur. Ils peinent \u00e0 trouver ou \u00e0 obtenir certains caract\u00e8res. Ils sollicitent essentiellement les index voire un index. \ud83d\ude31 La prise de note (dans le sens de \u00ab noter ce qui est \u00e9crit \u00bb) est lente. Heureusement, au Conseil d\u00e9partemental des Landes, on a pens\u00e9 \u00e0 ajouter dans la pl\u00e9iade d'applications install\u00e9es et qui bouffent la moiti\u00e9 du SSD [une application pour apprendre \u00e0 taper au clavier].

Il y a des exercices tr\u00e8s progressifs pour apprendre \u00e0 taper au clavier en positionnant correctement les doigts, les mains, et d'ailleurs tout le corps afin d'\u00e9viter la fatigue musculaire. Et puis on peut d\u00e9couvrir les joies de la dactylographie en tapant des s\u00e9ries de lettres, de mots voire de dict\u00e9es.

C'est l\u00e0 un premier travail \u00e0 la notion de format. Et je voyais bien que pour eux une image, c'est une image. gif, png, jpg, pdf, raw... Tout cela est bien loin de leurs pr\u00e9occupations. On a enfin remarqu\u00e9 que le correcteur orthographique n'\u00e9tait pas toujours d'une grande aide. Si l'\u00e9l\u00e8ve \u00e9crit un mot dont l'orthographe lui propose de grandes difficult\u00e9s, le traitement de texte ne saura pas lui proposer la solution. En revanche, en utilisant Le Petit Robert, c'est autre chose. \u00c9crivons le mot phon\u00e9tiquement et le logiciel trouvera la solution ! S'organiser \u29eb [Nous utiliserons Evernote pour cr\u00e9er un cahier num\u00e9rique]. \u00c7a a \u00e9t\u00e9 un moment int\u00e9ressant d'expliquer que l'informatique se d\u00e9veloppe \u00e0 coups de m\u00e9taphores . Celle du bureau, par exemple. Je n'ai pas pu r\u00e9sister aux joies de l'explication \u00e9tymologique. De la bure recouvrant la table, au bureau sur lequel on \u00e9crit, en terminant par le bureau de l'ordinateur, on voit l\u00e0 combien la vie des mots est riche de significations. Mais revenons \u00e0 nos m\u00e9taphores. Evernote n'y \u00e9chappe pas. Avec cette application, on prend des notes qui prennent place dans des carnets qu'on peut cr\u00e9er autant que besoin est. Les carnets peuvent \u00eatre assembl\u00e9s, ce qu'on appelles des piles. On a l\u00e0 une sorte de classeur, m\u00e9taphore que l'on retrouve avec l'application OneNote de Microsoft. On voit l\u00e0 que le num\u00e9rique reproduit le r\u00e9el. Rien de neuf sous le soleil, mais on voit bien aussi qu'il y ajoute des fonctionnalit\u00e9s in\u00e9dites. Le classeur num\u00e9rique peut et doit \u00eatre partag\u00e9e . Avec moi, bien s\u00fbr mais aussi avec les autres \u00e9l\u00e8ves. J'ai acc\u00e8s \u00e0 leur cahier en permanence. Les absents ont le mien en permanence. L'application contenant un chat, c'est comme si en ouvrant le cahier de l'\u00e9l\u00e8ve, il y avait \u00e0 l'int\u00e9rieur une possibilit\u00e9 de communication entre les \u00e9l\u00e8ves et leur professeur . C'est d'ailleurs une belle fa\u00e7on de communiquer des documents. Fin des photocopies. C'est aussi un extraordinaire moyen de rattraper les cours que l'on a manqu\u00e9s. Le rapport au cours \u29eb La machine en main, le comportement des \u00e9l\u00e8ves en classe a compl\u00e8tement chang\u00e9. En bien et en mal. Tout d'abord, ils doivent comprendre que ce n'est pas une version moderne de la fen\u00eatre par laquelle ils regardent pour tromper leur ennui. Bref, si l'on n'a pas besoin de l'ordinateur, on le ferme. Je ne veux pas parler \u00e0 des \u00e9l\u00e8ves qui font autre chose. Mais quand ils notent (et il faut pr\u00e9ciser que nous avons r\u00e9ceptionn\u00e9 ces ordinateurs \u00e0 un moment o\u00f9 on faisait un travail tr\u00e8s classique de r\u00e9vision de la conjugaison), j'ai remarqu\u00e9 un surcro\u00eet d'attention . Habituellement, les \u00e9l\u00e8ves attendent que le malchanceux qui est au tableau ait fini d'\u00e9crire pour recopier. L\u00e0, ils notaient en m\u00eame temps. Ne risquant pas de raturer un r\u00e9sultat incorrect, ils pouvaient sur leur traitement de texte tout noter sans risque d'erreur et sans avoir \u00e0 recopier deux fois les choses (une fois au brouillon, une fois au propre). Ce ne sont l\u00e0 que quelques remarques, quelques observations rapides. Ce ne sont pas des pratiques num\u00e9riques extr\u00eamement d\u00e9velopp\u00e9es, mais les \u00e9l\u00e8ves ont eu le sentiment de d\u00e9couvrir une machine et des usages possibles auxquels ils n'avaient jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 confront\u00e9s, alors m\u00eame qu'ils sont des usagers depuis plusieurs ann\u00e9es. Et ce sur des choses tr\u00e8s simples ! Imaginez quand nous poursuivrons avec la web radio, la t\u00e9l\u00e9 ou l'initiation au wikicode ! Il y a tant \u00e0 faire pour cr\u00e9er cette culture num\u00e9rique qui n'appartient \u00e0 aucune mati\u00e8re et que parfois aucune mati\u00e8re ne saisit.","title":"Un ordinateur entre les mains d'un coll\u00e9gien, \u00e7a change quoi ?"},{"location":"%C3%89criture/Blog%20Centaure/Un%20ordinateur%20entre%20les%20mains%20d%27un%20coll%C3%A9gien%2C%20%C3%A7a%20change%20quoi%20%3F/#le-clavier","text":"M\u00eame si beaucoup de choses se font \u00e0 la souris, l'utilisation de ce \u00ab p\u00e9riph\u00e9rique \u00bb s'impose d\u00e8s les premiers instants.

L'application contenant un chat, c'est comme si en ouvrant le cahier de l'\u00e9l\u00e8ve, il y avait \u00e0 l'int\u00e9rieur une possibilit\u00e9 de communication entre les \u00e9l\u00e8ves et leur professeur . C'est d'ailleurs une belle fa\u00e7on de communiquer des documents. Fin des photocopies. C'est aussi un extraordinaire moyen de rattraper les cours que l'on a manqu\u00e9s.","title":"S'organiser"},{"location":"%C3%89criture/Blog%20Centaure/Un%20ordinateur%20entre%20les%20mains%20d%27un%20coll%C3%A9gien%2C%20%C3%A7a%20change%20quoi%20%3F/#le-rapport-au-cours","text":"La machine en main, le comportement des \u00e9l\u00e8ves en classe a compl\u00e8tement chang\u00e9.

Bref, si l'on n'a pas besoin de l'ordinateur, on le ferme. Je ne veux pas parler \u00e0 des \u00e9l\u00e8ves qui font autre chose. Mais quand ils notent (et il faut pr\u00e9ciser que nous avons r\u00e9ceptionn\u00e9 ces ordinateurs \u00e0 un moment o\u00f9 on faisait un travail tr\u00e8s classique de r\u00e9vision de la conjugaison), j'ai remarqu\u00e9 un surcro\u00eet d'attention . Habituellement, les \u00e9l\u00e8ves attendent que le malchanceux qui est au tableau ait fini d'\u00e9crire pour recopier. L\u00e0, ils notaient en m\u00eame temps. Ne risquant pas de raturer un r\u00e9sultat incorrect, ils pouvaient sur leur traitement de texte tout noter sans risque d'erreur et sans avoir \u00e0 recopier deux fois les choses (une fois au brouillon, une fois au propre). Ce ne sont l\u00e0 que quelques remarques, quelques observations rapides. Ce ne sont pas des pratiques num\u00e9riques extr\u00eamement d\u00e9velopp\u00e9es, mais les \u00e9l\u00e8ves ont eu le sentiment de d\u00e9couvrir une machine et des usages possibles auxquels ils n'avaient jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 confront\u00e9s, alors m\u00eame qu'ils sont des usagers depuis plusieurs ann\u00e9es.

Il y a tant \u00e0 faire pour cr\u00e9er cette culture num\u00e9rique qui n'appartient \u00e0 aucune mati\u00e8re et que parfois aucune mati\u00e8re ne saisit.","title":"Le rapport au cours"},{"location":"%C3%89criture/Blog%20Centaure/En%20lisant%20en%20%C3%A9crivant/Comment%20naquit%20la%20premi%C3%A8re%20lettre/","text":"Comment naquit la premi\u00e8re lettre \u29eb Il \u00e9tait une fois il y a tr\u00e8s longtemps un Homme N\u00e9olithique. Ce n'\u00e9tait ni un Jute, ni un Angle, ni m\u00eame un Dravidien bien que cela e\u00fbt pu se faire, ma Mieux-Aim\u00e9e, mais peu importe. C'\u00e9tait un Primitif qui vivait dans une caverne et il portait peu de v\u00eatements, il ne savait pas lire, ne savait pas \u00e9crire et n'en avait nulle envie et il \u00e9tait toujours heureux, sauf quand il avait faim. Il se nommait Tegumai Bopsulai, ce qui signifie : \u00ab L'Homme qui ne met pas un pied devant l'autre \u00e0 la va vite \u00bb ; mais nous, \u00f4 ma Mieux-Aim\u00e9e, nous l'appellerons Tegumai tout court. Et sa femme se nommait Teshumai Tewindrow, ce qui signifie : \u00ab La Dame qui pose tant et tant de questions \u00bb ; mais nous, \u00f4 ma Mieux-Aim\u00e9e, nous l'appellerons Teshumai tout court. Et sa petite fille ch\u00e9rie se nommait Taffimai Metallumai, ce qui signifie : \u00ab La-Petite-Personne-sans-mani\u00e8res-qui-m\u00e9riterait-une-bonne-fess\u00e9e \u00bb ; mais je l'appellerai Taffy. C'\u00e9tait la Mieux-Aim\u00e9e de Tegumai Bopsulai et la Mieux-Aim\u00e9e de sa Maman, et elle ne recevait pas la moiti\u00e9 des fess\u00e9es qu'elle m\u00e9ritait ; et ils vivaient tr\u00e8s heureux tous les trois. D\u00e8s que Taffy sut marcher, elle accompagna partout son Papa Tegumai et parfois ils ne rentraient \u00e0 la Caverne que lorsqu'ils avaient faim et alors Teshumai Tewindrow disait : \u2014 O\u00f9 diable \u00eates-vous all\u00e9s tous les deux pour vous salir ainsi ? Vraiment, mon Tegumai, tu ne vaux pas mieux que ma Taffy. Maintenant, fais attention et \u00e9coute. Un jour, Tegumai Bopsulai descendit par le marais-aux-castors jusqu'\u00e0 la rivi\u00e8re Wagai p\u00eacher des carpes pour le d\u00eener. Taffy l'accompagnait. Le harpon de Tegumai \u00e9tait en bois avec des dents de requin au bout et avant d'avoir pris un seul poisson, il le cassa net par accident en l'enfon\u00e7ant trop fort au fond de la rivi\u00e8re. Ils se trouvaient \u00e0 des miles et des miles de chez eux (bien s\u00fbr ils avaient emport\u00e9 leur d\u00e9jeuner dans un petit sac) et Tegumai avait oubli\u00e9 de prendre des harpons de rechange. \u2014 La p\u00eache est cuite ! dit Tegumai. Il va me falloir une demi-journ\u00e9e pour le r\u00e9parer. \u2014 Tu as ton grand harpon noir \u00e0 la maison, dit Taffy. Laisse-moi retourner en vitesse \u00e0 la caverne pour le demander \u00e0 Maman. \u2014 C'est trop loin pour tes petites jambes potel\u00e9es, dit Tegumai. Et puis, tu risques de tomber dans le marais-aux-castors et de te noyer. Il faut faire contre mauvaise fortune bon c\u0153ur. Il s'assit, prit une petite sacoche de peau pleine de nerfs de renne, de lani\u00e8res de cuir, de blocs de cire et de r\u00e9sine, et il se mit \u00e0 r\u00e9parer le harpon. Taffy s'assit \u00e9galement, les doigts de pied dans l'eau et le menton dans la main, en r\u00e9fl\u00e9chissant tr\u00e8s fort. Puis elle dit : \u2014 Dis donc, Papa, c'est vachement bisquant que nous ne sachions pas \u00e9crire, ni toi ni moi, tu ne trouves pas ? Sinon, nous pourrions envoyer un message pour demander le harpon. \u2014 Taffy, dit Tegumai. Combien de fois t'ai-je interdit de parler ainsi. On ne dit pas \u00ab vachement \u00bb, mais puisque tu en parles, ce serait en effet tr\u00e8s pratique si nous pouvions \u00e9crire \u00e0 la maison. C'est alors qu'un \u00c9tranger passa le long de la rivi\u00e8re, mais il appartenait \u00e0 une tribu lointaine, les Tewaras, et il ne comprenait pas un mot du langage de Tegumai. Il resta debout sur la rive en souriant \u00e0 Taffy car il avait lui aussi une petite fille ch\u00e9rie \u00e0 la maison. Tegumai tira de sa sacoche un \u00e9cheveau de nerfs de renne et se mit \u00e0 r\u00e9parer son harpon. \u2014 Venez ici, dit Taffy. Savez-vous o\u00f9 habite Maman ? Et l'\u00c9tranger dit \u00ab Hum \u00bb, \u00e9tant, comme tu sais, un Tewara. \u2014 Zut ! dit Taffy en tapant du pied, car elle vit un banc de belles grosses carpes remonter la rivi\u00e8re juste au moment o\u00f9 son Papa ne pouvait pas se servir de son harpon. \u2014 N'ennuie pas les grandes personnes, dit Tegumai, tellement occup\u00e9 \u00e0 r\u00e9parer son harpon qu'il ne se retourna m\u00eame pas. \u2014 Je l'ennuie pas, dit Taffy. Je voudrais seulement qu'il fasse ce que je voudrais qu'il fasse et il ne veut pas comprendre. \u2014 Alors ne m'ennuie pas, dit Tegumai en s'\u00e9vertuant \u00e0 tirer sur les nerfs de renne, la bouche pleine de petits bouts. L'\u00c9tranger, un authentique Tewara, s'assit dans l'herbe et Taffy lui montra ce que faisait son p\u00e8re. L'Etranger pensa : \u00ab Voici une enfant tr\u00e8s prodigieuse. Elle tape du pied et elle me fait des grimaces. Ce doit \u00eatre la fille de ce noble Chef, si grand qu'il ne me remarque m\u00eame pas. \u00bb Alors il sourit plus poliment que jamais. \u2014 Maintenant, dit Taffy, je voudrais que tu ailles trouver ma Maman car tu as les jambes plus longues que les miennes et tu ne tomberas pas dans le marais-aux-castors. Tu lui demanderas l'autre harpon de Papa, celui au manche noir qui est accroch\u00e9 au-dessus de notre chemin\u00e9e. L'\u00c9tranger (Tewara) pensa : \u00ab Voici une enfant tr\u00e8s tr\u00e8s prodigieuse. Elle agite les bras et elle me crie dessus, mais je ne comprends pas un mot de ce qu'elle dit. Pourtant, si je ne fais pas ce qu'elle veut, je crains fort que ce Chef hautain, l'Homme-qui-tourne-le-dos-aux-visiteurs, ne se f\u00e2che. \u00bb Il se leva et arracha un grand morceau d'\u00e9corce de bouleau et le tendit \u00e0 Taffy. Il fit cela, ma Mieux-Aim\u00e9e, pour montrer que son c\u0153ur \u00e9tait aussi blanc que l'\u00e9corce du bouleau et qu'il ne lui voulait aucun mal, mais Taffy ne comprit pas tr\u00e8s bien. \u2014 Oh ! dit-elle. Je vois \u00e0 pr\u00e9sent. Vous voulez l'adresse du domicile de ma Maman ? Bien s\u00fbr, je ne sais pas \u00e9crire, mais je pourrais dessiner si j'avais quelque chose de pointu pour gratter. Pr\u00eatez-moi, s'il vous pla\u00eet, la dent de requin accroch\u00e9e \u00e0 votre collier. L'\u00c9tranger (un Tewara) ne dit rien, alors Taffy tendit sa petite main et tira sur le beau collier de perles, de graines et de dents de requin autour de son cou. L'\u00c9tranger (c'\u00e9tait un Tewara) pensa : \u00ab Voici une enfant tr\u00e8s tr\u00e8s prodigieuse. Cette dent de requin est une dent de requin magique et on m'a toujours dit que celui qui la toucherait sans mon autorisation se mettrait aussit\u00f4t \u00e0 enfler ou \u00e9claterait. Mais cette enfant n'enfle ni n'\u00e9clate et ce puissant Chef, l'Homme-qui-s'occupe-seulement-de-ses-affaires, et qui n'a pas encore fait attention \u00e0 moi, ne semble pas craindre qu'elle enfle ou \u00e9clate. Je ferais bien d'\u00eatre plus poli. \u00bb Alors il donna la dent de requin \u00e0 Taffy et elle s'allongea \u00e0 plat ventre jambes en l'air, comme certaines personnes sur le parquet du salon lorsqu'elles veulent dessiner, et elle dit : \u2014 Je vais vous faire un beau dessin ! Vous pouvez regarder par-dessus mon \u00e9paule, mais il ne faut pas bouger. Je vais d'abord dessiner Papa en train de p\u00eacher. Ce n'est pas tr\u00e8s ressemblant, mais Maman comprendra car j'ai dessin\u00e9 son harpon bris\u00e9. Maintenant, je vais dessiner l'autre harpon qu'il veut, celui au manche noir. On dirait qu'il est plant\u00e9 dans le dos de Papa, mais c'est parce que la dent de requin a gliss\u00e9 et ce morceau d'\u00e9corce n'est pas assez grand. Voil\u00e0 le harpon que vous devez rapporter, alors je vais me dessiner en train de tout vous expliquer. En vrai, mes cheveux ne sont pas dress\u00e9s comme \u00e7a, mais c'est plus facile \u00e0 dessiner de cette mani\u00e8re. Maintenant, je vais vous dessiner. Moi, je vous trouve vraiment tr\u00e8s gentil mais je ne peux pas vous faire joli sur le dessin. Vous f\u00e2chez pas. Vous \u00eates f\u00e2ch\u00e9 ? L'\u00c9tranger (un Tewara, c'\u00e9tait) sourit. Il pensa : \u00ab Il va certainement y avoir une grande bataille quelque part et cette enfant extraordinaire qui m'a pris ma dent de requin magique sans enfler ni \u00e9clater, me demande d'appeler toute la tribu du grand Chef \u00e0 son secours. C'est un grand Chef, \u00e0 coup s\u00fbr, sinon il aurait fait attention \u00e0 moi. \u00bb \u2014 Regardez, dit Taffy en appuyant fort et en gribouillant pas mal. Je vous ai dessin\u00e9 et j'ai mis dans votre main le harpon que veut Papa pour vous rappeler qu'il faut le rapporter. Maintenant, je vais vous montrer comment trouver l'adresse du domicile de ma Maman. On va tout droit jusqu'aux deux arbres (\u00e7a, ce sont des arbres), puis on arrive \u00e0 un marais plein de castors. Je n'ai pas mis tous les castors car je ne sais pas dessiner les castors, mais j'ai dessin\u00e9 leurs t\u00eates et c'est tout ce qu'on voit en passant par le marais. Attention de ne pas tomber dedans ! Notre Caverne est juste derri\u00e8re le marais-aux-castors. En vrai, elle n'est pas aussi haute que la colline, mais je ne sais pas dessiner les choses toutes petites. Voici ma Maman devant la Caverne. Elle est belle. C'est la tr\u00e8s plus belle Maman qui ait jamais exist\u00e9, mais elle ne sera pas f\u00e2ch\u00e9e que je l'ai faite si vilaine. Elle sera fi\u00e8re de voir que je sais dessiner. Au cas o\u00f9 vous oublieriez, j'ai dessin\u00e9 le harpon que Papa veut en dehors de notre Caverne. En vrai, il est dedans, mais vous montrerez le dessin \u00e0 Maman et elle vous le donnera. Je l'ai faite avec les bras lev\u00e9s car je sais qu'elle sera contente de vous voir. C'est pas un beau dessin ? Vous avez tout compris ou bien je dois encore vous expliquer ? L'\u00c9tranger (Tewara, qu'il \u00e9tait) regarda le dessin et hocha la t\u00eate tr\u00e8s fort. Il se dit : \u00ab Si je ne vais pas chercher la tribu de ce grand Chef pour l'aider, il sera tu\u00e9 par ses ennemis qui arrivent de partout avec des lances. Je comprends maintenant pourquoi le grand Chef faisait mine de ne pas me voir ! Il craignait que ses ennemis ne soient cach\u00e9s dans les fourr\u00e9s et ne le voient me donner un message. Il m'a donc tourn\u00e9 le dos afin de laisser cette sage et prodigieuse enfant dessiner cette image terrifiante pour m'expliquer ses ennuis. Je vais aller chercher l'aide de sa tribu. \u00bb Sans m\u00eame demander son chemin \u00e0 Taffy, il partit comme le vent dans les buissons en tenant l'\u00e9corce de bouleau, et Taffy se rassit, toute contente. \u2014 Que faisais-tu, Taffy ? dit Tegumai. Il avait ramend\u00e9 son harpon et le balan\u00e7ait avec soin d'avant en arri\u00e8re. \u2014 Une petite id\u00e9e \u00e0 moi, Papa ch\u00e9ri, dit Taffy. Si tu ne poses pas de questions, tu sauras tout bient\u00f4t et tu auras une surprise. Tu ne te doutes pas \u00e0 quel point tu vas \u00eatre surpris, Papa ! Promets-moi que tu vas \u00eatre surpris. \u2014 Tr\u00e8s bien, dit Tegumai, et il continua de p\u00eacher. L'\u00c9tranger \u2014 sais-tu que c'\u00e9tait un Tewara ? \u2014 partit comme une fl\u00e8che avec le dessin et, apr\u00e8s avoir couru pendant plusieurs miles, il tomba tout \u00e0 fait par hasard sur Teshumai Tewindrow, \u00e0 la porte de sa Caverne, bavardant avec d'autres Dames N\u00e9olithiques convi\u00e9es \u00e0 un d\u00e9jeuner Primitif. Taffy ressemblait beaucoup \u00e0 Teshumai, surtout le haut du visage et les yeux, de sorte que l'\u00c9tranger, qui \u00e9tait toujours un pur Tewara, sourit poliment et tendit \u00e0 Teshumai l'\u00e9corce de bouleau. Il avait tellement couru qu'il \u00e9tait essouffl\u00e9 et ses jambes \u00e9taient toutes \u00e9gratign\u00e9es par les ronces, mais il s'effor\u00e7ait tout de m\u00eame d'\u00eatre poli. D\u00e8s qu'elle vit le dessin, Teshumai se mit \u00e0 hurler comme une folle en sautant sur l'\u00c9tranger. Les autres Dames N\u00e9olithiques le jet\u00e8rent imm\u00e9diatement au sol, puis elles s'assirent sur lui en rang par six, tandis que Teshumai lui tirait les cheveux. \u2014 C'est aussi clair que le nez au milieu du visage de cet \u00c9tranger, dit-elle. Il a cribl\u00e9 mon Tegumai de harpons et il a effray\u00e9 la petite Taffy au point de lui faire dresser les cheveux sur la t\u00eate, et non content de cela, il m'apporte un horrible dessin qui explique ce qui s'est pass\u00e9. Regardez ! Elle montra le dessin \u00e0 toutes les Dames N\u00e9olithiques patiemment assises sur l'\u00c9tranger. \u2014 Voici mon Tegumai avec un bras cass\u00e9 ; voici un harpon enfonc\u00e9 dans son dos ; voici un homme pr\u00eat \u00e0 lancer un harpon ; en voici un autre qui lance un harpon depuis une Caverne et voici un groupe de gens (il s'agissait en fait des castors de Taffy, mais ils ressemblaient vraiment \u00e0 des gens) qui arrivent derri\u00e8re Tegumai. C'est-y-pas-affreux ? \u2014 Absolument affreux ! dirent les Dames N\u00e9olithiques. Puis elles couvrirent de boue les cheveux de l'\u00c9tranger (ce qui le surprit) et elles tap\u00e8rent sur les Tambours Tribaux R\u00e9sonnants et rassembl\u00e8rent tous les Chefs de la Tribu de Tegumai avec leurs Hetmans et leurs Dolmans, tous des Negus, des Woons, des Akhoonds de l'organisation, en plus des Sorciers, F\u00e9ticheurs, Hommes-m\u00e9decine, et Bonzes et de tous les autres, qui demand\u00e8rent \u00e0 l'\u00c9tranger, avant de lui couper la t\u00eate, de les accompagner jusqu'\u00e0 la rivi\u00e8re pour leur montrer o\u00f9 il avait cach\u00e9 la pauvre Taffy. \u00c0 cet instant, l'Etranger (bien qu'il f\u00fbt un Tewara) se trouva bien ennuy\u00e9. Ses cheveux \u00e9taient coll\u00e9s par la boue, on l'avait roul\u00e9 dans tous les sens sur des cailloux pointus, on s'\u00e9tait assis sur lui en rang par six, on l'avait tap\u00e9 et tabass\u00e9 \u00e0 lui en couper le souffle, et bien qu'il ne compr\u00eet pas leur langage, il \u00e9tait presque certain que les noms dont le traitaient les Dames N\u00e9olithiques n'\u00e9taient pas tr\u00e8s distingu\u00e9s. Pourtant, il ne dit rien avant que toute la Tribu de Tegumai soit r\u00e9unie, puis il les conduisit jusqu'au bord de la rivi\u00e8re Wagai, et l\u00e0 ils trouv\u00e8rent Taffy en train d'effeuiller des marguerites tandis que Tegumai harponnait soigneusement des petites carpes avec son harpon ramend\u00e9. \u2014 Eh bien, vous avez fait vite ! dit Taffy. Mais pourquoi avez-vous amen\u00e9 tous ces gens ? Papa ch\u00e9ri, voil\u00e0 ma surprise. Tu es surpris, Papa ? \u2014 Tr\u00e8s, dit Tegumai. Mais plus question de p\u00eacher aujourd'hui. \u00c7a alors ! Taffy, voil\u00e0 toute cette ch\u00e8re, bonne, brave Tribu, propre et tranquille. De fait, ils \u00e9taient tous l\u00e0. \u00c0 leur t\u00eate marchaient Teshumai Tewindrow et les Dames N\u00e9olithiques, tenant fermement l'\u00c9tranger dont les cheveux \u00e9taient pleins de boue (bien qu'il f\u00fbt un Tewara). Puis venaient le Chef Principal, le Vice-Chef, le Sous-Chef et les Chefs Assistants (tous arm\u00e9s jusqu'aux dents du haut), les Hetmans et les Centurions, des Platoffs avec leurs Pelotons et des Dolmans avec leurs D\u00e9tachements ; des Woons, des Negus et des Akhoonds au second plan (eux aussi arm\u00e9s jusqu'aux dents). Derri\u00e8re eux, toute la Tribu \u00e9tait class\u00e9e par ordre hi\u00e9rarchique, d'abord les propri\u00e9taires de quatre cavernes (une pour chaque saison), d'un \u00e9levage de rennes priv\u00e9 et de deux \u00e9levages de saumons, puis les Vilains f\u00e9odaux et prognathes, qui ont \u00e0 moiti\u00e9 droit \u00e0 une moiti\u00e9 de peau d'ours les nuits d'hiver, \u00e0 sept aunes du feu, et enfin les serfs inf\u00e9od\u00e9s, titulaires de la rente r\u00e9versible d'un os \u00e0 moelle bien gratt\u00e9 sur le droit du meilleur chatel. (Ne trouves-tu pas tous ces mots charmants, ma Mieux-Aim\u00e9e ?) Ils \u00e9taient tous l\u00e0, tr\u00e9pignant et hurlant, et ils effray\u00e8rent tous les poissons \u00e0 vingt miles \u00e0 la ronde. Tegumai les remercia par un discours N\u00e9olithique fluide. Alors Teshumai Tewindrow se pr\u00e9cipita pour embrasser Taffy en la serrant tr\u00e8s fort dans ses bras, mais le Chef Principal de la Tribu de Tegumai prit Tegumai par les plumes de son aigrette et le secoua brutalement. \u2014 Explique ! Explique ! Explique ! cria toute la Tribu de Tegumai. \u2014 Pour l'amour du ciel, dit Tegumai, l\u00e2chez mon aigrette. On ne peut donc pas briser son harpon sans que tout le pays vous tombe dessus ? Vous \u00eates des gens bien importuns ! \u2014 Je vois que vous n'avez m\u00eame pas apport\u00e9 le harpon \u00e0 manche noir de mon Papa, dit Taffy. Et que faites-vous \u00e0 mon gentil \u00c9tranger ? Ils le cognaient \u00e0 deux, \u00e0 trois, \u00e0 dix, ce qui lui faisait ribouler des yeux. Il ne pouvait que hoqueter et d\u00e9signer Taffy du doigt. \u2014 O\u00f9 sont les m\u00e9chants qui t'ont frapp\u00e9 \u00e0 coups de harpons, mon ch\u00e9ri ? dit Teshumai Tewindrow. \u2014 Il n'y a eu personne, dit Tegumai. Mon seul visiteur ce matin a \u00e9t\u00e9 ce pauvre bougre que vous tentez d'\u00e9touffer. N'\u00eates-vous pas bien ou alors \u00eates-vous malades, \u00f4 Tribu de Tegumai ? \u2014 Il est arriv\u00e9 avec un horrible dessin, dit le Chef Principal. Un dessin qui te montrait cribl\u00e9 de harpons. \u2014 Euh\u2026 Mmm\u2026 P't-\u00eatre que j'ferais mieux d'expliquer que c'est moi qui lui ai donn\u00e9 ce dessin, dit Taffy qui ne se sentait pas tr\u00e8s \u00e0 l'aise. \u2014 Toi ! dit en ch\u0153ur la Tribu de Tegumai. Petite-Personne-sans-mani\u00e8res-qui-m\u00e9riterait-une-bonne-fess\u00e9e ! Toi ? \u2014 Taffy, ma ch\u00e9rie, je crois que nous allons avoir de petits ennuis, dit son Papa. Et il passa son bras autour de ses \u00e9paules, alors \u00e7a lui \u00e9tait bien \u00e9gal. \u2014 Explique ! Explique ! Explique ! dit le Chef Principal de la Tribu de Tegumai. Et il sautait \u00e0 cloche-pied. \u2014 Je voulais que l'\u00c9tranger aille chercher le harpon de Papa alors je l'ai dessin\u00e9, dit Taffy. Y avait pas plusieurs harpons. Y en avait qu'un. Je l'ai dessin\u00e9 trois fois pour \u00eatre plus s\u00fbre. J'ai pas pu l'emp\u00eacher d'avoir l'air piqu\u00e9 dans la t\u00eate de Papa, y avait pas assez de place sur l'\u00e9corce de bouleau ; et ces choses que Maman a cru que c'\u00e9tait des gens m\u00e9chants, ce sont mes castors. Je les ai dessin\u00e9s pour lui indiquer le chemin \u00e0 travers les marais ; et j'ai dessin\u00e9 Maman \u00e0 l'entr\u00e9e de la Caverne, l'air ravi, car c'est un gentil \u00c9tranger et moi, je vous trouve les plus b\u00eates du monde, dit Taffy. C'est un homme tr\u00e8s gentil. Pourquoi lui avez-vous mis de la boue plein les cheveux ? Lavez-le ! \u00bb Personne ne dit rien pendant un long moment, puis le Chef Principal se mit \u00e0 rire ; puis l'\u00c9tranger (lui au moins c'\u00e9tait un Tewara) rit aussi ; puis Tegumai rit, si fort qu'il tomba \u00e0 plat sur la rive ; puis toute la Tribu rit encore, davantage, plus fort. Les seules personnes qui ne riaient pas, c'\u00e9tait Teshumai Tewindrow et les autres Dames N\u00e9olithiques. Elles furent tr\u00e8s polies envers leurs maris et r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e8rent \u00ab Idiot ! \u00bb je ne sais combien de fois. Alors le Chef Principal de la Tribu de Tegumai cria, dit et chanta : \u2014 \u00d4 Petite-Personne-sans-mani\u00e8res-qui-m\u00e9riterait-une-bonne-fess\u00e9e, tu as d\u00e9couvert une grande invention ! \u2014 Je ne l'ai pas fait expr\u00e8s ; je voulais seulement le harpon \u00e0 manche noir de Papa, dit Taffy. \u2014 Peu importe. C'est tout de m\u00eame une grande invention et un jour les hommes appelleront \u00e7a l'\u00e9criture. Pour l'instant ce ne sont que des dessins et comme nous avons pu le constater aujourd'hui, les dessins ne sont pas toujours bien compris. Mais un jour viendra, \u00f4 enfant de Tegumai, o\u00f9 nous ferons des lettres (vingt-six en tout) et o\u00f9 nous saurons lire et \u00e9crire. Alors nous dirons toujours exactement ce que nous aurons \u00e0 dire, sans aucune erreur. Que les Dames N\u00e9olithiques lavent les cheveux de l'\u00c9tranger ! \u2014 Eh bien, j'en suis ravie, dit Taffy, car apr\u00e8s tout, bien que vous ayez apport\u00e9 tous les harpons de la Tribu de Tegumai, vous avez oubli\u00e9 le harpon \u00e0 manche noir de mon Papa. Alors le Chef Principal cria, dit et chanta : \u2014 Ch\u00e8re Taffy, la prochaine fois que tu \u00e9criras une lettre dessin, confie-la plut\u00f4t \u00e0 un homme qui parle notre langue pour qu'il puisse en expliquer le sens. \u00c7a ne me g\u00eane pas car je suis le Chef Principal, mais c'est tr\u00e8s mauvais pour le reste de la Tribu de Tegumai et comme tu le vois, \u00e7a surprend les \u00e9trangers. Ils accueillirent l'\u00c9tranger (un authentique Tewara de Tewar) au sein de la Tribu de Tegumai car c'\u00e9tait un monsieur et il n'avait pas fait tout un plat de la boue que les Dames N\u00e9olithiques lui avaient mise dans les cheveux. Mais depuis ce jour (et ce doit \u00eatre \u00e0 cause de Taffy) tr\u00e8s peu de petites filles aiment apprendre \u00e0 lire et \u00e0 \u00e9crire. La plupart pr\u00e9f\u00e8rent dessiner ou jouer avec leurs Papas comme Taffy.","title":"Comment naquit la premi\u00e8re lettre"},{"location":"%C3%89criture/Blog%20Centaure/En%20lisant%20en%20%C3%A9crivant/Comment%20naquit%20la%20premi%C3%A8re%20lettre/#comment-naquit-la-premiere-lettre","text":"Il \u00e9tait une fois il y a tr\u00e8s longtemps un Homme N\u00e9olithique. Ce n'\u00e9tait ni un Jute, ni un Angle, ni m\u00eame un Dravidien bien que cela e\u00fbt pu se faire, ma Mieux-Aim\u00e9e, mais peu importe. C'\u00e9tait un Primitif qui vivait dans une caverne et il portait peu de v\u00eatements, il ne savait pas lire, ne savait pas \u00e9crire et n'en avait nulle envie et il \u00e9tait toujours heureux, sauf quand il avait faim. Il se nommait Tegumai Bopsulai, ce qui signifie : \u00ab L'Homme qui ne met pas un pied devant l'autre \u00e0 la va vite \u00bb ; mais nous, \u00f4 ma Mieux-Aim\u00e9e, nous l'appellerons Tegumai tout court. Et sa femme se nommait Teshumai Tewindrow, ce qui signifie : \u00ab La Dame qui pose tant et tant de questions \u00bb ; mais nous, \u00f4 ma Mieux-Aim\u00e9e, nous l'appellerons Teshumai tout court. Et sa petite fille ch\u00e9rie se nommait Taffimai Metallumai, ce qui signifie : \u00ab La-Petite-Personne-sans-mani\u00e8res-qui-m\u00e9riterait-une-bonne-fess\u00e9e \u00bb ; mais je l'appellerai Taffy. C'\u00e9tait la Mieux-Aim\u00e9e de Tegumai Bopsulai et la Mieux-Aim\u00e9e de sa Maman, et elle ne recevait pas la moiti\u00e9 des fess\u00e9es qu'elle m\u00e9ritait ; et ils vivaient tr\u00e8s heureux tous les trois. D\u00e8s que Taffy sut marcher, elle accompagna partout son Papa Tegumai et parfois ils ne rentraient \u00e0 la Caverne que lorsqu'ils avaient faim et alors Teshumai Tewindrow disait : \u2014 O\u00f9 diable \u00eates-vous all\u00e9s tous les deux pour vous salir ainsi ? Vraiment, mon Tegumai, tu ne vaux pas mieux que ma Taffy. Maintenant, fais attention et \u00e9coute. Un jour, Tegumai Bopsulai descendit par le marais-aux-castors jusqu'\u00e0 la rivi\u00e8re Wagai p\u00eacher des carpes pour le d\u00eener. Taffy l'accompagnait. Le harpon de Tegumai \u00e9tait en bois avec des dents de requin au bout et avant d'avoir pris un seul poisson, il le cassa net par accident en l'enfon\u00e7ant trop fort au fond de la rivi\u00e8re. Ils se trouvaient \u00e0 des miles et des miles de chez eux (bien s\u00fbr ils avaient emport\u00e9 leur d\u00e9jeuner dans un petit sac) et Tegumai avait oubli\u00e9 de prendre des harpons de rechange. \u2014 La p\u00eache est cuite ! dit Tegumai. Il va me falloir une demi-journ\u00e9e pour le r\u00e9parer. \u2014 Tu as ton grand harpon noir \u00e0 la maison, dit Taffy. Laisse-moi retourner en vitesse \u00e0 la caverne pour le demander \u00e0 Maman. \u2014 C'est trop loin pour tes petites jambes potel\u00e9es, dit Tegumai. Et puis, tu risques de tomber dans le marais-aux-castors et de te noyer. Il faut faire contre mauvaise fortune bon c\u0153ur. Il s'assit, prit une petite sacoche de peau pleine de nerfs de renne, de lani\u00e8res de cuir, de blocs de cire et de r\u00e9sine, et il se mit \u00e0 r\u00e9parer le harpon. Taffy s'assit \u00e9galement, les doigts de pied dans l'eau et le menton dans la main, en r\u00e9fl\u00e9chissant tr\u00e8s fort. Puis elle dit : \u2014 Dis donc, Papa, c'est vachement bisquant que nous ne sachions pas \u00e9crire, ni toi ni moi, tu ne trouves pas ? Sinon, nous pourrions envoyer un message pour demander le harpon. \u2014 Taffy, dit Tegumai. Combien de fois t'ai-je interdit de parler ainsi. On ne dit pas \u00ab vachement \u00bb, mais puisque tu en parles, ce serait en effet tr\u00e8s pratique si nous pouvions \u00e9crire \u00e0 la maison. C'est alors qu'un \u00c9tranger passa le long de la rivi\u00e8re, mais il appartenait \u00e0 une tribu lointaine, les Tewaras, et il ne comprenait pas un mot du langage de Tegumai. Il resta debout sur la rive en souriant \u00e0 Taffy car il avait lui aussi une petite fille ch\u00e9rie \u00e0 la maison. Tegumai tira de sa sacoche un \u00e9cheveau de nerfs de renne et se mit \u00e0 r\u00e9parer son harpon. \u2014 Venez ici, dit Taffy. Savez-vous o\u00f9 habite Maman ? Et l'\u00c9tranger dit \u00ab Hum \u00bb, \u00e9tant, comme tu sais, un Tewara. \u2014 Zut ! dit Taffy en tapant du pied, car elle vit un banc de belles grosses carpes remonter la rivi\u00e8re juste au moment o\u00f9 son Papa ne pouvait pas se servir de son harpon. \u2014 N'ennuie pas les grandes personnes, dit Tegumai, tellement occup\u00e9 \u00e0 r\u00e9parer son harpon qu'il ne se retourna m\u00eame pas. \u2014 Je l'ennuie pas, dit Taffy. Je voudrais seulement qu'il fasse ce que je voudrais qu'il fasse et il ne veut pas comprendre. \u2014 Alors ne m'ennuie pas, dit Tegumai en s'\u00e9vertuant \u00e0 tirer sur les nerfs de renne, la bouche pleine de petits bouts. L'\u00c9tranger, un authentique Tewara, s'assit dans l'herbe et Taffy lui montra ce que faisait son p\u00e8re. L'Etranger pensa : \u00ab Voici une enfant tr\u00e8s prodigieuse. Elle tape du pied et elle me fait des grimaces. Ce doit \u00eatre la fille de ce noble Chef, si grand qu'il ne me remarque m\u00eame pas. \u00bb Alors il sourit plus poliment que jamais. \u2014 Maintenant, dit Taffy, je voudrais que tu ailles trouver ma Maman car tu as les jambes plus longues que les miennes et tu ne tomberas pas dans le marais-aux-castors. Tu lui demanderas l'autre harpon de Papa, celui au manche noir qui est accroch\u00e9 au-dessus de notre chemin\u00e9e. L'\u00c9tranger (Tewara) pensa : \u00ab Voici une enfant tr\u00e8s tr\u00e8s prodigieuse. Elle agite les bras et elle me crie dessus, mais je ne comprends pas un mot de ce qu'elle dit. Pourtant, si je ne fais pas ce qu'elle veut, je crains fort que ce Chef hautain, l'Homme-qui-tourne-le-dos-aux-visiteurs, ne se f\u00e2che. \u00bb Il se leva et arracha un grand morceau d'\u00e9corce de bouleau et le tendit \u00e0 Taffy. Il fit cela, ma Mieux-Aim\u00e9e, pour montrer que son c\u0153ur \u00e9tait aussi blanc que l'\u00e9corce du bouleau et qu'il ne lui voulait aucun mal, mais Taffy ne comprit pas tr\u00e8s bien. \u2014 Oh ! dit-elle. Je vois \u00e0 pr\u00e9sent. Vous voulez l'adresse du domicile de ma Maman ? Bien s\u00fbr, je ne sais pas \u00e9crire, mais je pourrais dessiner si j'avais quelque chose de pointu pour gratter. Pr\u00eatez-moi, s'il vous pla\u00eet, la dent de requin accroch\u00e9e \u00e0 votre collier. L'\u00c9tranger (un Tewara) ne dit rien, alors Taffy tendit sa petite main et tira sur le beau collier de perles, de graines et de dents de requin autour de son cou. L'\u00c9tranger (c'\u00e9tait un Tewara) pensa : \u00ab Voici une enfant tr\u00e8s tr\u00e8s prodigieuse. Cette dent de requin est une dent de requin magique et on m'a toujours dit que celui qui la toucherait sans mon autorisation se mettrait aussit\u00f4t \u00e0 enfler ou \u00e9claterait. Mais cette enfant n'enfle ni n'\u00e9clate et ce puissant Chef, l'Homme-qui-s'occupe-seulement-de-ses-affaires, et qui n'a pas encore fait attention \u00e0 moi, ne semble pas craindre qu'elle enfle ou \u00e9clate. Je ferais bien d'\u00eatre plus poli. \u00bb Alors il donna la dent de requin \u00e0 Taffy et elle s'allongea \u00e0 plat ventre jambes en l'air, comme certaines personnes sur le parquet du salon lorsqu'elles veulent dessiner, et elle dit : \u2014 Je vais vous faire un beau dessin ! Vous pouvez regarder par-dessus mon \u00e9paule, mais il ne faut pas bouger. Je vais d'abord dessiner Papa en train de p\u00eacher. Ce n'est pas tr\u00e8s ressemblant, mais Maman comprendra car j'ai dessin\u00e9 son harpon bris\u00e9. Maintenant, je vais dessiner l'autre harpon qu'il veut, celui au manche noir. On dirait qu'il est plant\u00e9 dans le dos de Papa, mais c'est parce que la dent de requin a gliss\u00e9 et ce morceau d'\u00e9corce n'est pas assez grand. Voil\u00e0 le harpon que vous devez rapporter, alors je vais me dessiner en train de tout vous expliquer. En vrai, mes cheveux ne sont pas dress\u00e9s comme \u00e7a, mais c'est plus facile \u00e0 dessiner de cette mani\u00e8re. Maintenant, je vais vous dessiner. Moi, je vous trouve vraiment tr\u00e8s gentil mais je ne peux pas vous faire joli sur le dessin. Vous f\u00e2chez pas. Vous \u00eates f\u00e2ch\u00e9 ? L'\u00c9tranger (un Tewara, c'\u00e9tait) sourit. Il pensa : \u00ab Il va certainement y avoir une grande bataille quelque part et cette enfant extraordinaire qui m'a pris ma dent de requin magique sans enfler ni \u00e9clater, me demande d'appeler toute la tribu du grand Chef \u00e0 son secours. C'est un grand Chef, \u00e0 coup s\u00fbr, sinon il aurait fait attention \u00e0 moi. \u00bb \u2014 Regardez, dit Taffy en appuyant fort et en gribouillant pas mal. Je vous ai dessin\u00e9 et j'ai mis dans votre main le harpon que veut Papa pour vous rappeler qu'il faut le rapporter. Maintenant, je vais vous montrer comment trouver l'adresse du domicile de ma Maman. On va tout droit jusqu'aux deux arbres (\u00e7a, ce sont des arbres), puis on arrive \u00e0 un marais plein de castors. Je n'ai pas mis tous les castors car je ne sais pas dessiner les castors, mais j'ai dessin\u00e9 leurs t\u00eates et c'est tout ce qu'on voit en passant par le marais. Attention de ne pas tomber dedans ! Notre Caverne est juste derri\u00e8re le marais-aux-castors. En vrai, elle n'est pas aussi haute que la colline, mais je ne sais pas dessiner les choses toutes petites. Voici ma Maman devant la Caverne. Elle est belle. C'est la tr\u00e8s plus belle Maman qui ait jamais exist\u00e9, mais elle ne sera pas f\u00e2ch\u00e9e que je l'ai faite si vilaine. Elle sera fi\u00e8re de voir que je sais dessiner. Au cas o\u00f9 vous oublieriez, j'ai dessin\u00e9 le harpon que Papa veut en dehors de notre Caverne. En vrai, il est dedans, mais vous montrerez le dessin \u00e0 Maman et elle vous le donnera. Je l'ai faite avec les bras lev\u00e9s car je sais qu'elle sera contente de vous voir. C'est pas un beau dessin ? Vous avez tout compris ou bien je dois encore vous expliquer ? L'\u00c9tranger (Tewara, qu'il \u00e9tait) regarda le dessin et hocha la t\u00eate tr\u00e8s fort. Il se dit : \u00ab Si je ne vais pas chercher la tribu de ce grand Chef pour l'aider, il sera tu\u00e9 par ses ennemis qui arrivent de partout avec des lances. Je comprends maintenant pourquoi le grand Chef faisait mine de ne pas me voir ! Il craignait que ses ennemis ne soient cach\u00e9s dans les fourr\u00e9s et ne le voient me donner un message. Il m'a donc tourn\u00e9 le dos afin de laisser cette sage et prodigieuse enfant dessiner cette image terrifiante pour m'expliquer ses ennuis. Je vais aller chercher l'aide de sa tribu. \u00bb Sans m\u00eame demander son chemin \u00e0 Taffy, il partit comme le vent dans les buissons en tenant l'\u00e9corce de bouleau, et Taffy se rassit, toute contente. \u2014 Que faisais-tu, Taffy ? dit Tegumai. Il avait ramend\u00e9 son harpon et le balan\u00e7ait avec soin d'avant en arri\u00e8re. \u2014 Une petite id\u00e9e \u00e0 moi, Papa ch\u00e9ri, dit Taffy. Si tu ne poses pas de questions, tu sauras tout bient\u00f4t et tu auras une surprise. Tu ne te doutes pas \u00e0 quel point tu vas \u00eatre surpris, Papa ! Promets-moi que tu vas \u00eatre surpris. \u2014 Tr\u00e8s bien, dit Tegumai, et il continua de p\u00eacher. L'\u00c9tranger \u2014 sais-tu que c'\u00e9tait un Tewara ? \u2014 partit comme une fl\u00e8che avec le dessin et, apr\u00e8s avoir couru pendant plusieurs miles, il tomba tout \u00e0 fait par hasard sur Teshumai Tewindrow, \u00e0 la porte de sa Caverne, bavardant avec d'autres Dames N\u00e9olithiques convi\u00e9es \u00e0 un d\u00e9jeuner Primitif. Taffy ressemblait beaucoup \u00e0 Teshumai, surtout le haut du visage et les yeux, de sorte que l'\u00c9tranger, qui \u00e9tait toujours un pur Tewara, sourit poliment et tendit \u00e0 Teshumai l'\u00e9corce de bouleau. Il avait tellement couru qu'il \u00e9tait essouffl\u00e9 et ses jambes \u00e9taient toutes \u00e9gratign\u00e9es par les ronces, mais il s'effor\u00e7ait tout de m\u00eame d'\u00eatre poli. D\u00e8s qu'elle vit le dessin, Teshumai se mit \u00e0 hurler comme une folle en sautant sur l'\u00c9tranger. Les autres Dames N\u00e9olithiques le jet\u00e8rent imm\u00e9diatement au sol, puis elles s'assirent sur lui en rang par six, tandis que Teshumai lui tirait les cheveux. \u2014 C'est aussi clair que le nez au milieu du visage de cet \u00c9tranger, dit-elle. Il a cribl\u00e9 mon Tegumai de harpons et il a effray\u00e9 la petite Taffy au point de lui faire dresser les cheveux sur la t\u00eate, et non content de cela, il m'apporte un horrible dessin qui explique ce qui s'est pass\u00e9. Regardez ! Elle montra le dessin \u00e0 toutes les Dames N\u00e9olithiques patiemment assises sur l'\u00c9tranger. \u2014 Voici mon Tegumai avec un bras cass\u00e9 ; voici un harpon enfonc\u00e9 dans son dos ; voici un homme pr\u00eat \u00e0 lancer un harpon ; en voici un autre qui lance un harpon depuis une Caverne et voici un groupe de gens (il s'agissait en fait des castors de Taffy, mais ils ressemblaient vraiment \u00e0 des gens) qui arrivent derri\u00e8re Tegumai. C'est-y-pas-affreux ? \u2014 Absolument affreux ! dirent les Dames N\u00e9olithiques. Puis elles couvrirent de boue les cheveux de l'\u00c9tranger (ce qui le surprit) et elles tap\u00e8rent sur les Tambours Tribaux R\u00e9sonnants et rassembl\u00e8rent tous les Chefs de la Tribu de Tegumai avec leurs Hetmans et leurs Dolmans, tous des Negus, des Woons, des Akhoonds de l'organisation, en plus des Sorciers, F\u00e9ticheurs, Hommes-m\u00e9decine, et Bonzes et de tous les autres, qui demand\u00e8rent \u00e0 l'\u00c9tranger, avant de lui couper la t\u00eate, de les accompagner jusqu'\u00e0 la rivi\u00e8re pour leur montrer o\u00f9 il avait cach\u00e9 la pauvre Taffy. \u00c0 cet instant, l'Etranger (bien qu'il f\u00fbt un Tewara) se trouva bien ennuy\u00e9. Ses cheveux \u00e9taient coll\u00e9s par la boue, on l'avait roul\u00e9 dans tous les sens sur des cailloux pointus, on s'\u00e9tait assis sur lui en rang par six, on l'avait tap\u00e9 et tabass\u00e9 \u00e0 lui en couper le souffle, et bien qu'il ne compr\u00eet pas leur langage, il \u00e9tait presque certain que les noms dont le traitaient les Dames N\u00e9olithiques n'\u00e9taient pas tr\u00e8s distingu\u00e9s. Pourtant, il ne dit rien avant que toute la Tribu de Tegumai soit r\u00e9unie, puis il les conduisit jusqu'au bord de la rivi\u00e8re Wagai, et l\u00e0 ils trouv\u00e8rent Taffy en train d'effeuiller des marguerites tandis que Tegumai harponnait soigneusement des petites carpes avec son harpon ramend\u00e9. \u2014 Eh bien, vous avez fait vite ! dit Taffy. Mais pourquoi avez-vous amen\u00e9 tous ces gens ? Papa ch\u00e9ri, voil\u00e0 ma surprise. Tu es surpris, Papa ? \u2014 Tr\u00e8s, dit Tegumai. Mais plus question de p\u00eacher aujourd'hui. \u00c7a alors ! Taffy, voil\u00e0 toute cette ch\u00e8re, bonne, brave Tribu, propre et tranquille. De fait, ils \u00e9taient tous l\u00e0. \u00c0 leur t\u00eate marchaient Teshumai Tewindrow et les Dames N\u00e9olithiques, tenant fermement l'\u00c9tranger dont les cheveux \u00e9taient pleins de boue (bien qu'il f\u00fbt un Tewara). Puis venaient le Chef Principal, le Vice-Chef, le Sous-Chef et les Chefs Assistants (tous arm\u00e9s jusqu'aux dents du haut), les Hetmans et les Centurions, des Platoffs avec leurs Pelotons et des Dolmans avec leurs D\u00e9tachements ; des Woons, des Negus et des Akhoonds au second plan (eux aussi arm\u00e9s jusqu'aux dents). Derri\u00e8re eux, toute la Tribu \u00e9tait class\u00e9e par ordre hi\u00e9rarchique, d'abord les propri\u00e9taires de quatre cavernes (une pour chaque saison), d'un \u00e9levage de rennes priv\u00e9 et de deux \u00e9levages de saumons, puis les Vilains f\u00e9odaux et prognathes, qui ont \u00e0 moiti\u00e9 droit \u00e0 une moiti\u00e9 de peau d'ours les nuits d'hiver, \u00e0 sept aunes du feu, et enfin les serfs inf\u00e9od\u00e9s, titulaires de la rente r\u00e9versible d'un os \u00e0 moelle bien gratt\u00e9 sur le droit du meilleur chatel. (Ne trouves-tu pas tous ces mots charmants, ma Mieux-Aim\u00e9e ?) Ils \u00e9taient tous l\u00e0, tr\u00e9pignant et hurlant, et ils effray\u00e8rent tous les poissons \u00e0 vingt miles \u00e0 la ronde. Tegumai les remercia par un discours N\u00e9olithique fluide. Alors Teshumai Tewindrow se pr\u00e9cipita pour embrasser Taffy en la serrant tr\u00e8s fort dans ses bras, mais le Chef Principal de la Tribu de Tegumai prit Tegumai par les plumes de son aigrette et le secoua brutalement. \u2014 Explique ! Explique ! Explique ! cria toute la Tribu de Tegumai. \u2014 Pour l'amour du ciel, dit Tegumai, l\u00e2chez mon aigrette. On ne peut donc pas briser son harpon sans que tout le pays vous tombe dessus ? Vous \u00eates des gens bien importuns ! \u2014 Je vois que vous n'avez m\u00eame pas apport\u00e9 le harpon \u00e0 manche noir de mon Papa, dit Taffy. Et que faites-vous \u00e0 mon gentil \u00c9tranger ? Ils le cognaient \u00e0 deux, \u00e0 trois, \u00e0 dix, ce qui lui faisait ribouler des yeux. Il ne pouvait que hoqueter et d\u00e9signer Taffy du doigt. \u2014 O\u00f9 sont les m\u00e9chants qui t'ont frapp\u00e9 \u00e0 coups de harpons, mon ch\u00e9ri ? dit Teshumai Tewindrow. \u2014 Il n'y a eu personne, dit Tegumai. Mon seul visiteur ce matin a \u00e9t\u00e9 ce pauvre bougre que vous tentez d'\u00e9touffer. N'\u00eates-vous pas bien ou alors \u00eates-vous malades, \u00f4 Tribu de Tegumai ? \u2014 Il est arriv\u00e9 avec un horrible dessin, dit le Chef Principal. Un dessin qui te montrait cribl\u00e9 de harpons. \u2014 Euh\u2026 Mmm\u2026 P't-\u00eatre que j'ferais mieux d'expliquer que c'est moi qui lui ai donn\u00e9 ce dessin, dit Taffy qui ne se sentait pas tr\u00e8s \u00e0 l'aise. \u2014 Toi ! dit en ch\u0153ur la Tribu de Tegumai. Petite-Personne-sans-mani\u00e8res-qui-m\u00e9riterait-une-bonne-fess\u00e9e ! Toi ? \u2014 Taffy, ma ch\u00e9rie, je crois que nous allons avoir de petits ennuis, dit son Papa. Et il passa son bras autour de ses \u00e9paules, alors \u00e7a lui \u00e9tait bien \u00e9gal. \u2014 Explique ! Explique ! Explique ! dit le Chef Principal de la Tribu de Tegumai. Et il sautait \u00e0 cloche-pied. \u2014 Je voulais que l'\u00c9tranger aille chercher le harpon de Papa alors je l'ai dessin\u00e9, dit Taffy. Y avait pas plusieurs harpons. Y en avait qu'un. Je l'ai dessin\u00e9 trois fois pour \u00eatre plus s\u00fbre. J'ai pas pu l'emp\u00eacher d'avoir l'air piqu\u00e9 dans la t\u00eate de Papa, y avait pas assez de place sur l'\u00e9corce de bouleau ; et ces choses que Maman a cru que c'\u00e9tait des gens m\u00e9chants, ce sont mes castors. Je les ai dessin\u00e9s pour lui indiquer le chemin \u00e0 travers les marais ; et j'ai dessin\u00e9 Maman \u00e0 l'entr\u00e9e de la Caverne, l'air ravi, car c'est un gentil \u00c9tranger et moi, je vous trouve les plus b\u00eates du monde, dit Taffy. C'est un homme tr\u00e8s gentil. Pourquoi lui avez-vous mis de la boue plein les cheveux ? Lavez-le ! \u00bb Personne ne dit rien pendant un long moment, puis le Chef Principal se mit \u00e0 rire ; puis l'\u00c9tranger (lui au moins c'\u00e9tait un Tewara) rit aussi ; puis Tegumai rit, si fort qu'il tomba \u00e0 plat sur la rive ; puis toute la Tribu rit encore, davantage, plus fort. Les seules personnes qui ne riaient pas, c'\u00e9tait Teshumai Tewindrow et les autres Dames N\u00e9olithiques. Elles furent tr\u00e8s polies envers leurs maris et r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e8rent \u00ab Idiot ! \u00bb je ne sais combien de fois. Alors le Chef Principal de la Tribu de Tegumai cria, dit et chanta : \u2014 \u00d4 Petite-Personne-sans-mani\u00e8res-qui-m\u00e9riterait-une-bonne-fess\u00e9e, tu as d\u00e9couvert une grande invention ! \u2014 Je ne l'ai pas fait expr\u00e8s ; je voulais seulement le harpon \u00e0 manche noir de Papa, dit Taffy. \u2014 Peu importe. C'est tout de m\u00eame une grande invention et un jour les hommes appelleront \u00e7a l'\u00e9criture. Pour l'instant ce ne sont que des dessins et comme nous avons pu le constater aujourd'hui, les dessins ne sont pas toujours bien compris. Mais un jour viendra, \u00f4 enfant de Tegumai, o\u00f9 nous ferons des lettres (vingt-six en tout) et o\u00f9 nous saurons lire et \u00e9crire. Alors nous dirons toujours exactement ce que nous aurons \u00e0 dire, sans aucune erreur. Que les Dames N\u00e9olithiques lavent les cheveux de l'\u00c9tranger ! \u2014 Eh bien, j'en suis ravie, dit Taffy, car apr\u00e8s tout, bien que vous ayez apport\u00e9 tous les harpons de la Tribu de Tegumai, vous avez oubli\u00e9 le harpon \u00e0 manche noir de mon Papa. Alors le Chef Principal cria, dit et chanta : \u2014 Ch\u00e8re Taffy, la prochaine fois que tu \u00e9criras une lettre dessin, confie-la plut\u00f4t \u00e0 un homme qui parle notre langue pour qu'il puisse en expliquer le sens. \u00c7a ne me g\u00eane pas car je suis le Chef Principal, mais c'est tr\u00e8s mauvais pour le reste de la Tribu de Tegumai et comme tu le vois, \u00e7a surprend les \u00e9trangers. Ils accueillirent l'\u00c9tranger (un authentique Tewara de Tewar) au sein de la Tribu de Tegumai car c'\u00e9tait un monsieur et il n'avait pas fait tout un plat de la boue que les Dames N\u00e9olithiques lui avaient mise dans les cheveux. Mais depuis ce jour (et ce doit \u00eatre \u00e0 cause de Taffy) tr\u00e8s peu de petites filles aiment apprendre \u00e0 lire et \u00e0 \u00e9crire. La plupart pr\u00e9f\u00e8rent dessiner ou jouer avec leurs Papas comme Taffy.","title":"Comment naquit la premi\u00e8re lettre"},{"location":"%C3%89criture/Blog%20Centaure/En%20lisant%20en%20%C3%A9crivant/L%27invention%20de%20l%27%C3%A9criture/","text":"L\u2019invention de l\u2019\u00e9criture \u29eb Socrate J\u2019ai donc oui dire qu\u2019il existait pr\u00e8s de Naucratis, en \u00c9gypte, un des antiques dieux de ce pays, et qu\u2019\u00e0 ce dieu les \u00c9gyptiens consacr\u00e8rent l\u2019oiseau qu\u2019ils appelaient ibis.

J\u2019avais \u00e9crit sur ce sujet en son temps, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire au moment o\u00f9 la question semblait pertinente. D\u00e9sormais, chaque fois qu\u2019on me demande de me prononcer, je ne peux rien faire d\u2019autre que r\u00e9crire le m\u00eame texte. Personne ne s\u2019en aper\u00e7oit, avant tout parce qu\u2019il n\u2019y a rien de plus in\u00e9dit que ce qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9j\u00e0 publi\u00e9 ; et ensuite parce que l\u2019opinion publique (ou les journalistes tout au moins) a toujours cette id\u00e9e fixe que le livre va dispara\u00eetre (ou alors ce sont ces journalistes qui pensent que leurs lecteurs ont cette id\u00e9e fixe) et chacun formule inlassablement la m\u00eame interrogation. Il y a en r\u00e9alit\u00e9 tr\u00e8s peu de chose \u00e0 dire sur le sujet. Avec Internet, nous sommes revenus \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e8re alphab\u00e9tique. Si jamais nous avions cru \u00eatre entr\u00e9s dans la civilisation des images, voil\u00e0 que l\u2019ordinateur nous r\u00e9introduit dans la galaxie de Gutenberg et tout le monde se trouve d\u00e9sormais oblig\u00e9 de lire. Pour lire, il faut un support. Ce support ne peut pas \u00eatre le seul ordinateur. Passez deux heures sur votre ordinateur \u00e0 lire un roman et vos yeux deviennent des balles de tennis. J\u2019ai chez moi des lunettes Polaro\u00efd qui me permettent de me prot\u00e9ger les yeux contre les nuisances d\u2019une lecture continue de l\u2019\u00e9cran. D\u2019ailleurs l\u2019ordinateur d\u00e9pend de la pr\u00e9sence de l\u2019\u00e9lectricit\u00e9 et ne peut pas \u00eatre lu dans une baignoire, m\u00eame pas couch\u00e9 sur le c\u00f4t\u00e9 dans un lit. Le livre se pr\u00e9sente donc comme un outil plus flexible. De deux choses l\u2019une : ou bien le livre demeurera le support de la lecture, ou bien il existera quelque chose qui ressemblera \u00e0 ce que le livre n\u2019a jamais cess\u00e9 d\u2019\u00eatre, m\u00eame avant l\u2019invention de l\u2019imprimerie. Les variations autour de l\u2019objet livre n\u2019en ont pas modifi\u00e9 la fonction, ni la syntaxe, depuis plus de cinq cents ans. Le livre est comme la cuiller, le marteau, la roue ou le ciseau. Une fois que vous les avez invent\u00e9s, vous ne pouvez pas faire mieux. Vous ne pouvez pas faire une cuill\u00e8re qui soit mieux qu\u2019une cuill\u00e8re. Des designers tentent d\u2019am\u00e9liorer par exemple le tire-bouchon, avec des succ\u00e8s tr\u00e8s mitig\u00e9s, et la plupart d\u2019ailleurs ne fonctionnent pas. Philippe Starck a essay\u00e9 d\u2019innover du c\u00f4t\u00e9 des presse-citrons, mais le sien (pour sauvegarder une certaine puret\u00e9 esth\u00e9tique) laisse passer les p\u00e9pins. Le livre a fait ses preuves et on ne voit pas comment, pour le m\u00eame usage, nous pourrions faire mieux que le livre. Peut-\u00eatre \u00e9voluera-t-il dans ses composantes, peut-\u00eatre ses pages ne seront-elles plus en papier. Mais il demeurera ce qu\u2019il est. J.-C.C. : Il semble que les derni\u00e8res versions de l\u2019e-book le placent d\u00e9sormais en concurrence directe avec le livre imprim\u00e9. Le mod\u00e8le \u00ab Reader \u00bb contient d\u00e9j\u00e0 160 titres. U.E. : Il est \u00e9vident qu\u2019un magistrat emportera plus facilement chez lui les 25 000 pi\u00e8ces d\u2019un proc\u00e8s en cours si elles sont m\u00e9moris\u00e9es dans un e-book. Dans de nombreux domaines, le livre \u00e9lectronique apportera un confort d\u2019utilisation extraordinaire. Je continue simplement \u00e0 me demander si, m\u00eame avec la technologie la mieux adapt\u00e9e aux exigences de la lecture, il sera tr\u00e8s opportun de lire Guerre et Paix sur un e-book. Nous verrons bien. De toute fa\u00e7on nous ne pourrons plus lire les Tolsto\u00ef et tous les livres imprim\u00e9s sur de la p\u00e2te \u00e0 papier, tout simplement parce qu\u2019ils ont d\u00e9j\u00e0 commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 se d\u00e9composer dans nos biblioth\u00e8ques. Les Gallimard et les Vrin des ann\u00e9es cinquante ont d\u00e9j\u00e0 pour la plupart disparu. La Philosophie au Moyen Age de Gilson, qui m\u2019avait tant servi \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque o\u00f9 je pr\u00e9parais ma th\u00e8se, je ne peux m\u00eame pas le prendre en main aujourd\u2019hui. Les pages se brisent, litt\u00e9ralement. Je pourrais en acheter une nouvelle \u00e9dition, sans doute, mais c\u2019est \u00e0 la vieille que je suis attach\u00e9, avec toutes mes annotations de couleurs diff\u00e9rentes qui font l\u2019histoire de mes diff\u00e9rentes consultations. Jean-Philippe de Tonnac : Avec la mise au point de nouveaux supports de mieux en mieux adapt\u00e9s aux exigences et au confort d\u2019une lecture tout terrain, qu\u2019elle soit celle des encyclop\u00e9dies ou des romans en ligne, pourquoi ne pas imaginer malgr\u00e9 tout une lente d\u00e9saffection pour l\u2019objet livre sous sa forme traditionnelle ? U.E. : Tout peut advenir. Les livres peuvent n\u2019int\u00e9resser demain qu\u2019une poign\u00e9e d\u2019inconditionnels qui iront satisfaire leur curiosit\u00e9 pass\u00e9iste dans des mus\u00e9es, dans des biblioth\u00e8ques. J.-C.C. : S\u2019il en reste. U.E. : Mais nous pouvons tout aussi bien imaginer que la formidable invention qu\u2019est Internet disparaisse \u00e0 son tour, dans le futur. Exactement comme les dirigeables ont disparu de nos ciels. Lorsque le Hindenburg prend feu \u00e0 New York, un peu avant la guerre, l\u2019avenir des dirigeables est mort. M\u00eame chose pour le Concorde : l\u2019accident de Gonesse en 2000 lui a \u00e9t\u00e9 fatal. L\u2019histoire est tout de m\u00eame extraordinaire. On invente un avion qui, au lieu de mettre huit heures pour traverser l\u2019Atlantique, n\u2019en demande que trois. Qui aurait pu contester un tel progr\u00e8s ? Mais on y renonce, apr\u00e8s cette catastrophe de Gonesse, en estimant que le Concorde co\u00fbte trop cher. Est-ce une raison s\u00e9rieuse ? La bombe atomique aussi co\u00fbte tr\u00e8s cher ! J.-P. de T. : Je vous cite cette remarque de Hermann Hesse \u00e0 propos d\u2019une probable \u00ab rel\u00e9gitimation \u00bb du livre que devaient permettre, selon lui, les progr\u00e8s techniques. Il doit s\u2019exprimer dans les ann\u00e9es cinquante : \u00ab Plus, avec le temps, les besoins de distraction et d\u2019\u00e9ducation populaire pourront \u00eatre satisfaits par des inventions nouvelles, et plus le livre regagnera de sa dignit\u00e9 et de son autorit\u00e9. Nous n\u2019avons pas encore tout \u00e0 fait atteint le point o\u00f9 les jeunes inventions concurrentes comme la radio, le cin\u00e9ma, etc., \u00f4tent au livre imprim\u00e9 cette part de ses fonctions qu\u2019il peut justement perdre sans dommage. \u00bb J.-C.C. : En ce sens il ne s\u2019est pas tromp\u00e9. Le cin\u00e9ma et la radio, la t\u00e9l\u00e9vision m\u00eame n\u2019ont rien enlev\u00e9 au livre, rien qu\u2019il n\u2019ait perdu \u00ab sans dommage \u00bb. U.E. : A un certain moment, les hommes inventent l\u2019\u00e9criture. Nous pouvons consid\u00e9rer que l\u2019\u00e9criture est le prolongement de la main et dans ce sens elle est presque biologique. Elle est la technologie de communication imm\u00e9diatement li\u00e9e au corps. Lorsque vous avez invent\u00e9 \u00e7a, vous ne pouvez plus y renoncer.

J\u2019avais \u00e9crit sur ce sujet en son temps, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire au moment o\u00f9 la question semblait pertinente. D\u00e9sormais, chaque fois qu\u2019on me demande de me prononcer, je ne peux rien faire d\u2019autre que r\u00e9crire le m\u00eame texte. Personne ne s\u2019en aper\u00e7oit, avant tout parce qu\u2019il n\u2019y a rien de plus in\u00e9dit que ce qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9j\u00e0 publi\u00e9 ; et ensuite parce que l\u2019opinion publique (ou les journalistes tout au moins) a toujours cette id\u00e9e fixe que le livre va dispara\u00eetre (ou alors ce sont ces journalistes qui pensent que leurs lecteurs ont cette id\u00e9e fixe) et chacun formule inlassablement la m\u00eame interrogation. Il y a en r\u00e9alit\u00e9 tr\u00e8s peu de chose \u00e0 dire sur le sujet. Avec Internet, nous sommes revenus \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e8re alphab\u00e9tique. Si jamais nous avions cru \u00eatre entr\u00e9s dans la civilisation des images, voil\u00e0 que l\u2019ordinateur nous r\u00e9introduit dans la galaxie de Gutenberg et tout le monde se trouve d\u00e9sormais oblig\u00e9 de lire. Pour lire, il faut un support. Ce support ne peut pas \u00eatre le seul ordinateur. Passez deux heures sur votre ordinateur \u00e0 lire un roman et vos yeux deviennent des balles de tennis. J\u2019ai chez moi des lunettes Polaro\u00efd qui me permettent de me prot\u00e9ger les yeux contre les nuisances d\u2019une lecture continue de l\u2019\u00e9cran. D\u2019ailleurs l\u2019ordinateur d\u00e9pend de la pr\u00e9sence de l\u2019\u00e9lectricit\u00e9 et ne peut pas \u00eatre lu dans une baignoire, m\u00eame pas couch\u00e9 sur le c\u00f4t\u00e9 dans un lit. Le livre se pr\u00e9sente donc comme un outil plus flexible. De deux choses l\u2019une : ou bien le livre demeurera le support de la lecture, ou bien il existera quelque chose qui ressemblera \u00e0 ce que le livre n\u2019a jamais cess\u00e9 d\u2019\u00eatre, m\u00eame avant l\u2019invention de l\u2019imprimerie. Les variations autour de l\u2019objet livre n\u2019en ont pas modifi\u00e9 la fonction, ni la syntaxe, depuis plus de cinq cents ans. Le livre est comme la cuiller, le marteau, la roue ou le ciseau. Une fois que vous les avez invent\u00e9s, vous ne pouvez pas faire mieux. Vous ne pouvez pas faire une cuill\u00e8re qui soit mieux qu\u2019une cuill\u00e8re. Des designers tentent d\u2019am\u00e9liorer par exemple le tire-bouchon, avec des succ\u00e8s tr\u00e8s mitig\u00e9s, et la plupart d\u2019ailleurs ne fonctionnent pas. Philippe Starck a essay\u00e9 d\u2019innover du c\u00f4t\u00e9 des presse-citrons, mais le sien (pour sauvegarder une certaine puret\u00e9 esth\u00e9tique) laisse passer les p\u00e9pins. Le livre a fait ses preuves et on ne voit pas comment, pour le m\u00eame usage, nous pourrions faire mieux que le livre. Peut-\u00eatre \u00e9voluera-t-il dans ses composantes, peut-\u00eatre ses pages ne seront-elles plus en papier. Mais il demeurera ce qu\u2019il est. J.-C.C. : Il semble que les derni\u00e8res versions de l\u2019e-book le placent d\u00e9sormais en concurrence directe avec le livre imprim\u00e9. Le mod\u00e8le \u00ab Reader \u00bb contient d\u00e9j\u00e0 160 titres. U.E. : Il est \u00e9vident qu\u2019un magistrat emportera plus facilement chez lui les 25 000 pi\u00e8ces d\u2019un proc\u00e8s en cours si elles sont m\u00e9moris\u00e9es dans un e-book. Dans de nombreux domaines, le livre \u00e9lectronique apportera un confort d\u2019utilisation extraordinaire. Je continue simplement \u00e0 me demander si, m\u00eame avec la technologie la mieux adapt\u00e9e aux exigences de la lecture, il sera tr\u00e8s opportun de lire Guerre et Paix sur un e-book. Nous verrons bien. De toute fa\u00e7on nous ne pourrons plus lire les Tolsto\u00ef et tous les livres imprim\u00e9s sur de la p\u00e2te \u00e0 papier, tout simplement parce qu\u2019ils ont d\u00e9j\u00e0 commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 se d\u00e9composer dans nos biblioth\u00e8ques. Les Gallimard et les Vrin des ann\u00e9es cinquante ont d\u00e9j\u00e0 pour la plupart disparu. La Philosophie au Moyen Age de Gilson, qui m\u2019avait tant servi \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque o\u00f9 je pr\u00e9parais ma th\u00e8se, je ne peux m\u00eame pas le prendre en main aujourd\u2019hui. Les pages se brisent, litt\u00e9ralement. Je pourrais en acheter une nouvelle \u00e9dition, sans doute, mais c\u2019est \u00e0 la vieille que je suis attach\u00e9, avec toutes mes annotations de couleurs diff\u00e9rentes qui font l\u2019histoire de mes diff\u00e9rentes consultations. Jean-Philippe de Tonnac : Avec la mise au point de nouveaux supports de mieux en mieux adapt\u00e9s aux exigences et au confort d\u2019une lecture tout terrain, qu\u2019elle soit celle des encyclop\u00e9dies ou des romans en ligne, pourquoi ne pas imaginer malgr\u00e9 tout une lente d\u00e9saffection pour l\u2019objet livre sous sa forme traditionnelle ? U.E. : Tout peut advenir. Les livres peuvent n\u2019int\u00e9resser demain qu\u2019une poign\u00e9e d\u2019inconditionnels qui iront satisfaire leur curiosit\u00e9 pass\u00e9iste dans des mus\u00e9es, dans des biblioth\u00e8ques. J.-C.C. : S\u2019il en reste. U.E. : Mais nous pouvons tout aussi bien imaginer que la formidable invention qu\u2019est Internet disparaisse \u00e0 son tour, dans le futur. Exactement comme les dirigeables ont disparu de nos ciels. Lorsque le Hindenburg prend feu \u00e0 New York, un peu avant la guerre, l\u2019avenir des dirigeables est mort. M\u00eame chose pour le Concorde : l\u2019accident de Gonesse en 2000 lui a \u00e9t\u00e9 fatal. L\u2019histoire est tout de m\u00eame extraordinaire. On invente un avion qui, au lieu de mettre huit heures pour traverser l\u2019Atlantique, n\u2019en demande que trois. Qui aurait pu contester un tel progr\u00e8s ? Mais on y renonce, apr\u00e8s cette catastrophe de Gonesse, en estimant que le Concorde co\u00fbte trop cher. Est-ce une raison s\u00e9rieuse ? La bombe atomique aussi co\u00fbte tr\u00e8s cher ! J.-P. de T. : Je vous cite cette remarque de Hermann Hesse \u00e0 propos d\u2019une probable \u00ab rel\u00e9gitimation \u00bb du livre que devaient permettre, selon lui, les progr\u00e8s techniques. Il doit s\u2019exprimer dans les ann\u00e9es cinquante : \u00ab Plus, avec le temps, les besoins de distraction et d\u2019\u00e9ducation populaire pourront \u00eatre satisfaits par des inventions nouvelles, et plus le livre regagnera de sa dignit\u00e9 et de son autorit\u00e9. Nous n\u2019avons pas encore tout \u00e0 fait atteint le point o\u00f9 les jeunes inventions concurrentes comme la radio, le cin\u00e9ma, etc., \u00f4tent au livre imprim\u00e9 cette part de ses fonctions qu\u2019il peut justement perdre sans dommage. \u00bb J.-C.C. : En ce sens il ne s\u2019est pas tromp\u00e9. Le cin\u00e9ma et la radio, la t\u00e9l\u00e9vision m\u00eame n\u2019ont rien enlev\u00e9 au livre, rien qu\u2019il n\u2019ait perdu \u00ab sans dommage \u00bb. U.E. : A un certain moment, les hommes inventent l\u2019\u00e9criture. Nous pouvons consid\u00e9rer que l\u2019\u00e9criture est le prolongement de la main et dans ce sens elle est presque biologique. Elle est la technologie de communication imm\u00e9diatement li\u00e9e au corps. Lorsque vous avez invent\u00e9 \u00e7a, vous ne pouvez plus y renoncer. Encore une fois, c\u2019est comme avoir invent\u00e9 la roue. Nos roues d\u2019aujourd\u2019hui sont celles de la pr\u00e9histoire. Tandis que nos inventions modernes, cin\u00e9ma, radio, Internet, ne sont pas biologiques.

Avant de comprendre l\u2019histoire de l\u2019alphabet, la signification des lettres et tous les symboles qui sont cach\u00e9s derri\u00e8re, il est important de se mettre d\u2019accord pour d\u00e9finir le mot \u00ab alphabet \u00bb. Tu le trouveras dans le dictionnaire : comme une tr\u00e8s grande partie des mots du fran\u00e7ais, il vient d\u2019un mot latin, alphabetum . Le latin \u00e9tait la langue parl\u00e9e par les Romains. \u2013 Et que signifie ce mot ? \u2013 Le sens que nous lui donnons : C\u2019est l\u2019ensemble d\u2019une s\u00e9rie de lettres qui permettent d\u2019\u00e9crire et de lire ! Les Romains l\u2019ont eux-m\u00eames emprunt\u00e9 aux Grecs, qui utilisaient entre autres le mot alphabetos . \u2013 Et pourquoi alphabetos ? \u2013 Parce que les deux premi\u00e8res lettres de la s\u00e9rie en grec sont alpha et b\u00eata , ce qui a donn\u00e9 alphabetos , puis alphabetum en latin. Alpha et b\u00eata n\u2019ont aucune signification : ces noms d\u00e9signent simplement les lettres a et b . Les Grecs ont eux-m\u00eames h\u00e9rit\u00e9 ce syst\u00e8me \u2013 avec l\u2019ordre des lettres, leurs noms et leurs formes \u2013 d\u2019une civilisation qui vivait sur l\u2019autre rive de la M\u00e9diterran\u00e9e. \u2013 Comment s\u2019appelait cette civilisation ? \u2013 On l\u2019appelle \u00ab ph\u00e9nicienne \u00bb. Mais, dans sa propre langue, cette civilisation, qui regroupait plusieurs peuples diff\u00e9rents, utilisait le terme \u00ab canan\u00e9enne \u00bb. En effet, le pays de ces peuples s\u2019appelait \u00ab Canaan \u00bb, un mot qui signifiait dans leur langue \u00ab marchand \u00bb, et aussi la couleur \u00ab rouge pourpre \u00bb. Les arch\u00e9ologues expliquent que sur la terre de Canaan se pratiquait l\u2019industrie de cette couleur, d\u2019o\u00f9 son nom. En effet, avec le temps, les noms du pays et de la couleur se recouvrirent dans l\u2019id\u00e9e que s\u2019en faisaient les peuples alentour. D\u2019o\u00f9 aussi le mot \u00ab ph\u00e9nicienne \u00bb employ\u00e9 par les Grecs pour cette civilisation : en effet, le mot phoenix en grec veut dire \u00ab pourpre \u00bb ! Hom\u00e8re en parle dans l\u2019 Iliade . On trouve aussi le mot \u00ab sidonien \u00bb, pour d\u00e9signer les gens ou les choses qui viennent de Sidon, ou encore \u00ab tyrien \u00bb, de Tyr, deux villes importantes de cette civilisation canan\u00e9enne ou ph\u00e9nicienne. Si tu regardes une carte du Liban, tu verras qu\u2019au sud de Beyrouth, sur la c\u00f4te m\u00e9diterran\u00e9enne, Tyr existe toujours. \u2013 Mais o\u00f9 se trouve exactement cette r\u00e9gion de Canaan ? \u2013 C\u2019est grossi\u00e8rement la r\u00e9gion du Proche-Orient situ\u00e9e le plus \u00e0 l\u2019ouest, celle qui se trouve pr\u00e8s de la M\u00e9diterran\u00e9e. Au moment o\u00f9 les Grecs emploient le mot \u00ab ph\u00e9nicien \u00bb, il ne concerne d\u00e9j\u00e0 plus l\u2019ensemble des habitants de cette r\u00e9gion, mais seulement la population du nord de ce pays du Levant, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire la c\u00f4te libanaise actuelle et la partie syrienne ouverte sur la M\u00e9diterran\u00e9e. \u2013 Ce sont donc ces Ph\u00e9niciens qui ont invent\u00e9 l\u2019alphabet et qui l\u2019ont ensuite transmis aux Grecs ? \u2013 Je vais peut-\u00eatre encore te surprendre, mais, contrairement \u00e0 ce que tu entendras ou liras souvent, ce ne sont pas les Ph\u00e9niciens qui ont invent\u00e9 l\u2019alphabet. Mais ils ont jou\u00e9 un r\u00f4le essentiel et central dans cette histoire, car ce sont eux qui en furent les diffuseurs et les transmetteurs, en particulier aux Grecs, mais aussi \u00e0 de nombreux peuples de tout le pourtour m\u00e9diterran\u00e9en. \u2013 Pourquoi ? \u2013 Les Ph\u00e9niciens \u00e9taient des commer\u00e7ants et ils install\u00e8rent dans tous les ports autour de la M\u00e9diterran\u00e9e des \u00ab comptoirs \u00bb, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire des sortes de magasins pour faire des affaires, vendre leurs produits et acheter ceux des autres, et aussi nouer des liens de toutes sortes. Leurs marins sillonnaient toute la M\u00e9diterran\u00e9e. Ils cr\u00e9\u00e8rent entre autres la ville de Carthage dans l\u2019actuelle Tunisie. Un nom venu du canan\u00e9en, Qart-hadach , signifiait la \u00ab ville nouvelle \u00bb. Naquit ainsi la civilisation carthaginoise ou \u00ab punique \u00bb, h\u00e9riti\u00e8re directe de la Ph\u00e9nicie et des Ph\u00e9niciens. Le mot \u00ab punique \u00bb vient lui-m\u00eame du mot grec phoinik\u00e9 , \u00ab Ph\u00e9nicie \u00bb. Au VIIIe si\u00e8cle avant notre \u00e8re, pour les \u00e9changes commerciaux, les Grecs emprunt\u00e8rent cet alphabet aux Ph\u00e9niciens ; il s\u2019est ensuite transmis aux \u00c9trusques, le peuple qui \u00e9tait pr\u00e9sent en Italie avant les Latins. Plus tard, avec l\u2019expansion de l\u2019Empire romain, puis du christianisme, dans la plupart des pays de ce qui s\u2019appellera l\u2019Europe, l\u2019alphabet ph\u00e9nicien est devenu l\u2019alphabet d\u2019abord de tout l\u2019Occident, puis d\u2019une grande partie de monde.","title":"Les inventeurs"},{"location":"%C3%89criture/Blog%20Centaure/En%20lisant%20en%20%C3%A9crivant/Les%20inventeurs/#1","text":"","title":"1"},{"location":"%C3%89criture/Blog%20Centaure/En%20lisant%20en%20%C3%A9crivant/Les%20inventeurs/#les-inventeurs","text":"\u2013 L\u2019alphabet est constitu\u00e9 des lettres que nous utilisons pour \u00e9crire et lire, mais d\u2019o\u00f9 viennent-elles ?

Les arch\u00e9ologues expliquent que sur la terre de Canaan se pratiquait l\u2019industrie de cette couleur, d\u2019o\u00f9 son nom. En effet, avec le temps, les noms du pays et de la couleur se recouvrirent dans l\u2019id\u00e9e que s\u2019en faisaient les peuples alentour. D\u2019o\u00f9 aussi le mot \u00ab ph\u00e9nicienne \u00bb employ\u00e9 par les Grecs pour cette civilisation : en effet, le mot phoenix en grec veut dire \u00ab pourpre \u00bb ! Hom\u00e8re en parle dans l\u2019 Iliade . On trouve aussi le mot \u00ab sidonien \u00bb, pour d\u00e9signer les gens ou les choses qui viennent de Sidon, ou encore \u00ab tyrien \u00bb, de Tyr, deux villes importantes de cette civilisation canan\u00e9enne ou ph\u00e9nicienne. Si tu regardes une carte du Liban, tu verras qu\u2019au sud de Beyrouth, sur la c\u00f4te m\u00e9diterran\u00e9enne, Tyr existe toujours. \u2013 Mais o\u00f9 se trouve exactement cette r\u00e9gion de Canaan ? \u2013 C\u2019est grossi\u00e8rement la r\u00e9gion du Proche-Orient situ\u00e9e le plus \u00e0 l\u2019ouest, celle qui se trouve pr\u00e8s de la M\u00e9diterran\u00e9e. Au moment o\u00f9 les Grecs emploient le mot \u00ab ph\u00e9nicien \u00bb, il ne concerne d\u00e9j\u00e0 plus l\u2019ensemble des habitants de cette r\u00e9gion, mais seulement la population du nord de ce pays du Levant, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire la c\u00f4te libanaise actuelle et la partie syrienne ouverte sur la M\u00e9diterran\u00e9e. \u2013 Ce sont donc ces Ph\u00e9niciens qui ont invent\u00e9 l\u2019alphabet et qui l\u2019ont ensuite transmis aux Grecs ? \u2013 Je vais peut-\u00eatre encore te surprendre, mais, contrairement \u00e0 ce que tu entendras ou liras souvent, ce ne sont pas les Ph\u00e9niciens qui ont invent\u00e9 l\u2019alphabet. Mais ils ont jou\u00e9 un r\u00f4le essentiel et central dans cette histoire, car ce sont eux qui en furent les diffuseurs et les transmetteurs, en particulier aux Grecs, mais aussi \u00e0 de nombreux peuples de tout le pourtour m\u00e9diterran\u00e9en. \u2013 Pourquoi ? \u2013 Les Ph\u00e9niciens \u00e9taient des commer\u00e7ants et ils install\u00e8rent dans tous les ports autour de la M\u00e9diterran\u00e9e des \u00ab comptoirs \u00bb, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire des sortes de magasins pour faire des affaires, vendre leurs produits et acheter ceux des autres, et aussi nouer des liens de toutes sortes. Leurs marins sillonnaient toute la M\u00e9diterran\u00e9e. Ils cr\u00e9\u00e8rent entre autres la ville de Carthage dans l\u2019actuelle Tunisie. Un nom venu du canan\u00e9en, Qart-hadach , signifiait la \u00ab ville nouvelle \u00bb. Naquit ainsi la civilisation carthaginoise ou \u00ab punique \u00bb, h\u00e9riti\u00e8re directe de la Ph\u00e9nicie et des Ph\u00e9niciens. Le mot \u00ab punique \u00bb vient lui-m\u00eame du mot grec phoinik\u00e9 , \u00ab Ph\u00e9nicie \u00bb. Au VIIIe si\u00e8cle avant notre \u00e8re, pour les \u00e9changes commerciaux, les Grecs emprunt\u00e8rent cet alphabet aux Ph\u00e9niciens ; il s\u2019est ensuite transmis aux \u00c9trusques, le peuple qui \u00e9tait pr\u00e9sent en Italie avant les Latins. Plus tard, avec l\u2019expansion de l\u2019Empire romain, puis du christianisme, dans la plupart des pays de ce qui s\u2019appellera l\u2019Europe, l\u2019alphabet ph\u00e9nicien est devenu l\u2019alphabet d\u2019abord de tout l\u2019Occident, puis d\u2019une grande partie de monde.","title":"Les inventeurs"},{"location":"%C3%89criture/Blog%20Centaure/En%20lisant%20en%20%C3%A9crivant/Plan/","text":"Plan \u29eb S\u00e9ance 1 Questionnement \u29eb Le livre, un objet technique Pourquoi lit-on ?

Malheureusement, le cerveau humain n\u2019est pas un bon moyen de stockage pour les bases de donn\u00e9es de la taille d\u2019un empire. Il y a \u00e0 cela trois raisons. Premi\u00e8rement, le cerveau est d\u2019une capacit\u00e9 limit\u00e9e. Certes, d\u2019aucuns sont dou\u00e9s de m\u00e9moires stup\u00e9fiantes et, dans les temps anciens, il y avait des professionnels de la m\u00e9moire qui pouvaient emmagasiner la topographie de provinces enti\u00e8res et les codes de lois de plusieurs \u00c9tats. Il est n\u00e9anmoins une limite que les mn\u00e9monistes les plus dou\u00e9s ne sauraient d\u00e9passer. Un juriste pourrait savoir par c\u0153ur tout le code de lois du Commonwealth du Massachusetts, mais pas les d\u00e9tails de toutes les proc\u00e9dures engag\u00e9es dans cet \u00c9tat depuis le proc\u00e8s des sorci\u00e8res de Salem. Deuxi\u00e8mement, les hommes meurent, et leur cerveau meurt avec eux. Toute l\u2019information stock\u00e9e dans un cerveau sera effac\u00e9e dans moins d\u2019un si\u00e8cle. Il est bien entendu possible de transmettre des souvenirs d\u2019un cerveau \u00e0 l\u2019autre, mais \u00e0 la suite de quelques transmissions, l\u2019information a tendance \u00e0 s\u2019embrouiller ou \u00e0 se perdre. Troisi\u00e8mement, et c\u2019est le plus important, le cerveau humain a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait pour stocker et traiter uniquement des types d\u2019information bien particuliers. Pour survivre, les chasseurs-cueilleurs anciens devaient se souvenir des formes, des qualit\u00e9s et des comportements de milliers d\u2019esp\u00e8ces v\u00e9g\u00e9tales et animales. Ils devaient se souvenir qu\u2019un champignon jaune frip\u00e9 poussant l\u2019automne sous un orme est tr\u00e8s probablement v\u00e9n\u00e9neux, mais qu\u2019un champignon semblable qui pousse l\u2019hiver sous un ch\u00eane est un bon rem\u00e8de quand on a mal au ventre. Les chasseurs-cueilleurs devaient aussi garder pr\u00e9sentes \u00e0 l\u2019esprit les opinions et les relations de plusieurs douzaines de membres de leur bande. Si Lucy avait besoin de l\u2019aide d\u2019un membre pour convaincre John de cesser de la harceler, autant se souvenir que John avait rompu la semaine pass\u00e9e avec Mary, qui pouvait donc \u00eatre une alli\u00e9e enthousiaste. Les pressions de l\u2019\u00e9volution ont ainsi adapt\u00e9 le cerveau humain au stockage d\u2019immenses quantit\u00e9s d\u2019informations botaniques, zoologiques, topographiques et sociales. Mais quand, \u00e0 la veille de la R\u00e9volution agricole, commenc\u00e8rent \u00e0 appara\u00eetre des soci\u00e9t\u00e9s particuli\u00e8rement complexes, un nouveau type d\u2019information enti\u00e8rement nouveau devint vital : les chiffres. Les fourrageurs ne furent jamais oblig\u00e9s de manipuler de grosses quantit\u00e9s de donn\u00e9es math\u00e9matiques. Un fourrageur n\u2019avait aucun besoin de se rappeler le nombre de fruits sur chaque arbre de la for\u00eat. Le cerveau humain ne s\u2019adapta donc pas au stockage et au traitement des chiffres. Pour garder un grand royaume, en revanche, les donn\u00e9es math\u00e9matiques \u00e9taient capitales. Jamais il ne fut suffisant de l\u00e9gif\u00e9rer et de raconter des histoires sur les dieux tut\u00e9laires. Il fallait aussi collecter des imp\u00f4ts. Pour taxer des centaines de milliers de gens, il \u00e9tait imp\u00e9ratif de recueillir des donn\u00e9es sur leurs revenus et possessions, sur les paiements effectu\u00e9s, sur les arri\u00e9r\u00e9s, les dettes et les amendes, les remises et les exon\u00e9rations. Tout cela faisait des millions d\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ments \u00e0 stocker et \u00e0 traiter. Sans cette capacit\u00e9, l\u2019\u00c9tat n\u2019aurait jamais su de combien de ressources il disposait ni quelles ressources suppl\u00e9mentaires il pouvait exploiter. Face \u00e0 la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 de m\u00e9moriser, de se rappeler et de manipuler tous ces chiffres, la plupart des cerveaux humains faisaient une overdose ou s\u2019endormaient. Cette limite mentale faisait peser une contrainte s\u00e9v\u00e8re sur la taille et la complexit\u00e9 des collectivit\u00e9s humaines. Quand le nombre d\u2019hommes et la masse des biens d\u00e9passaient un seuil critique dans une soci\u00e9t\u00e9 particuli\u00e8re, il devenait n\u00e9cessaire de stocker et de traiter de grosses quantit\u00e9s de donn\u00e9es math\u00e9matiques. Le cerveau humain en \u00e9tant bien incapable, le syst\u00e8me s\u2019effondrait. Des mill\u00e9naires durant, apr\u00e8s la R\u00e9volution agricole, les r\u00e9seaux sociaux rest\u00e8rent relativement petits et simples. Les premiers \u00e0 surmonter le probl\u00e8me furent les Sum\u00e9riens, dans le sud de la M\u00e9sopotamie. Le soleil de plomb qui s\u2019abattait sur les riches plaines limoneuses assurait des r\u00e9coltes abondantes et des cit\u00e9s prosp\u00e8res. Avec la croissance d\u00e9mographique s\u2019accrut aussi la quantit\u00e9 d\u2019informations n\u00e9cessaires pour coordonner leurs affaires. Entre 3500 et 3000 avant notre \u00e8re, pour stocker et traiter des informations hors de leur cerveau, des g\u00e9nies sum\u00e9riens inconnus invent\u00e8rent un syst\u00e8me \u00e9labor\u00e9 permettant de traiter de grosses quantit\u00e9s de donn\u00e9es math\u00e9matiques. Ce faisant, les Sum\u00e9riens parvinrent \u00e0 soustraire leur ordre social aux limites du cerveau humain, ouvrant la voie \u00e0 l\u2019apparition des villes, des royaumes et des empires. Le syst\u00e8me de traitement des donn\u00e9es invent\u00e9 par les Sum\u00e9riens est ce qu\u2019on appelle \u00ab l\u2019\u00e9criture \u00bb.

Mais quand, \u00e0 la veille de la R\u00e9volution agricole, commenc\u00e8rent \u00e0 appara\u00eetre des soci\u00e9t\u00e9s particuli\u00e8rement complexes, un nouveau type d\u2019information enti\u00e8rement nouveau devint vital : les chiffres. Les fourrageurs ne furent jamais oblig\u00e9s de manipuler de grosses quantit\u00e9s de donn\u00e9es math\u00e9matiques. Un fourrageur n\u2019avait aucun besoin de se rappeler le nombre de fruits sur chaque arbre de la for\u00eat. Le cerveau humain ne s\u2019adapta donc pas au stockage et au traitement des chiffres. Pour garder un grand royaume, en revanche, les donn\u00e9es math\u00e9matiques \u00e9taient capitales. Jamais il ne fut suffisant de l\u00e9gif\u00e9rer et de raconter des histoires sur les dieux tut\u00e9laires. Il fallait aussi collecter des imp\u00f4ts. Pour taxer des centaines de milliers de gens, il \u00e9tait imp\u00e9ratif de recueillir des donn\u00e9es sur leurs revenus et possessions, sur les paiements effectu\u00e9s, sur les arri\u00e9r\u00e9s, les dettes et les amendes, les remises et les exon\u00e9rations. Tout cela faisait des millions d\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ments \u00e0 stocker et \u00e0 traiter. Sans cette capacit\u00e9, l\u2019\u00c9tat n\u2019aurait jamais su de combien de ressources il disposait ni quelles ressources suppl\u00e9mentaires il pouvait exploiter. Face \u00e0 la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 de m\u00e9moriser, de se rappeler et de manipuler tous ces chiffres, la plupart des cerveaux humains faisaient une overdose ou s\u2019endormaient. Cette limite mentale faisait peser une contrainte s\u00e9v\u00e8re sur la taille et la complexit\u00e9 des collectivit\u00e9s humaines. Quand le nombre d\u2019hommes et la masse des biens d\u00e9passaient un seuil critique dans une soci\u00e9t\u00e9 particuli\u00e8re, il devenait n\u00e9cessaire de stocker et de traiter de grosses quantit\u00e9s de donn\u00e9es math\u00e9matiques. Le cerveau humain en \u00e9tant bien incapable, le syst\u00e8me s\u2019effondrait. Des mill\u00e9naires durant, apr\u00e8s la R\u00e9volution agricole, les r\u00e9seaux sociaux rest\u00e8rent relativement petits et simples. Les premiers \u00e0 surmonter le probl\u00e8me furent les Sum\u00e9riens, dans le sud de la M\u00e9sopotamie. Le soleil de plomb qui s\u2019abattait sur les riches plaines limoneuses assurait des r\u00e9coltes abondantes et des cit\u00e9s prosp\u00e8res. Avec la croissance d\u00e9mographique s\u2019accrut aussi la quantit\u00e9 d\u2019informations n\u00e9cessaires pour coordonner leurs affaires. Entre 3500 et 3000 avant notre \u00e8re, pour stocker et traiter des informations hors de leur cerveau, des g\u00e9nies sum\u00e9riens inconnus invent\u00e8rent un syst\u00e8me \u00e9labor\u00e9 permettant de traiter de grosses quantit\u00e9s de donn\u00e9es math\u00e9matiques. Ce faisant, les Sum\u00e9riens parvinrent \u00e0 soustraire leur ordre social aux limites du cerveau humain, ouvrant la voie \u00e0 l\u2019apparition des villes, des royaumes et des empires. Le syst\u00e8me de traitement des donn\u00e9es invent\u00e9 par les Sum\u00e9riens est ce qu\u2019on appelle \u00ab l\u2019\u00e9criture \u00bb. Sapiens : Une br\u00e8ve histoire de l'humanit\u00e9 (II.

Le pire est que l\u2019incongruit\u00e9 d\u2019une telle proposition ne choque pas plus de gens que \u00e7a (ou pas assez pour que plus jamais personne ne dise un truc pareil), et qu\u2019il ne vient pas \u00e0 l\u2019esprit de ceux qui l\u2019affirment qu\u2019on ne saurait coder sans savoir un minimum d\u2019orthographe qui plus est dans une langue qui n\u2019est pas la n\u00f4tre ni sans un minimum de bagage informatique. Mais il y a pire. On voit bien que ce souci de d\u00e9terminer ce qui doit \u00eatre transmis \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9cole ne s\u2019accompagne d\u2019aucune r\u00e9flexion sur les valeurs \u00e0 transmettre, d\u2019aucune signification autre qu\u2019\u00e9conomique. Je crois comprendre qu\u2019on veut des g\u00e9n\u00e9rations de codeurs parce qu\u2019on trouve _sexy_l\u2019image du hackeur ou du d\u00e9veloppeur et que si en plus celui-ci a un c\u00f4t\u00e9 californien fortun\u00e9, \u00e7a n\u2019en est que meilleur pour la France et nos \u00e9gos. Mais c\u2019est pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment de cette image et surtout de cette \u00e9cole dont je ne veux pas. Comprenez-moi bien : j\u2019appelle le num\u00e9rique de toute mon \u00e2me, mais je refuse de c\u00e9der \u00e0 une vulgate compl\u00e8tement irr\u00e9aliste. J\u2019ai beau le crier sur tous les toits, \u00e7a ne sert \u00e0 rien (il faut dire que mon audience n\u2019est pas bien large). Mais surtout il m\u2019appara\u00eet qu\u2019il faut absolument que je d\u00e9finisse ce qu\u2019est pour moi le num\u00e9rique \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9cole. J\u2019avais d\u00e9j\u00e0 fait un modeste galop d\u2019essai . Je reprends ici avec dix propositions qui fondent ma conception de l\u2019\u00e9cole num\u00e9rique. L\u2019\u00e9l\u00e8ve est un \u00e9crivain \u29eb Le num\u00e9rique, c\u2019est le retour \u00e0 la case Gutenberg. Nos enfants se doivent donc d\u2019\u00e9crire et d\u2019\u00e9crire beaucoup dans des situations tr\u00e8s diverses : ils tweetent, mettent \u00e0 jour leur statut, ils bloguent, ils ont peut-\u00eatre un journal (quelle merveilleuse application que Day One ), ils notent (avec Evernote , OneNote , Keep , etc.), ils r\u00e9digent pour l\u2019\u00e9cole (sur leurs copies num\u00e9riques ), ils font des livres eux-m\u00eames avec un simple traitement de texte (et l\u2019extension idoine ) ou une app comme Bookcreator , ils participent \u00e0 une encyclop\u00e9die libre et gratuite , ils m\u2019\u00e9crivent \u00e0 moi, leur professeur (via le mail, le chat, l\u2019ENT\u2026), etc. Jamais un enfant n\u2019a eu autant besoin de ma\u00eetriser les codes de l\u2019\u00e9crit, de la typographie et de l\u2019orthographe. Il doit avoir du style (au double sens du terme : il use les styles de son traitement de texte et poss\u00e8de une belle plume). Aussi doit-il savoir utiliser dictionnaires num\u00e9riques et logiciels d\u2019aide \u00e0 la r\u00e9daction. Antidote est l\u2019application r\u00eav\u00e9e pour cette ma\u00eetrise du langage. On sait qu\u2019une simple faute d\u2019orthographe dans un tweet peut vous faire devenir la ris\u00e9e du pays tout entier. Quelques personnalit\u00e9s politiques l\u2019ont r\u00e9cemment exp\u00e9riment\u00e9. L\u2019\u00e9l\u00e8ve est polyglotte \u29eb Depuis cette ann\u00e9e, Antidote nous aide \u00e0 mieux \u00e9crire non seulement en fran\u00e7ais mais en anglais. Or j\u2019ai coutume de dire \u00e0 mes \u00e9l\u00e8ves que se couper de l\u2019anglais, c\u2019est se couper d\u2019une partie consid\u00e9rable du web, cette invention et (quasi) propri\u00e9t\u00e9 am\u00e9ricaine. Il existe tant d\u2019informations disponibles en anglais et uniquement en anglais ! Et il existe de si belles applications pour l\u2019apprendre que ce serait un crime de s\u2019en passer. En voici deux : Babbel et English Central . Mais on peut aussi \u00e9voquer Pilipop ou Duolingo , non limit\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019anglais. Mais comme la Chine est le nouveau territoire de jeu des entrepreneurs, je suppose qu\u2019il est temps de proposer l\u2019apprentissage de cette langue. Sur votre clavier virtuel, vous avez d\u00e9j\u00e0 le clavier (les claviers) n\u00e9cessaire(s). Quelle que soit la langue que vous choisirez, pourquoi ne pas utiliser Skype in the classroom ? Vous pouvez m\u00eame jouer au Mystery Skype et trouver une classe dans le monde entier. L\u2019\u00e9l\u00e8ve est un grand lecteur \u29eb J\u2019ai r\u00e9cemment \u00e9crit un article sur le sujet, Qu\u2019est-ce que lire au XXIe si\u00e8cle ? C\u2019est un enjeu majeur tant il est vrai que l\u2019acc\u00e8s au savoir est conditionn\u00e9 par cette comp\u00e9tence. Mais surtout on lit partout, tout le temps. Les fichiers num\u00e9riques (le PDF, le doc, l\u2019odt, le html, l\u2019ePub\u2026) sont commenc\u00e9s ici et termin\u00e9s l\u00e0. L\u2019acte de lire s\u2019est m\u00eame complexifi\u00e9. C\u2019est devenu presque un art \u00e0 part enti\u00e8re que de savoir user de toutes les fonctionnalit\u00e9s li\u00e9es au livre num\u00e9rique : dictionnaire int\u00e9gr\u00e9, possibilit\u00e9 d\u2019annoter, d\u2019affiner sa recherche, etc. Mais il n\u2019y a pas que le livre : lire sur le web est une pratique quasi inconnue de nos \u00e9l\u00e8ves. Combien savent ce qu\u2019est un agr\u00e9gateur de contenus ? Ce qu\u2019est un fichier XML ? Un flux RSS ? Qui conna\u00eet Instapaper ou Pocket ? Combien savent garder, ordonner, retrouver les notes de leur lecture ? Combien savent les partager ? L\u2019\u00e9l\u00e8ve est un \u00eatre sociable \u29eb Le num\u00e9rique est une invitation \u00e0 la promiscuit\u00e9, au vivre ensemble (comme on dit si mal), \u00e0 la sociabilisation. L\u2019\u00e9l\u00e8ve partage et en tire grand b\u00e9n\u00e9fice. S\u2019il lit (m\u00eame un tweet), il le partage. Il \u00e9crit tout un livre ? Il le diffuse sur Wattpad . Il d\u00e9veloppe des connaissances ? Il les offre au regard d\u2019autrui. Il les publie, par exemple sur Vikidia , et comprend que l\u2019\u00e9criture peut-\u00eatre collaborative. Il l\u2019a d\u00e9couvert sur un Pad , il approfondit cette comp\u00e9tence en \u00e9crivant pour et avec autrui. D\u2019ailleurs mon \u00e9l\u00e8ve ne travaille plus jamais seul. Le num\u00e9rique n\u2019est pas une invitation \u00e0 se replier sur soi et sa machine. Il travaille avec les autres. Il apprend \u00e0 d\u00e9l\u00e9guer, \u00e0 s\u2019organiser, \u00e0 faire confiance aux autres, \u00e0 responsabiliser le r\u00e9fractaire, \u00e0 demander de l\u2019aide aux autres. L\u2019\u00e9l\u00e8ve va vers l\u2019autre. Il participe \u00e0 diff\u00e9rents projets que seul le num\u00e9rique a rendu possibles : il cr\u00e9e une web radio , une web TV, des podcasts, etc. Il interviewe des enseignants, des sportifs, des artistes et mobilise de nombreuses comp\u00e9tences pour arriver \u00e0 ses fins. Il sait enregistrer, travailler le son, utiliser des bruitages et agr\u00e9menter son travail d\u2019une musique. C\u2019est pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment ce que nous faisons aussi avec les audiobooks. C\u2019est un bel exemple de travail collaboratif. Je vous en reparlerai. L\u2019\u00e9l\u00e8ve communique \u29eb Il est sur les r\u00e9seaux sociaux et sait que sa parole l\u2019engage. Il diffuse tous azimuts et conna\u00eet les moyens de le faire. De ce point de vue, il sait donc \u00e9crire et en sait suffisamment pour cr\u00e9er son propre blogue. Mais il sait aussi user de tous les moyens que l\u2019on conna\u00eet : les QR-Codes, la r\u00e9alit\u00e9 augment\u00e9e n\u2019ont rien pour lui d\u2019in\u00e9dit. Son quotidien en est envahi et, comme chez Marie Souli\u00e9, les murs de sa classe parlent . L\u2019information est partout et il contribue \u00e0 la transmettre. La Twict\u00e9e est \u00e0 ce propos un enjeu int\u00e9ressant. On fait d\u2019une pierre deux coups en enseignant aux enfants l\u2019orthographe tout en les enjoignant \u00e0 partager ce travail, \u00e0 aider les autres et \u00e0 prendre confiance en eux. Ils ont ainsi franchi des fronti\u00e8res, au sein m\u00eame de leur propre classe, puisque l\u2019on communique avec d\u2019autres classes aux quatre coins du globe. L\u2019utilisation d\u2019Edmodo donne un souffle nouveau aux bonnes vieilles correspondances et les \u00e9changes d\u2019un continent \u00e0 l\u2019autre sont devenus monnaie courante. L\u2019univers de mon \u00e9l\u00e8ve n\u2019est plus la classe, c\u2019est la plan\u00e8te tout enti\u00e8re. Avec sa photo de profil (sa PP comme on dit), il se pr\u00e9sente par del\u00e0 les mers. Mais il ne communique pas seulement, il transmet comme les \u00e9l\u00e8ves de Jul_Dum ses connaissances aux \u00e9l\u00e8ves de primaire : Nos \u00e9l\u00e8ves r\u00e9investissent l\u2019exp\u00e9rience de d\u00e9cantation et de filtrage de l\u2019eau qui est au programme de 5e. Ils se mettent par groupes, refont l\u2019exp\u00e9rience vue en classe avec leur professeur (c\u2019est au programme de 5e) et prennent de nombreuses photos. Ils les trient ensuite, les annotent, et r\u00e9alisent un tutoriel avec l\u2019application BookCreator (1 tutoriel par groupe). Le tutoriel finalis\u00e9, ils \u00e9tablissent collectivement une grille d\u2019\u00e9valuation et reprennent si besoin leur tutoriel en fonction de celle-ci. Les \u00e9l\u00e8ves de primaire viennent ensuite au coll\u00e8ge (c\u2019est pr\u00e9vu pour apr\u00e8s les vacances) pour r\u00e9aliser l\u2019exp\u00e9rience eux-m\u00eames. Ils sont r\u00e9partis par groupe et ont pour seule aide l\u2019un des tutos de nos 5e. Ils doivent refaire l\u2019exp\u00e9rience \u00e9tape par \u00e9tape et de pr\u00e9f\u00e9rence la r\u00e9ussir. Les auteurs du tutoriel qu\u2019ils ont en main les suivent \u00e0 distance pendant ce temps et constatent ou non les failles de leur travail : les primaires arrivent-ils \u00e0 bien s\u00e9lectionner/utiliser le mat\u00e9riel ? ont-ils bien toutes les \u00e9tapes ? L\u2019\u00e9l\u00e8ve manipule l\u2019image \u29eb L\u2019\u00e9l\u00e8ve a acquis une comp\u00e9tence en la mati\u00e8re qui force l\u2019\u00e9tonnement. Via Instagram ou Snapchat, il cadre et applique des filtres autrefois r\u00e9serv\u00e9s \u00e0 quelques happy few (souvenez-vous de la d\u00e9claration du fondateur d\u2019Instagram : \u00ab All Instagram did was take the creative tools that the pros have been using and put them in the hands of the masses \u00bb, cit\u00e9 par Clive Thompson in Smarter than you think ). Il sait souligner les d\u00e9tails et enregistrer la fr\u00eale beaut\u00e9 d\u2019un moment. Il sait produire un bon mash-up capable de susciter le rire sur des questions d\u2019actualit\u00e9. Il use \u00e0 foison des gifs anim\u00e9s qui sont devenus \u00e9galement un moyen de communication (beaucoup plus difficiles \u00e0 filtrer que les textes, rappelle \u00e9galement l\u2019auteur de Smarter than you think , raison pour laquelle ils sont si utilis\u00e9s dans certains pays comme la Chine). Ces quelques exemples ( Me at school , Les profs qui nous mettent des contr\u00f4les \u00e0 la rentr\u00e9e \u2026) sont m\u00eame des invitations \u00e0 repenser notre rapport \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9l\u00e8ve ou \u00e0 notre p\u00e9dagogie\u2026 L\u2019\u00e9l\u00e8ve produit ses propres tutoriels sur YouTube (voir ces vid\u00e9os sur l\u2019utilisation de Scratch ou encore le travail des \u00e9l\u00e8ves de Na\u00efma Horchani Carton ). Il sait ce qu\u2019est un logiciel de montage vid\u00e9o et conna\u00eet diff\u00e9rents formats (et pas seulement du .wma ou de l\u2019.avi). Mais pour faire de la vid\u00e9o, combien il est important de persuader ces jeunes \u00e9l\u00e8ves qu\u2019il faut accepter sa voix et son corps, qu\u2019il faut accepter de se mettre en avant, face \u00e0 une cam\u00e9ra. Que de comp\u00e9tences sont ainsi \u00e0 cr\u00e9er ! Rien que pour faire une vid\u00e9o en classe (comme celle-ci sur les triangles ou celle-l\u00e0 sur les oiseaux ), il faut acqu\u00e9rir les connaissances, organiser ses id\u00e9es, \u00e9crire le script, (se) filmer, monter le film puis diffuser et partager. J\u2019ajouterai que le num\u00e9rique permet de montrer des \u00e9l\u00e8ves osant se mettre en sc\u00e8ne le temps d\u2019une vid\u00e9o, de fa\u00e7on isol\u00e9e et qui n\u2019auraient jamais os\u00e9 le faire face \u00e0 toute une classe. Un enseignant \u00e0 Londres me montrait r\u00e9cemment de jeunes et timides \u00e9l\u00e8ves acceptant de chanter face \u00e0 la cam\u00e9ra. L\u2019an dernier, je d\u00e9couvrais combien ces \u00e9l\u00e8ves \u00e9taient talentueuses. De la m\u00eame fa\u00e7on, j\u2019aimerais mettre en place ce travail : \u00e0 la fin de l\u2019ann\u00e9e, chaque \u00e9l\u00e8ve de ma classe devra faire un talk . En public, il pr\u00e9sentera le sujet de son choix, en s\u2019appuyant sur un diaporama (type PowerPoint) pour \u00e9voquer le sujet de son choix. Merci Ipenou pour cette id\u00e9e ! L\u2019\u00e9l\u00e8ve est conscient des enjeux li\u00e9s au droit \u29eb Mon \u00e9l\u00e8ve sait qu\u2019il a une responsabilit\u00e9, une responsabilit\u00e9 d\u2019autant plus grande qu\u2019il est conscient des abus li\u00e9s au droit d\u2019auteur. Mais de la m\u00eame fa\u00e7on qu\u2019il partage, il est sensible \u00e0 la culture du libre, des notions de standard, d\u2019honn\u00eatet\u00e9 et de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 intellectuelle. Si celle-ci est inali\u00e9nable, il est conscient qu\u2019un enjeu plus vaste le d\u00e9passe et contribue \u00e0 l\u2019enrichissement du bien commun. Il sait donc ce que signifient les Creative Commons et sait utiliser le travail des autres sans se livrer \u00e0 un pillage que d\u2019aucuns ne manqueraient pas de lui reprocher. Mon \u00e9l\u00e8ve sait que ce qu\u2019il \u00e9crit sur Vikidia est lu, et remarqu\u00e9, comment\u00e9 et supprim\u00e9 s\u2019il contrevient aux r\u00e8gles. Il sait que le plagiat est une bien vilaine chose . L\u2019\u00e9l\u00e8ve est un chercheur \u29eb Mon \u00e9l\u00e8ve est un infatigable chercheur et il conna\u00eet les techniques li\u00e9es \u00e0 une bonne et efficace recherche. Il sait utiliser non pas un mais plusieurs moteurs de recherche et affiner sa recherche en recourant \u00e0 tous les outils mis \u00e0 sa disposition (que ce soit en s\u00e9lectionnant telle ou telle option mais aussi en recourant \u00e0 quelques \u00e9l\u00e9ments comme des op\u00e9rateurs bool\u00e9ens ). Il sait aussi remonter \u00e0 la source d\u2019une info, d\u2019une image et ne s\u2019en laisse pas compter par toutes les rumeurs . Il ne me regarde pas comme si j\u2019\u00e9tais Dieu lorsque je lui indique ce qu\u2019on peut faire et surtout trouver d\u2019un simple crtl + f. \u00c0 ce propos, il sait taper sur un clavier. \u00c0 lui les joies de la dactylographie. Il est hors de question de le voir continuer \u00e0 taper \u00e0 deux doigts (grand maximum). Et, comme un vrai codeur, il a les mains riv\u00e9es sur le clavier, usant de tous les raccourcis possibles et imaginables. L\u2019\u00e9l\u00e8ve code (un peu) \u29eb Cet apprentissage du code est passionnant, mais je suis persuad\u00e9 qu\u2019un usage pr\u00e9coce serait contreproductif, en tout cas au primaire voire au coll\u00e8ge. Bon, si vous faites une fixation sur Scratch , je ne peux plus rien pour vous, mais si vous voulez bien comprendre qu\u2019un \u00e9l\u00e8ve n\u2019a aucune id\u00e9e qu\u2019un logiciel peut \u00eatre autre chose que WYSIWYG , vous comprendrez que l\u2019urgence n\u2019est pas \u00e0 la notion de variable ni m\u00eame de programmation. Encore qu\u2019on pourrait envisager une s\u00e9lection pr\u00e9coce des enfants : les litt\u00e9raires d\u2019un c\u00f4t\u00e9, les scientifiques de l\u2019autre, mais ce n\u2019est pas ce qu\u2019on veut. On veut des scientifiques qui ont des id\u00e9es, des scientifiques litt\u00e9raires en somme, des ing\u00e9nieurs sachant s\u2019exprimer et d\u00e9velopper des projets. \u00c0 cet effet, je crois que le plus urgent est que les \u00e9l\u00e8ves voient ce qu\u2019il y a derri\u00e8re le rideau ( the man behind the curtains ). La syntaxe wiki me semble une excellente initiation et on peut embrayer sur le Markdown puis le HTML . \u00c0 partir de l\u00e0, la voie est ouverte. M\u00eame le CSS int\u00e8gre d\u00e9sormais des variables , mais je reste persuad\u00e9 que cet usage doit se d\u00e9velopper au lyc\u00e9e. L\u2019\u00e9l\u00e8ve fait usage de la machine \u29eb Mais avant m\u00eame que l\u2019enfant devienne un petit codeur, il lui faut un minimum de connaissances. De la m\u00eame fa\u00e7on qu\u2019on a con\u00e7u le socle commun cens\u00e9 repr\u00e9senter (\u00e0 la fin de la scolarit\u00e9) le minimum obligatoire, il faudrait concevoir un bagage informatique n\u00e9cessaire. Pour commencer, je suis toujours surpris de constater que, ann\u00e9e apr\u00e8s ann\u00e9e, les \u00e9l\u00e8ves confondent toujours navigateur et moteur de recherche. Ils ne savent pas ce qu\u2019est un client mail, n\u2019ont jamais entendu parler de syst\u00e8me de fichiers, ignorent probablement ce qu\u2019est un OS (a fortiori souverain) ; URL, DNS sont des acronymes abscons, etc. Mais reconnaissons qu\u2019ils le sauraient s\u2019ils manipulaient tout cela un peu plus souvent. Pour l\u2019heure, j\u2019ai vu beaucoup d\u2019\u00e9l\u00e8ves incapables d\u2019enregistrer un fichier, incapables de le retrouver, incapables de le transmettre\u2026 Entendons-nous bien. Je ne les accuse pas d\u2019une nullit\u00e9 d\u00e9plorable. Je constate simplement que certains \u00e9l\u00e8ves ont d\u00e9velopp\u00e9 des connaissances tr\u00e8s sp\u00e9cifiques (par exemple, jouer aux script kiddies), mais ont une connaissance tr\u00e8s vague de principes de base. Ce sont des autodidactes \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9cole ! Finalement, ce dont ils ont besoin, c\u2019est d\u2019une pratique r\u00e9guli\u00e8re de l\u2019ordinateur (ou de la tablette ou du smartphone). Cette pratique, non pas pour elle-m\u00eame, mais pour produire l\u2019un ou l\u2019autre contenu signal\u00e9 ci-dessus dans cet article. Quoi qu\u2019il en soit, vous l\u2019aurez compris, mon \u00e9l\u00e8ve initi\u00e9 au num\u00e9rique est un humaniste : faire preuve de jugement, savoir s\u2019exprimer \u00e0 l\u2019aide de diff\u00e9rents m\u00e9dias, d\u00e9fendre des id\u00e9es de partage, participer au d\u00e9veloppement de projets communs, devenir altruiste\u2026 Voil\u00e0 les objectifs que je propose. Parce qu\u2019 \u00ab Il y a de l\u2019humain derri\u00e8re l\u2019algorithme \u00bb, explique Jean-Baptiste Casaux \u00e0 propos de l\u2019application Citymapper , il est important que l\u2019\u00e9cole formule ses priorit\u00e9s. Il ne saurait \u00eatre question de coder pour coder. L\u2019algorithme peut bien attendre. Si l\u2019on met celui-ci au centre de l\u2019apprentissage, l\u2019humain s\u2019en d\u00e9sint\u00e9ressera. Pourquoi voulez-vous que l\u2019algorithme int\u00e9resse davantage des enfants que la SVT ou la 3e r\u00e9publique ? Avouez que tout cela est un peu plus excitant que de faire bouger une tortue en Logo (poke Phitassel ).

On veut des scientifiques qui ont des id\u00e9es, des scientifiques litt\u00e9raires en somme, des ing\u00e9nieurs sachant s\u2019exprimer et d\u00e9velopper des projets. \u00c0 cet effet, je crois que le plus urgent est que les \u00e9l\u00e8ves voient ce qu\u2019il y a derri\u00e8re le rideau ( the man behind the curtains ).

Pour commencer, je suis toujours surpris de constater que, ann\u00e9e apr\u00e8s ann\u00e9e, les \u00e9l\u00e8ves confondent toujours navigateur et moteur de recherche. Ils ne savent pas ce qu\u2019est un client mail, n\u2019ont jamais entendu parler de syst\u00e8me de fichiers, ignorent probablement ce qu\u2019est un OS (a fortiori souverain) ; URL, DNS sont des acronymes abscons, etc. Mais reconnaissons qu\u2019ils le sauraient s\u2019ils manipulaient tout cela un peu plus souvent.

Ce sont des autodidactes \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9cole ! Finalement, ce dont ils ont besoin, c\u2019est d\u2019une pratique r\u00e9guli\u00e8re de l\u2019ordinateur (ou de la tablette ou du smartphone). Cette pratique, non pas pour elle-m\u00eame, mais pour produire l\u2019un ou l\u2019autre contenu signal\u00e9 ci-dessus dans cet article. Quoi qu\u2019il en soit, vous l\u2019aurez compris, mon \u00e9l\u00e8ve initi\u00e9 au num\u00e9rique est un humaniste : faire preuve de jugement, savoir s\u2019exprimer \u00e0 l\u2019aide de diff\u00e9rents m\u00e9dias, d\u00e9fendre des id\u00e9es de partage, participer au d\u00e9veloppement de projets communs, devenir altruiste\u2026 Voil\u00e0 les objectifs que je propose.

Un vrai luxe par les temps qui court. Luxe qui doit aussi se financer ! C\u2019est donc dans cette double perspective qu\u2019il faut voir ce partenariat avec Amazon. Le reste suivra. Visiblement, les Editions du Net ont d\u00e9j\u00e0 approch\u00e9 Canop\u00e9 \u00e0 ce sujet, effet positif de la concurrence. Et tout y passera aussi sur le versant technique : Linux, Windows, Mac OS, Android, iOS\u2026 M\u00eame pas peur. Tant mieux, car c\u2019est la foire d\u2019empoigne dans un domaine o\u00f9 nos dirigeants sont capables de dire tout et son contraire : inscrivons dans la loi la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 des logiciels libres ; cr\u00e9ons un partenariat avec Microsoft\u2026 Face \u00e0 de telles incoh\u00e9rences, et compte tenu de l\u2019inexistence de moyens acad\u00e9miques permettant de faire le travail, le professeur se d\u00e9brouille seul. \u00c7a tombe bien. C\u2019est ce qu\u2019il a toujours fait. Dans les ann\u00e9es 90 avec son traitement de texte. Aujourd\u2019hui, en cr\u00e9ant son ePub, son iba, son mobi ou son PDF. Parfois en travaillant de concert avec d\u2019autres enseignants (S\u00e9samath, lelivrescolaire.fr) mais enfin il y a de la place pour de petites initiatives ponctuelles, individuelles, quasi artisanales. Et c\u2019est l\u00e0 que l\u2019auto-\u00e9dition prend tout son sens. En dehors de toute politique. C\u2019est comme \u00e7a depuis le d\u00e9but.

I have most of them. I have an iMac, several iPads, a MacBook Air, an iPhone and, at the time of this writing, an Apple Watch which is travelling all around the world. ![[Tableau.jpeg]] I remember me discovering Apple and these lovely white machines when this century had almost 3 or 4 years. As a PC user, I immediately fell in love and bought, as a start, an iPod. Since then, I used to watch every single keynote and I trusted you when you said (actually you weren't, Apple was) that education were in your DNA. I was really convinced that Apple could make a difference when it comes to education. For instance, I did believe that iBooks author would be a revolution in the small world of publishing. That software made me buy an iPad. It wasn't only this beautiful piece of hardware, it was all about creation. I knew I could do great stuff. And I think I did. I wrote several textbooks and, as a trainer, I even went in San Francisco to show how I had created those books. Yes. I was a trainer. An Apple Trainer. Of course I wasn't engaged by you. You only said after a day or two that I could be a part of the programm named Apple Professional Development. You put a label on me and some of your partner were calling me to do some training. When it all begun, I thought it would be great. I would see a lot of people, I could talk about what I love, I would be trained and initiated to the depths of your most complex software. I even thought (I laugh at loud as I write this) that we will get a machine for free in order to demonstrate how great they are. But you are so stingy that you won't even offer your trainer an app that cost 0,99$. Anyway! As an Apple fan boy, I was ready to pay whatever I needed to. As long as I believed I could trust your implication in education, I would do what's necessary. Alas! Things begun to go wrong. The app I used the most was becoming a kind of zombie. iBooks Author or the living dead... The only app that kept its old interface that no other software have anymore. The operating system, Keynote, Pages, Numbers, iMovie and so forth evolved (at a excessive slow pace though) but evolved. Of course, there is now some new templates in iBooks Author and I can export in ePub that no one except Apple can read. But who cares? Where are the new functionalities? It is the same for iBooks. When I open it, I could think we're back in 2010. You were right about dropping skeumorphism but that's all you did. Have your ever read a book on a Kindle? If you do, you will see that you are no more less than a decade late. But the fact is you don't care anymore about books. And, as a teacher, I can't forgive that. I am so disappointed. Moreover, you kicked me out of iBooks about 4 or 5 times sometimes for no reason at all, but that's another story... ![[itunes.jpeg]] Nevertheless, I find some comfort in using iMovie or Garageband. But why the heck are you neglecting books? I can't understand. You did the same with iWeb (and for a glittering of other software) which makes me say that I can not involved myself in products that could have a very short life because of... Of what by the way? Decision made during an administration council? As a matter of fact, all this didn't really affect my interest in Apple. I am still a happy user. And, as I said, I love your products. I'm pretty happy with my iPad Pro and my Pencil. However, I did not buy your smartcase with a keyboard. It is too obvious that you think your customers are cash cows. So, naturally, we have some iPads in our school and guess what? I am the one who is responsible of these machines. Then I discovered the incredible ditch between using an iPad for your own use and deploy them in a school. To put it simply, it is a nightmare. However, I was aware of it. I was no expert but I knew what I was dealing with. In fact, I thought I knew. As we only have 14 iPads, I downloaded Apple Configurator 2, which is pretty simple to use. And then I discovered the pure joy of logging to https://appleid.apple.com , to https://idmsa.apple.com , to https://vpp-fulfill.apple.com/vpp/welcome.html ... I started dreaming about MDM, VPP, Apple ID. What choice do I have to make? A code or a token? If I don't have any MDM, can I use Classroom? Why this guy when I call Apple support tells me one thing when this other one tells me another? Why don't I have any response? Why all my iPads can't be updated all together without getting a failure message? Troubles everywhere. So, to end this too long letter, I am fed up with all of this. Last day, a friend of mine expressed is happiness about Google administration in one web page! In ONE WEB PAGE! How many Chromebooks will I have for 14 iPads that you can't administrate without pulling out you hair? I don't expect an answer but I needed to say all that. I needed to say how badly Apple is missing her educational purposes, how deceiving how all that is. Even Microsoft starts to be more attractive than you are. Word or Onenote have found a way onto my iPad. I have a ton of Google apps. Software are the trojan horse of your own machines.

Je me dis que si j\u2019\u00e9tais dans la m\u00eame situation que lui, je ne serais pas plus avanc\u00e9. Voici la suite du texte ( Wikisource ) : Moi, qui \u00e9tais r\u00e9duit \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tat de pure nature, je sentais que c\u2019\u00e9tait l\u00e0 mon d\u00e9couragement de chaque jour, et d\u2019heure en heure cela m\u2019\u00e9tait devenu plus \u00e9vident, d\u00e8s lors m\u00eame que j\u2019eus recueilli la poign\u00e9e de bl\u00e9, qui comme je l\u2019ai dit, avait cr\u00fb d\u2019une fa\u00e7on si inattendue et si \u00e9merveillante. Premi\u00e8rement je n\u2019avais point de charrue pour labourer la terre, ni de b\u00eache ou de pelle pour la fouir. Il est vrai que je suppl\u00e9ai \u00e0 cela en fabriquant une pelle de bois dont j\u2019ai parl\u00e9 plus haut, mais elle faisait ma besogne grossi\u00e8rement ; et, quoiqu\u2019elle m\u2019e\u00fbt co\u00fbt\u00e9 un grand nombre de jours, comme la pell\u00e2tre n\u2019\u00e9tait point garnie de fer, non-seulement elle s\u2019usa plus t\u00f4t, mais elle rendait mon travail plus p\u00e9nible et tr\u00e8s-imparfait. Mais, r\u00e9sign\u00e9 \u00e0 tout, je travaillais avec patience, et l\u2019insucc\u00e8s ne me rebutait point. Quand mon bl\u00e9 fut sem\u00e9, je n\u2019avais point de herse, je fus oblig\u00e9 de passer dessus moi-m\u00eame et de tra\u00eener une grande et lourde branche derri\u00e8re moi, avec laquelle, pour ainsi dire, j\u2019\u00e9gratignais la terre plut\u00f4t que je ne la hersais ou ratissais. Quand il fut en herbe ou mont\u00e9 en \u00e9pis, comme je l\u2019ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 fait observer, de combien de choses n\u2019eus-je pas besoin pour l\u2019enclore, le pr\u00e9server, le faucher, le moissonner, le transporter au logis, le battre, le vanner et le serrer. Ensuite il me fallut un moulin pour le moudre, des sacs pour bluter la farine, du levain et du sel pour p\u00e9trir ; et enfin un four pour faire cuire le pain, ainsi qu\u2019on pourra le voir dans la suite. Je fus r\u00e9duit \u00e0 faire toutes ces choses sans aucun de ces instruments, et cependant mon bl\u00e9 fut pour moi une source de bien-\u00eatre et de consolation. Ce manque d\u2019instruments, je le r\u00e9p\u00e8te, me rendait toute op\u00e9ration lente et p\u00e9nible, mais il n\u2019y avait \u00e0 cela point de rem\u00e8de. D\u2019ailleurs, mon temps \u00e9tant divis\u00e9, je ne pouvais le perdre enti\u00e8rement. Une portion de chaque jour \u00e9tait donc affect\u00e9e \u00e0 ces ouvrages ; et, comme j\u2019avais r\u00e9solu de ne point faire du pain de mon bl\u00e9 jusqu\u2019\u00e0 ce que j\u2019en eusse une grande provision, j\u2019avais les six mois prochains pour appliquer tout mon travail et toute mon industrie \u00e0 me fournir d\u2019ustensiles n\u00e9cessaires \u00e0 la manutention des grains que je recueillerais pour mon usage.

Pourquoi concourir pour \u00eatre d\u00e9fini comme celui qui innove ? Se distinguer \u29eb Se d\u00e9finir comme enseignant innovant, c\u2019est aussi tendre un miroir \u00e0 ceux qui ne le font pas. C\u2019est dire : \u201cIl y a ceux qui innovent. Et il y a les autres\u201d. Il y a l\u00e0 un petit p\u00e9ch\u00e9 d\u2019orgueil. On distingue ceux qui font du neuf (\u00e9voluent, font table rase, d\u00e9couvrent, prennent des risques, etc.) et ceux qui forc\u00e9ment font du vieux (ressassent, r\u00e9p\u00e8tent, reproduisent, ne se renouvellent pas, se confortent dans, etc.). Or mon credo est que m\u00eame quand je fais du neuf, je fais du vieux. Autrement dit, m\u00eame quand on fait des vid\u00e9os en classe ou que l\u2019on contribue \u00e0 Wikip\u00e9dia, on ne fait que convoquer des savoirs qui, pour l\u2019essentiel, sont des savoirs disciplinaires quasi ancestraux, comme savoir s\u2019exprimer, ordonner son discours, etc. La course \u00e0 la nouveaut\u00e9 \u29eb Quoi de neuf sous le soleil ? demandait d\u00e9j\u00e0 l\u2019Eccl\u00e9siaste.

Certaines de ces innovations prendront d\u2019autant plus vite qu\u2019elles ne font qu\u2019actualiser et r\u00e9interpr\u00e9ter des modalit\u00e9s d\u2019enseignement ou d\u2019apprentissage parfois mill\u00e9naires : H\u00e9rodote et \u00c9rasme pratiquaient la learning exp\u00e9dition ; un directeur de conscience n\u2019a pas grand-chose \u00e0 envier \u00e0 un coach ; le serio ludere du Quattrocento italien pr\u00e9figure les serious games du XXIe si\u00e8cle ; C\u00e9lestin Freinet n\u2019avait pas besoin de Twitter pour faire correspondre les \u00e9l\u00e8ves ; la flipped classroom (classe invers\u00e9e) avec son \u00ab professeur-pr\u00e9cepteur \u00bb n\u2019est pas tr\u00e8s \u00e9loign\u00e9e du fonctionnement du lyc\u00e9e du XIXe si\u00e8cle\u2026 Les termes ont chang\u00e9, pas les grands ressorts de la p\u00e9dagogie.

Ce n\u2019est rien moins qu\u2019un instrument de marketing, comme sait si bien le faire l\u2019industrie du num\u00e9rique en mettant sur le march\u00e9 un nouveau produit plus ceci, plus cela.

Les Anciens et les Modernes. Les digital natives et les digital immigrants. La gauche et la droite. Le SNALC et l\u2019UNSA. On passe notre temps \u00e0 diviser en deux les choses, comme un beau symbole dont les deux moiti\u00e9s sont ou devraient \u00eatre compl\u00e9mentaires (cf. l\u2019\u00e9tymologie du mot \u201csymbole\u201d ).

Cette application m\u00e9riterait \u00e0 elle seule tout un article. Mais je dirai simplement que pouvoir \u00e9crire un texte format\u00e9 en Markdown et pouvoir en deux clics produire un document docx ou PDF ou HTML ou ePub, sans avoir \u00e0 retravailler le m\u00eame texte et donc en une seul fois, a achev\u00e9 de me conqu\u00e9rir. On peut m\u00eame dans la foul\u00e9e publier sur son Wordpress et Medium. Le bonheur int\u00e9gral. Pour bien le comprendre, imaginez qu'auparavant j'\u00e9crivais sur un traitement de texte pour imprimer le document \u00e0 transmettre aux \u00e9l\u00e8ves ; je transf\u00e9rais le tout dans mon application pour faire un iBooks ; je publiais un extrait sur mon Wordpress apr\u00e8s m'\u00eatre rendu sur Wordpress puis \u00e9ventuellement j'allais sur Medium pour copier coller ce m\u00eame extrait et \u00e0 chaque fois il fallait rajouter les images, remettre en gras, remettre en italique, refaire les liens, etc. Maintenant avec Ulysses, je le fais une fois et c'est publi\u00e9 partout. Et tout \u00e7a \u00e0 partir de mon iPad. \ud83d\ude0d Si l'un d'entre vous est arriv\u00e9 \u00e0 la fin de ce billet, il se demandera comment je retouche les images qui pars\u00e8ment mes manuels. Eh bien pour cela, comme sur le Mac, un simple navigateur suffit. Et si j'ai des choses un peu plus complexes \u00e0 faire, j'ai recours \u00e0 Pixelmator . Pas plus tard qu'hier, je me suis livr\u00e9 \u00e0 un d\u00e9tourage effr\u00e9n\u00e9 avec autant de facilit\u00e9 que son mon Mac et sa souris.

J'ai choisi le Keys-to-go de Logitech . Depuis que iOS 9 a int\u00e9gr\u00e9 les raccourcis avec claviers externes dignes d'un ordinateur de bureau, on gagne en productivit\u00e9. Je retrouve les joies du \u2318 + \u21e7 ou du \u2318 + \u2192 , pour ne prendre que quelques exemples, bref de beaucoup de ces raccourcis qui me permettent de garder les mains sur le clavier et d'\u00e9viter de les lever et de toucher l'\u00e9cran.

Mais je dirai simplement que pouvoir \u00e9crire un texte format\u00e9 en Markdown et pouvoir en deux clics produire un document docx ou PDF ou HTML ou ePub, sans avoir \u00e0 retravailler le m\u00eame texte et donc en une seul fois, a achev\u00e9 de me conqu\u00e9rir. On peut m\u00eame dans la foul\u00e9e publier sur son Wordpress et Medium. Le bonheur int\u00e9gral. Pour bien le comprendre, imaginez qu'auparavant j'\u00e9crivais sur un traitement de texte pour imprimer le document \u00e0 transmettre aux \u00e9l\u00e8ves ; je transf\u00e9rais le tout dans mon application pour faire un iBooks ; je publiais un extrait sur mon Wordpress apr\u00e8s m'\u00eatre rendu sur Wordpress puis \u00e9ventuellement j'allais sur Medium pour copier coller ce m\u00eame extrait et \u00e0 chaque fois il fallait rajouter les images, remettre en gras, remettre en italique, refaire les liens, etc. Maintenant avec Ulysses, je le fais une fois et c'est publi\u00e9 partout. Et tout \u00e7a \u00e0 partir de mon iPad. \ud83d\ude0d Si l'un d'entre vous est arriv\u00e9 \u00e0 la fin de ce billet, il se demandera comment je retouche les images qui pars\u00e8ment mes manuels. Eh bien pour cela, comme sur le Mac, un simple navigateur suffit. Et si j'ai des choses un peu plus complexes \u00e0 faire, j'ai recours \u00e0 Pixelmator . Pas plus tard qu'hier, je me suis livr\u00e9 \u00e0 un d\u00e9tourage effr\u00e9n\u00e9 avec autant de facilit\u00e9 que son mon Mac et sa souris. Mais avec le Pencil. \ud83e\udd17 ![[Detourage.jpeg]] Bref l'iPad, c'est la machine \u00e0 \u00e9crire du XXIe si\u00e8cle. Je lui ai quand m\u00eame ajout\u00e9 un clavier. J'ai choisi le Keys-to-go de Logitech . Depuis que iOS 9 a int\u00e9gr\u00e9 les raccourcis avec claviers externes dignes d'un ordinateur de bureau, on gagne en productivit\u00e9. Je retrouve les joies du \u2318 + \u21e7 ou du \u2318 + \u2192 , pour ne prendre que quelques exemples, bref de beaucoup de ces raccourcis qui me permettent de garder les mains sur le clavier et d'\u00e9viter de les lever et de toucher l'\u00e9cran. Et quand il faut vraiment le faire, on peut \u00e9viter un peu de fatigue musculaire \u00e0 saisir le Pencil et \u00e0 l'utiliser pour naviguer dans l'iPad. ![[RaccourcisClavier.jpeg]] Ainsi, dans quelques mois, vous pourrez lire le premier manuel scolaire fait enti\u00e8rement sur un iPad et en Markdown. \ud83c\udf78\ud83c\udf7e ![[CouvertureProvisoire.jpeg]]","title":"Le Markdown, graal des enseignants"},{"location":"%C3%89criture/Medium/La%20Silicon%20Valley%2C%20les%20parents%2C%20leurs%20enfants%20et%20le%20num%C3%A9rique/","tags":["Medium"],"text":"Lien Source de l'illustration Les contempteurs du num\u00e9rique \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9cole ont cru pouvoir trouver chez les dirigeants de la Silicon Valley mettant leurs enfants dans des \u00e9coles traditionnelles un nouvel argument en faveur de leur th\u00e8se. En 2014, un article du NewYork Times r\u00e9v\u00e9lait que, chez Steve Jobs, il n\u2019y avait aucune des machines produites par Apple. Le journaliste demandant si les enfants de Jobs aimaient l\u2019iPad, Jobs r\u00e9pondait qu\u2019ils ne l\u2019avaient pas utilis\u00e9 et ajoutait : \u00ab Nous limitons l\u2019utilisation de la technologie par les enfants \u00e0 la maison \u00bb. Le CEO d\u2019Apple tenait ces propos en 2010 et il faut bien reconna\u00eetre qu\u2019\u00e0 cette \u00e9poque, mes enfants non plus n\u2019avaient jamais utilis\u00e9 d\u2019iPad\u2026 Et Jobs disait \u00ab nous limitons \u00bb, pas \u00bb nous interdisons \u00bb... D\u00e8s 2011, le journaliste Nick Bilton avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 interrog\u00e9 quelques dirigeants de la Silicon Valley. Ainsi, l\u2019ancien r\u00e9dacteur en chef du magazine Wired et directeur de 3D Robotics affirmait conna\u00eetre les risques de la technologie et ne pas vouloir exposer ses enfants. Et l\u2019homme d\u2019\u00e9voquer la triade traditionnelle de la pornographie, du harc\u00e8lement et de l\u2019addiction. Un autre article du NewYork Times citait ces propos d\u2019un employ\u00e9 de Google : \u00ab Nous rendons la technologie aussi facile \u00e0 utiliser que l\u2019on peut \u00bb (l\u2019expression \u00ab as brain-dead easy to use \u00bb est difficile \u00e0 rendre). Et il ajoute : \u00ab Il n\u2019y a pas de raison que les enfants n\u2019y parviennent pas quand ils seront plus grands \u00bb\u2026 En lisant ces lignes, je ne peux pas m\u2019emp\u00eacher de penser encore \u00e0 Socrate citant les propos de Thamos : \u00ab tel est capable de cr\u00e9er des arts mais [\u2026] tel autre est \u00e0 m\u00eame de juger de leur utilit\u00e9 ou de leur nocivit\u00e9 \u00bb. Il faut croire que du c\u00f4t\u00e9 de la Californie, on ne d\u00e9roge pas \u00e0 la r\u00e8gle. Comment peut-on \u00e0 ce point \u00eatre aveugle et voir ses propres enfants comme des futurs consommateurs de Google \u00ab as brain-dead easy to use \u00bb ? Un de ces parents (mais nous \u00e9tions en 2014) pr\u00f4nait m\u00eame l\u2019usage de Snapchat, car il lui semblait qu\u2019un tel r\u00e9seau social ne garderait pas ind\u00e9finiment des donn\u00e9es qui survivraient des ann\u00e9es durant et pourraient \u00e9ventuellement vous embarrasser plus tard. Las ! On voit l\u00e0 qu\u2019on peut commettre de graves erreurs de jugement y compris quand on est de la partie\u2026 Heureusement, il n\u2019est que de revenir au premier article pour s\u2019apercevoir que tous les parents millionnaires de la high-tech ne sont pas si obtus et se contentent d\u2019\u00e9tablir des r\u00e8gles qui ne me choquent aucunement. Par exemple, les \u00e9crans sont bannis de la chambre. Ou encore on distingue le temps pass\u00e9 \u00e0 consommer de l\u2019\u00e9cran (regarder YouTube ou jouer \u00e0 des jeux vid\u00e9o) et cr\u00e9er du contenu (faire du montage vid\u00e9o, apprendre \u00e0 programmer). L\u2019ancien CEO de Twitter reconnaissait m\u00eame que l\u2019interdiction \u00e0 tout va serait contre-productive et se demandait quelle serait l\u2019attitude de ses enfants plus tard d\u00e9couvrant la technologie. C\u2019est le moins que l\u2019on puisse se demander quand on se pose la question de l\u2019\u00e9ducation de ses enfants et qu'on ne souhaite pas les maintenir dans un monde qui n\u2019existe pas. \u00c0 ce propos, les \u00e9coles Waldorf dans lesquelles certains de ces dirigeants mettent leurs enfants ne sauraient \u00eatre tenues pour des mod\u00e8les par ceux qui en France d\u00e9clarent que le num\u00e9rique est nocif, \u00e0 moins qu\u2019ils admettent que labourer un champ ou tricoter des chaussettes constitue une n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 scolaire \u00e0 19 000 euros l\u2019ann\u00e9e . Et l\u2019attirance pour le style r\u00e9tro d\u2019une vie simple avec des \u00e9tag\u00e8res en bois, un tableau noir et des craies, des stylos (notez que tout cela n\u2019est pas bien loin de ce qui caract\u00e9rise la plupart de nos \u00e9coles) n\u2019est que l\u2019effet d\u2019une nostalgie d\u2019un monde qui a la douceur d\u2019antan.

Ce dernier y vit confortablement, jouissant d'un confort que les turpitudes du monde ext\u00e9rieur ne viennent pas perturber. Puis un jour Gandalf arrive. Et l'aventure avec lui. Dans Le Seigneur des anneaux , il en va de m\u00eame. Frodon, un hobbit toujours, va devoir quitter sa comt\u00e9 et aller au devant du danger. Il s'agit encore de quitter son confort, mais contrairement au volume pr\u00e9c\u00e9dent, il ne s'agit pas de partir \u00e0 la recherche d'un tr\u00e9sor, mais de d\u00e9truire celui-ci. C'est une qu\u00eate invers\u00e9e. C'est l'envers de L'\u00cele au tr\u00e9sor . On ne veut pas du tr\u00e9sor, du pr\u00e9cieux . On veut s'en d\u00e9barrasser. J'ai toujours per\u00e7u - m\u00eame confus\u00e9ment dans ma jeunesse - qu'il y avait l\u00e0 quelque all\u00e9gorie, quelque sens secret, assez \u00e9vident. Mais je lui donne aujourd'hui un sens nouveau assez proche de la parabole des talents . Le talent est une pi\u00e8ce de monnaie . Elle n'est certes pas en or (encore qu'\u00e0 lire le Dictionnaire historique de la langue fran\u00e7aise, les choses ne soient pas si simples), mais le discours biblique nous invite \u00e0 faire fructifier cet avoir (de cette parabole nous vient d'ailleurs le mot \"talent\", le don, la disposition, l'aptitude). On peut le faire fructifier de multiples fa\u00e7ons. Selon saint Jean Chrysostome, il faut par ce mot de talent \u00ab entendre tout ce par quoi chacun peut contribuer \u00e0 l'avantage de son fr\u00e8re, soit en le soutenant de son autorit\u00e9, soit en l'aidant de son argent, soit en l'assistant de ses conseils par un \u00e9change fructueux de parole, soit en lui rendant tous les autres services qu'on est capable de lui rendre. \u00bb ( Wikip\u00e9dia ) \"par un \u00e9change fructueux de parole\"... N'est-ce pas l\u00e0 ce qui caract\u00e9rise les r\u00e9seaux sociaux ? Des \u00e9changes fructueux de parole ? Le social se traduisant par du logos . Ou plut\u00f4t devrais-je \u00e9crire \"ce qui devrait caract\u00e9riser\" les r\u00e9seaux sociaux ? Mais on sait bien que ce n'est pas le cas. On ne peut pas s'y exprimer sans s'attirer les sarcasmes d'un illettr\u00e9. On a vu des enseignants appeler au viol et au meurtre. Le racisme et l'intol\u00e9rance s'y affichent avec d\u00e9lectation. Marine Le Pen a un million d'abonn\u00e9s. Bien souvent, je me dis : \"Mais que fais-je l\u00e0 ?\" En ce cas, je prends mon \"talent\" qui, en toute modestie, n'est qu'un bienveillant babillage.

C\u2019\u00e9tait le printemps arabe. La r\u00e9volution iranienne. Les \u00e9lecteurs s\u2019opposaient \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9lection de Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. Et c\u2019est pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment \u00e0 ce moment-l\u00e0 que j\u2019ai compris \u2014 tardivement il est vrai \u2014 l\u2019importance de Twitter. C\u2019\u00e9tait sur ce r\u00e9seau que l\u2019information circulait. Face \u00e0 la r\u00e9pression exerc\u00e9e par les autorit\u00e9s, Twitter apparaissait comme un espace de libert\u00e9. Twitter s\u2019affirmait enfin comme le concurrent des m\u00e9dias traditionnels. La cha\u00eene CNN \u00e9tant indiff\u00e9rente \u00e0 ce qui se passait en Iran, on disait alors : \u00ab La r\u00e9volution ne sera pas t\u00e9l\u00e9vis\u00e9e, elle sera twitteris\u00e9e \u00bb. http://www.liberation.fr/planete/2009/06/15/iran-la-revolution-twitter_564866 R\u00e9volution, politique, printemps, libert\u00e9, r\u00e9seau, information\u2026 Il n\u2019en fallait pas plus pour me s\u00e9duire. Et j\u2019\u00e9tais s\u00e9duit. Et pas qu\u2019un peu. Facebook m\u2019indiff\u00e9rait, Twitter allait me passionner avec ses RT, ses hashtags, ses FF, etc. Et ce r\u00e9seau a \u00e9t\u00e9 une mine d\u2019informations comme je n\u2019en avais jamais vu. C\u2019\u00e9tait mieux que les flux RSS. C\u2019\u00e9tait mieux que la r\u00e9publique des blogs. Les gens \u00e9taient excessivement sympas. On s\u2019entraidait. On raillait dans un esprit potache. Bref, c\u2019\u00e9tait bien. \u00c7a a dur\u00e9 quelques ann\u00e9es. De nombreuses choses indiquaient ce qu\u2019allait devenir ce r\u00e9seau. D\u2019abord, il y a eu les gourous de l\u2019oiseau bleu : ses avocats, ses starlettes et ses journalistes aux centaines de milliers d\u2019abonn\u00e9s et au nombre inversement proportionnel d\u2019abonnements. Ce d\u00e9s\u00e9quilibre \u00e9tait un premier camouflet inflig\u00e9 \u00e0 Twitter. Ce r\u00e9seau qui avait bris\u00e9 l\u2019in\u00e9galit\u00e9 m\u00e9dia/spectateurs (ceux qui s\u2019expriment, ceux qui regardent) allait le recr\u00e9er. L\u2019aspiration d\u00e9mocratique prenait fin. Ce n\u2019\u00e9tait pas pour me d\u00e9ranger. En fait, je m\u2019en fichais compl\u00e8tement. J\u2019ai rapidement arr\u00eat\u00e9 de suivre les stars de Twitter, comprenant bien qu\u2019on ne deviserait pas gaiement de tout et de rien, qu\u2019ils n\u2019avaient rien \u00e0 me dire et que je n\u2019allais pas les suivre comme on regarde le JT de TF1. Et les choses ont continu\u00e9 comme elles avaient commenc\u00e9. J\u2019ai discut\u00e9, \u00e9chang\u00e9 comme on dit (emploi absolu du verbe). Et c\u2019\u00e9tait chouette. Profs (beaucoup de profs), infirmi\u00e8res, informaticiens, quelques journalistes quand m\u00eame. Beaucoup de monde d\u2019horizons diff\u00e9rents. Beaucoup de rencontres aussi. Et des voyages. Le virtuel ne s\u2019est jamais oppos\u00e9 au r\u00e9el sur Twitter. Et puis insensiblement, quelque chose s\u2019est pass\u00e9. Je n\u2019\u00e9tais pas sp\u00e9cialement un early adopter. Twitter est apparu en 2006. Mais enfin, en 2009, on \u00e9tait entre nous. On \u00e9tait les happy few et on \u00e9tait peinard. Cela a dur\u00e9 quelques ann\u00e9es. Puis le r\u00e9seau a continu\u00e9 de grossir. Beaucoup de gens sont arriv\u00e9s l\u00e0. Il y a eu des personnalit\u00e9s politiques qui ont fini par comprendre qu\u2019il fallait y \u00eatre. C\u2019est l\u2019\u00e8re des community managers et des publicitaires. En fait, ce n\u2019\u00e9tait pas vraiment une nouveaut\u00e9 que cette venue sur Twitter de gens qui n\u2019\u00e9taient pas exactement l\u00e0 pour tailler le bout de gras, mais pour se faire de la pub ou vanter les m\u00e9rites de tel produit (d\u2019ailleurs, Twitter a fini par mettre de la pub dans nos TL). Il y en avait d\u00e8s le d\u00e9but. Un de mes premiers abonn\u00e9s Twitter devait \u00eatre un compte li\u00e9 \u00e0 la pornographie. Mais surtout, \u00e0 un moment, les gens se sont mis \u00e0 r\u00e2ler pour tout et pour rien : le burkini, le jargon, la p\u00e9dagogie, la politique\u2026 Tout est pr\u00e9texte \u00e0 s\u2019indigner, \u00e0 pousser de hauts cris. J\u2019en profite pour faire mon mea culpa. J\u2019y ai bien particip\u00e9. Mais entre r\u00e2ler gentiment et taper \u00e0 boulet rouge sur tout ce qui n\u2019est pas soi, il y a tout un \u00e9cart qui est abyssal. L\u2019unique objectif de certaines personnes est de m\u00e9priser, insulter, railler, moquer, provoquer. Il semble que beaucoup de gens sur Twitter ne soient l\u00e0 que pour emmerder les autres. Ils n\u2019ont rien \u00e0 dire, rien \u00e0 faire. Ils sont juste l\u00e0 pour se payer votre tronche (ils me font d\u2019ailleurs penser \u00e0 South Park). Certains ont m\u00eame deux, trois, quatre comptes pour \u00eatre s\u00fbrs que vous ne manquiez pas ce qu\u2019ils ont \u00e0 vous dire. Ce comportement s\u2019est amplifi\u00e9 chez les profs avec la r\u00e9forme du coll\u00e8ge. Les sensibilit\u00e9s se sont exacerb\u00e9es. Les uns hurlent leur indignation, les autres s\u2019indignent encore plus fort. \u00c0 partir de l\u00e0, je vous renvoie \u00e0 un billet que j\u2019avais \u00e9crit et qui est intitul\u00e9 La tentation du Hobbit. https://medium.com/@yannhoury/la-tentation-du-hobbit-c097cfa09453#.fifoozjzb Si vous n\u2019allez pas lire ce billet, je vous cite ce passage qui a \u00e0 peu pr\u00e8s la m\u00eame teneur que celui que vous \u00eates en train de lire : \u00ab On ne peut pas s\u2019y exprimer sans s\u2019attirer les sarcasmes d\u2019un illettr\u00e9. On a vu des enseignants appeler au viol et au meurtre. Le racisme et l\u2019intol\u00e9rance s\u2019y affichent avec d\u00e9lectation. Marine Le Pen a un million d\u2019abonn\u00e9s. \u00bb Alors je m\u2019en vais. On m\u2019a bien sugg\u00e9r\u00e9 d\u2019\u00eatre indiff\u00e9rent aux attaques personnelles, de ne pas y r\u00e9pondre, d\u2019ignorer les invectives. J\u2019ai tent\u00e9 ces derniers jours de tweeter des trucs qui n\u2019int\u00e9ressaient absolument personne, mes lectures essentiellement. Et puis, l\u2019erreur ! j\u2019ai exprim\u00e9 un truc plus personnel. Alors, je me suis rappel\u00e9 le vieux dicton \u00ab Don\u2019t feed the troll \u00bb. Et la meilleure mani\u00e8re de ne pas alimenter les trolls, c\u2019est encore de n\u2019\u00eatre pas l\u00e0. Quand ceux-ci se trouveront tout seuls, ils n\u2019auront plus rien, plus une personne pour exprimer leur d\u00e9testation de tout. ![[au-revoir.jpeg]]","title":"Pourquoi je quitte Twitter"},{"location":"%C3%89criture/Medium/Pourquoi%20lire%20avec%20Amazon%20%3F/","text":"Lien ![[kindle-dico.jpeg]] Quand il est question de lecture et qu\u2019on en vient au bon vieux d\u00e9bat livre papier vs livre num\u00e9rique, d\u2019aucuns ont le sentiment qu\u2019on peut exp\u00e9dier la question en opposant simplement le livre papier au livre num\u00e9rique, comme si le 2e \u00e9tait une vulgaire r\u00e9plique du 1er. En moins bien. Ce ne serait qu\u2019un \u00e9cran forc\u00e9ment nuisible (aux yeux, \u00e0 la concentration, \u00e0 l\u2019intelligence) encastr\u00e9 dans un m\u00e9prisable \u00e9crin de plastique. Les tenants du 1er ont le sentiment d\u2019avoir tout dit quand ils d\u00e9clarent leur amour pour le papier. Et les 2ds sont renvoy\u00e9s \u00e0 la froideur de leur appareil d\u2019o\u00f9 serait absent le plaisir de tourner les pages, d\u2019avoir un poids dans la main et puis on ne sait trop quoi d\u2019ind\u00e9finissable qui ferait autorit\u00e9 du fond des \u00e2ges. Peut-\u00eatre l\u2019industrie du livre num\u00e9rique est-elle responsable de cet \u00e9tat de fait ? En popularisant le livre num\u00e9rique, on a voulu que celui-ci soit une r\u00e9plique du livre papier. Et en effet, avec certaines applications, on peut tourner des pages, ce qui n\u2019a aucun sens, mais cela rappelle le bon livre papier. \u00c7a r\u00e9conforte. C\u2019\u00e9tait la mode du skeuomorphisme. Cela dit, il \u00e9tait absolument n\u00e9cessaire que l\u2019on retrouve ce \u00e0 quoi on \u00e9tait habitu\u00e9. De plus, il \u00e9tait inconcevable que le livre num\u00e9rique ne soit pas en mesure d\u2019apporter du haut de sa superbe technologique tout ce que le papier pouvait apporter. Il fallait donc que l\u2019on puisse souligner. Cela va de soi. Il fallait aussi que l\u2019on puisse gribouiller quelque chose dans la marge ou m\u00eame placer un marque-page. Mais le num\u00e9rique ne pouvait se contenter de singer son illustre pr\u00e9d\u00e9cesseur. Il fallait qu\u2019il fasse mieux, m\u00eame pour ce que l\u2019on \u00e9tait accoutum\u00e9 \u00e0 faire depuis des ann\u00e9es. Le livre num\u00e9rique se devait d\u2019am\u00e9liorer significativement l\u2019exp\u00e9rience de la lecture. C\u2019est ce que permet une Kindle. D\u00e9finir \u29eb Si l\u2019on tapote sur un mot, on peut faire appara\u00eetre sa d\u00e9finition gr\u00e2ce au dictionnaire int\u00e9gr\u00e9 . On n\u2019a pas besoin d\u2019interrompre sa lecture pour prendre un dictionnaire. De plus, le dictionnaire peut \u00eatre multilingue . Si vous lisez en anglais ou en chinois, votre dictionnaire sera en anglais ou en chinois. On peut m\u00eame choisir d\u2019 enregistrer le vocabulaire recherch\u00e9 dans le dictionnaire. On trouve alors dans sa biblioth\u00e8que un nouveau livre contenant les mots ayant fait l\u2019objet d\u2019une recherche. C\u2019est tr\u00e8s pratique pour r\u00e9viser, une fois la lecture termin\u00e9e. Deux autres possibilit\u00e9s accompagnent l\u2019irruption du dictionnaire : l\u2019acc\u00e8s \u00e0 Wikip\u00e9dia et \u00e0 la traduction . L\u2019encyclop\u00e9die vient id\u00e9alement compl\u00e9ter les informations transmises par le dictionnaire et si celui-ci ne vous permet pas de comprendre la d\u00e9finition dans la langue d\u2019origine d\u2019un mot de vocabulaire inconnu, alors le traducteur se chargera de vous y aider. La Kindle est donc \u00e0 elle seule une incitation \u00e0 lire dans une langue \u00e9trang\u00e8re.

Pourtant, j'avais commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 \u00e9prouver quelques soup\u00e7ons quand je lisais sous la plume de gens sens\u00e9s que le savoir est sur internet et qu'il n'est plus besoin d'apprendre. Les modes me h\u00e9rissent le poil quand elles s'imposent en d\u00e9pit de la r\u00e9alit\u00e9 (je n'ose \u00e9crire \u00ab du bon sens \u00bb). Vouloir que les \u00e9l\u00e8ves apprennent le PHP d\u00e8s la maternelle est une de ces modes. La classe invers\u00e9e en est une autre. J'ai m\u00eame lu sur Twitter qu'une enseignante recherchait des t\u00e9moignages de classe invers\u00e9e en CP . Sinc\u00e8rement, je me suis demand\u00e9 si je devenais fou... Et puis la volont\u00e9 \u00e9tatique de diffuser les bonnes pratiques dans le cadre du num\u00e9rique \u00e0 l'\u00e9cole est l'occasion de mettre des enseignants en avant. On les d\u00e9clare innovants (ce qu'ils ne sont pas, je l'ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9crit ). On les montre. On les exhibe. Les autres sont pri\u00e9s de faire cours. Les egos sont bless\u00e9s. Avant cela, les r\u00e9seaux sociaux les ont exacerb\u00e9s. De surcro\u00eet, la promesse du num\u00e9rique scolaire fait briller nos petits yeux d'enseignants. On va voir ce qu'on va voir. Les faibles deviendront forts. Les injustices seront battues en br\u00e8che. On va diff\u00e9rencier. On pr\u00e9parera pendant 18 heures pour une heure devant les \u00e9l\u00e8ves. On se servira de Plickers et l'on sera distingu\u00e9 pour cela au plus sommet de l'\u00e9tat. Et quand, charg\u00e9 de toutes les promesses de l'avenir, on s'en retournera en classe, on recommencera \u00e0 affronter le regard morne d'Enzo ou Dylan qui, pardonnez-moi l'expression, n'en ont rien \u00e0 battre. En somme, on tente de faire entrer le num\u00e9rique \u00e0 l'\u00e9cole \u00e0 coups de forceps (ce que je peux concevoir), mais \u00e0 quel prix ! Je l'ai dit dans mon livre. L'\u00e9cole que je souhaite ne prone ni l'apprentissage du PHP \u00e0 six ans qui se ferait en inversant la classe par un enseignant affubl\u00e9 de paillettes. Mais ce qui me choque dans tout cela, c'est qu'on se demande rarement ce qu'en pense l'\u00e9l\u00e8ve. J'ai toujours vu le num\u00e9rique \u00e0 travers le prisme de l'enseignant. J'ai toujours fait porter sur sa seule personne le poids de sa non-adoption. Je me disais que si l'\u00e9cole n'\u00e9tait pas encore entr\u00e9e dans l'\u00e8re du num\u00e9rique , c'est que la faute en incombait aux enseignants r\u00e9calcitrants. Je per\u00e7ois aujourd'hui mon erreur. Je per\u00e7ois \u00e0 quel point j'ai oubli\u00e9 la part qui incombe aux \u00e9l\u00e8ves. \u00c0 force de les pr\u00e9senter comme des digital natives , comme la g\u00e9n\u00e9ration Y ou Z, j'ai toujours eu le sentiment (\u00e0 tort bien s\u00fbr) que les \u00e9l\u00e8ves appelaient le num\u00e9rique de toute leur \u00e2me. Comme si en son absence, il devrait forc\u00e9ment leur manquer un \u00e9l\u00e9ment essentiel du monde auquel ils appartiennent. Un peu comme si on faisait cours sans \u00e9lectricit\u00e9. Son absence devrait \u00eatre un scandale, une d\u00e9chirure inacceptable. Pour un nombre important d'\u00e9l\u00e8ves, il n'en est rien. Pour nombre d'\u00e9l\u00e8ves (en quelle quantit\u00e9, je n'en sais rien), le num\u00e9rique est tout \u00e0 fait superf\u00e9tatoire. On peut imaginer quelques raisons plus ou moins \u00e9videntes. Le num\u00e9rique n'est qu'un divertissement (il sert \u00e0 regarder des vid\u00e9os ou des snaps). Peut-\u00eatre n'est-il l'objet que d'un faible int\u00e9r\u00eat (au regard d'une passion plus forte et exclusive comme la p\u00eache ou le sport par exemple) voire d'un d\u00e9sint\u00e9r\u00eat total. D'aucuns n'ont que m\u00e9pris pour une machine dont il ne voit pas l'utilit\u00e9. Je ne me suis rendu compte de tout cela que tr\u00e8s r\u00e9cemment. Il faut dire que \u00e7a ne fait que deux ans que j'ai des classes enti\u00e8rement \u00e9quip\u00e9es. Auparavant, BYOD et salle informatique \u00e9taient mes seuls recours. C'\u00e9tait un peu de num\u00e9rique dans un monde tout \u00e0 fait traditionnel. Aujourd'hui, j'ai deux classes dont les \u00e9l\u00e8ves sont enti\u00e8rement \u00e9quip\u00e9s d'ordinateurs par le Conseil d\u00e9partemental. Dans notre coll\u00e8ge, nous avons aussi une classe mobile constitu\u00e9e de 14 iPad. Or le num\u00e9rique ne fait pas pour autant l'unanimit\u00e9. Ni chez les enseignants, ni chez les \u00e9l\u00e8ves, ni chez les parents. Mais en y r\u00e9fl\u00e9chissant, je me rappelle que \u00e7a fait tr\u00e8s longtemps que les choses sont compliqu\u00e9es. Je me souviens de parents qui m'avaient reproch\u00e9 mes vell\u00e9it\u00e9s d'inversion de la classe. C'\u00e9tait il y a au moins 5 ans. Ils refusaient absolument que leurs enfants passent du temps sur l'ordinateur \u00e0 regarder une vid\u00e9o expliquant un point de grammaire. J'ai essuy\u00e9 depuis bien d'autres reproches. Ces derniers temps, j'ai tent\u00e9 de mener mes lectures analytiques selon la m\u00e9thode expliqu\u00e9e dans la carte mentale ci-dessous. Le succ\u00e8s est pour le moins mitig\u00e9 et cela inqui\u00e8te certains \u00e9l\u00e8ves. Par ailleurs, on utilise massivement Evernote pour y consigner la totalit\u00e9 de nos cours. Cela inqui\u00e8te les parents. On m'a m\u00eame reproch\u00e9 d'avoir envoy\u00e9 un message \u00e0 un \u00e9l\u00e8ve un dimanche pour lui rappeler de me rendre un travail que j'attendais depuis deux mois. Message envoy\u00e9 pour inviter l'\u00e9l\u00e8ve \u00e0 rendre son travail et \u00e9viter une note bien mauvaise, juste avant l'arr\u00eat des notes. Aujourd'hui, je me rends compte qu'on ne peut pas mentionner Wikip\u00e9dia sans qu'une horde d'\u00e9l\u00e8ves se r\u00e9crient et clament d'une seule voix : \u00ab Mais sur Wikip\u00e9dia, il y a des choses fausses ! \u00bb et \u00e0 chaque fois que je leur demande qui leur a dit ces \u00e2neries, ils me r\u00e9pondent que c'est tel ou tel coll\u00e8gue. Et je d\u00e9couvre (avec d'autant plus de stupeur que j'ai mis du temps \u00e0 m'en rendre compte) qu'en voulant \u00e0 tout prix inculquer une culture num\u00e9rique \u00e0 mes \u00e9l\u00e8ves, en promouvant certaines p\u00e9dagogies actives par le biais du num\u00e9rique, je fais tout simplement fausse route. Alors, bien s\u00fbr, j'ai eu quelques moments de grands bonheurs , mais rapport\u00e9s aux soucis \u00e9voqu\u00e9s plus haut ils me semblent bien peu. Beaucoup d'\u00e9l\u00e8ves ne sont pas pr\u00eats, parce que le num\u00e9rique n'a servi jusqu'\u00e0 pr\u00e9sent qu'\u00e0 s'abonner \u00e0 SnapChat ou Instagram \u00e0 la maison et que le seul discours tenu par l'\u00e9cole est qu'il faut se m\u00e9fier de Wikip\u00e9dia et que sur les r\u00e9seaux sociaux, du fond du Darknet, \u00e9mergent p\u00e9donazis, djihadistes et consort. M\u00eame le CNED invite les enseignants \u00e0 \u00e9viter Wikip\u00e9dia. Pire encore, les ordinateurs dont sont \u00e9quip\u00e9s les \u00e9l\u00e8ves sont bien trop souvent laiss\u00e9s au fond des sacs. Le message est alors celui-ci : la machine est inutile. Vous avez un cahier. On a m\u00eame achet\u00e9 des manuels scolaires. Votre ordinateur ne sert qu'\u00e0 l'apporter. L'essentiel est ailleurs. Or si vous r\u00e9cup\u00e9rez des \u00e9l\u00e8ves \u00e0 qui on serine cela depuis 10 ans, si vous essayez telle pratique p\u00e9dagogique avec des \u00e9l\u00e8ves qui depuis leur plus jeune \u00e2ge sont rompus \u00e0 une p\u00e9dagogie magistrale, vous aurez (du moins en ai-je) toutes les peines du monde \u00e0 leur tenir un autre discours. Vous \u00eates en porte-\u00e0-faux. Les \u00e9l\u00e8ves sont en porte-\u00e0-faux. De ce point de vue, l'ordinateur confi\u00e9 aux \u00e9l\u00e8ves par le Conseil d\u00e9partemental est singulier. Voici comment les choses se passent : un \u00e9l\u00e8ve qui a pass\u00e9 7 ans au moins de sa scolarit\u00e9 dans les cahiers, le papier et les stylos re\u00e7oit un beau jour d'octobre (et non pas septembre) un ordinateur. Rien ne l'a pr\u00e9par\u00e9 \u00e0 cela. Par exemple, l'\u00e9l\u00e8ve ne sait pas taper au clavier et il \u00e9prouvera quelques difficult\u00e9s \u00e0 noter le texte dict\u00e9. Cette difficult\u00e9 sera d'autant plus \u00e9vidente que l'ordinateur sera peu utilis\u00e9 dans la plupart des mati\u00e8res. Mais cette irruption de l'ordinateur dans la vie de l'\u00e9l\u00e8ve ne fait que refl\u00e9ter l'\u00e9trange caract\u00e8re hybride du monde qui est le n\u00f4tre. Je le vois bien avec la plus jeune de mes filles qui interroge nos pratiques de lecture respectives. Elle constate que je ne lis que sur \u00e9cran et vois bien qu'elle ne lit que sur papier, que tout son monde (ou presque) n'est que papier. Sa scolarit\u00e9 tiendra dans du papier. Elle est n\u00e9e en 2009 et passera probablement son bac en rendant une feuille de papier. Peut-\u00eatre un jour un Conseil d\u00e9partemental entreprendra de lui coller un ordinateur dans le sac, un ordinateur dont la plupart des enseignants ne serviront pas et dont elle ne saura pas quoi faire. C'est m\u00eame le pire que je puisse lui souhaiter, car au moins la machine pay\u00e9e par nos imp\u00f4ts ne servira pas \u00e0 \u00e9changer films pornographiques et jeux vid\u00e9o (c'est tr\u00e8s bien les jeux vid\u00e9o, mais je n'ai encore trouv\u00e9 aucune utilit\u00e9 p\u00e9dagogique \u00e0 Call of duty). D'une certaine fa\u00e7on, depuis l'av\u00e8nement du World Wide Web dans les ann\u00e9es 90, il n'est pas dit que les choses aient grandement chang\u00e9 dans les \u00e9coles ou dans la perception que les enseignants ont de l'\u00e9cole. De fait, les \u00e9l\u00e8ves non plus. In fine, tout se passe comme si les enseignants les plus r\u00e9fractaires au num\u00e9rique avaient trouv\u00e9 malgr\u00e9 eux la r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 toutes les injonctions \u00e0 faire entrer le num\u00e9rique dans leur pratique. Il suffisait de ne pas le faire. Les \u00e9l\u00e8ves se chargeraient de montrer que c'est normal.

La d\u00e9faite de Garry Kasparov face \u00e0 Deep Blue http://web-tech.fr/deep-blue-bug-kasparov-17102012/ Advanced Chess \u29eb Le d\u00e9but du livre de Clive Thompson, Smarter than you think , nous raconte une histoire extraordinaire. Celle-ci commence avec le champion d\u2019\u00e9checs Garry Kasparov et sa d\u00e9faite contre Deep Blue, un ordinateur con\u00e7u par IBM, en 1996. Cette d\u00e9faite consacrait-elle le succ\u00e8s de l\u2019intelligence artificielle ? Fallait-il abdiquer toute pr\u00e9tention \u00e0 jouer \u00e0 un jeu auquel les machines excellaient ? Des machines capables de calculer 200 millions de coups par seconde ? Garry Kasparov eut une id\u00e9e. Il se dit que plut\u00f4t de lutter contre la machine, il fallait jouer avec la machine. L\u2019homme et l\u2019ordinateur devaient collaborer . L\u2019un et l\u2019autre b\u00e9n\u00e9ficieraient de leurs qualit\u00e9s respectives. L\u2019ordinateur apporterait sa puissance de calcul et donc sa capacit\u00e9 \u00e0 traiter en un instant des millions de possibilit\u00e9s, ses bases de donn\u00e9es contenant l\u2019historique et le d\u00e9tail de milliers de parties, tandis que l\u2019homme apporterait sa cr\u00e9ativit\u00e9, sa capacit\u00e9 \u00e0 percer l\u2019adversaire et \u00e0 le d\u00e9stabiliser en jouant un coup inattendu par son intuition et sa perspicacit\u00e9. C\u2019est ce qu\u2019on a baptis\u00e9 Advanced Chess , une technique de jeu qui permettrait d\u2019\u00e9viter de perdre \u00e0 cause d\u2019une erreur de calcul. Ainsi allaient s\u2019affronter deux \u00e9quipes : un homme et un ordinateur contre un autre homme \u00e9quip\u00e9 lui aussi d\u2019un ordinateur. \u00c0 ce jeu, Kasparov affronta un autre grand joueur, Veselin Topalov. Ce dernier \u00e9tait moins fort que son adversaire, mais il gagna, ayant mieux exploit\u00e9 les ressources offertes par l\u2019ordinateur. Cette technique de jeu assist\u00e9 par ordinateur a donn\u00e9 naissance au Freestyle Chess, une variante de l\u2019Advanced Chess. Le joueur, appel\u00e9 Centaure, peut \u00eatre assist\u00e9 d\u2019autres joueurs ainsi que de divers programmes d\u2019\u00e9checs. Le centaure est ici un \u00eatre hybride qui parie sur l\u2019int\u00e9gration de l\u2019homme et de la machine. La v\u00e9ritable force du centaure est d\u2019\u00eatre capable de combiner les capacit\u00e9s strat\u00e9giques purement humaines \u00e0 la puissance de calcul de l\u2019ordinateur (la \u00ab brute force \u00bb) . En 2005, un fait int\u00e9ressant durant ces parties de Freestyle est \u00e0 prendre en consid\u00e9ration : des amateurs ont \u00e9t\u00e9 confront\u00e9s \u00e0 des professionnels, et ces amateurs ont r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 battre des joueurs professionnels parce qu\u2019ils \u00e9taient plus prompts \u00e0 collaborer, \u00e0 travailler ensemble par \u00e9quipe tout en s\u2019aidant d\u2019ordinateurs. Ils collaboraient avec les machines, sachant quand se fier \u00e0 leurs conseils et quand privil\u00e9gier des combinaisons jug\u00e9es peu fiables par la machine mais susceptibles de d\u00e9contenancer l\u2019adversaire. Mieux encore, ce sont des amateurs qui ont battu Hydra, un ordinateur beaucoup plus puissant que Deep Blue (un cluster de plusieurs machines disposant de 16 processeurs Intel Xeon cadenc\u00e9 \u00e0 3,06 GHz et poss\u00e9dant 32 Go de m\u00e9moire vive). Intelligence humaine et intelligence artificielle \u29eb Clive Thompson en arrive \u00e0 cette question : qui est le plus intelligent ? L\u2019\u00eatre humain ? La machine ? En fait, il ne sert \u00e0 rien de les opposer. Ils travaillent ensemble. Cette id\u00e9e du mariage entre intelligence humaine et l\u2019intelligence artificielle, on la retrouve d\u00e9velopp\u00e9e par Emmanuel Davidenkoff . Selon le journaliste, l\u2019intelligence artificielle va changer la fa\u00e7on d\u2019exercer de nombreux m\u00e9tiers auxquels on acc\u00e8de aujourd\u2019hui avec un bac + 5 voire plus. Dans certains m\u00e9tiers, 80% de ce que font des hommes peut \u00eatre r\u00e9alis\u00e9 par une machine pour un co\u00fbt moindre . Dans ces 80 %, il y a le par c\u0153ur, l\u2019empilement de connaissances, l\u2019automatisation, toutes sortes de comp\u00e9tences pour lesquelles l\u2019ordinateur bat l\u2019homme \u00e0 plate couture. Les 20% restant vont prendre une nouvelle importance. Ce sont les qualit\u00e9s humaines que la machine est incapable de dupliquer comme l\u2019empathie ou la capacit\u00e9 \u00e0 prendre un risque. Dans le contexte des langues vivantes, l\u2019individu peut se pr\u00e9valoir de la compr\u00e9hension d\u2019une culture, d\u2019une nuance qui \u00e9chappera \u00e0 la machine. Par quelque bout que l\u2019on prenne les choses, l\u2019\u00eatre humain et la machine doivent collaborer. Il faut se faire \u00e0 l\u2019id\u00e9e qu\u2019une intelligence artificielle puisse devenir l\u2019une de vos coll\u00e8gues, comme dans ce cabinet d\u2019avocats . Voil\u00e0 une coop\u00e9ration que l\u2019on souhaiterait et m\u00eame devrait observer en classe. J\u2019ai toujours regrett\u00e9 que des \u00e9l\u00e8ves aient dans leur poche des t\u00e9l\u00e9phones dont la puissance est rel\u00e9gu\u00e9e au fond de la poche. Et surtout on voit encore une fois que loin d\u2019isoler l\u2019individu dans des pratiques asociales de geeks renferm\u00e9s, travailler avec un ordinateur suppose la collaboration avec ces ordinateurs mais aussi, comme dans le Freestyle Chess, avec d\u2019autres utilisateurs . Le travail collaboratif est d\u2019ailleurs l\u2019illustration m\u00eame de ce qu\u2019est aujourd\u2019hui internet, de Wikip\u00e9dia aux r\u00e9seaux sociaux. Cette id\u00e9e de collaboration est extr\u00eamement importante. On la retrouve tout r\u00e9cemment dans les propos tenus par Demis Hassabis, le fondateur du logiciel d\u2019AlphaGo tournant sur DeepMind, l\u2019ordinateur qui a battu Lee Sedol, le champion du monde du jeu de Go, jeu qui \u00e9tait r\u00e9put\u00e9 pour \u00eatre le dernier bastion de l\u2019intelligence humaine. AlphaGo ne s\u2019est pas simplement livr\u00e9 \u00e0 des calculs en force brute afin de d\u00e9terminer des milliers de coups d\u2019avance, comme ce fut le cas avec Deep Blue d\u2019IBM face \u00e0 Kasparov, mais a pris la place d\u2019un joueur. AlphaGo ne r\u00e9p\u00e8te pas des combinaisons, il apprend. Les commentateurs \u2014 et Sedol lui-m\u00eame \u2014 ont \u00e9t\u00e9 surpris par l\u2019attitude de l\u2019intelligence artificielle qui a fait preuve d\u2019ing\u00e9niosit\u00e9 et d\u2019originalit\u00e9. Mais ce qui est \u00e9tonnant, c\u2019est que Sedol ait \u00e9t\u00e9 capable de rivaliser contre un ordinateur capable de calculer des dizaines de milliers de positions par seconde et m\u00eame repousser AlphaGo dans ses retranchements. Google DeepMinde http://www.theverge.com/2016/3/10/11192774/demis-hassabis-interview-alphago-google-deepmind-ai Certes, sur les cinq manches que comptait le tournoi, AlphaGo en a remport\u00e9 4. Le champion a tenu 5 heures lors de la troisi\u00e8me manche et tenu en \u00e9chec la machine. Ce qui signifie que le joueur a observ\u00e9 le comportement de la machine et a \u00e9t\u00e9 capable de s\u2019adapter autant que faire se pouvait. Et si l\u2019on se demande \u00e0 quoi cette intelligence artificielle peut bien servir sinon d\u00e9primer des champions du monde, le fondateur d\u2019AlphaGo nous donne la r\u00e9ponse : \u00ab What I\u2019m really excited to use this kind of AI for is science, and advancing that faster. I\u2019d like to see AI-assisted science where you have effectively AI research assistants that do a lot of the drudgery work and surface interesting articles, find structure in vast amounts of data, and then surface that to the human experts and scientists who can make quicker breakthroughs . I was giving a talk at CERN a few months ago ; obviously they create more data than pretty much anyone on the planet, and for all we know there could be new particles sitting on their massive hard drives somewhere and no-one\u2019s got around to analyzing that because there\u2019s just so much data. So I think it\u2019d be cool if one day an AI was involved in finding a new particle. \u00bb Il s\u2019agit donc encore de collaboration et pas uniquement d\u2019affrontement entre l\u2019homme et la machine. Tous deux doivent collaborer. Et je crois qu\u2019il est vraiment important que les \u00e9l\u00e8ves apprennent \u00e0 travailler avec des machines et \u00e0 retrouver et trier et utiliser des masses de donn\u00e9es. Comment Le Monde a travaill\u00e9 sur plus de 11 millions de fichiers http://www.lemonde.fr/panama-papers/article/2016/04/03/panama-papers-comment-le-monde-a-travaille-sur-plus-de-11-millions-de-fichiers_4894836_4890278.html Ce qui s\u2019est pass\u00e9 avec les Panama Papers est un exemple suppl\u00e9mentaire du travail collaboratif qui sera de fa\u00e7on irr\u00e9fragable le lot de nos \u00e9l\u00e8ves devenus adultes. Les Panama Papers sont la fuite de donn\u00e9es la plus importante de l\u2019histoire du journalisme qui repr\u00e9sente 11,5 millions de documents, soit 2,6 t\u00e9raoctets (2600 Go) de donn\u00e9es secr\u00e8tes d\u00e9couvertes, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire 1500 fois Wikileaks. Comment traite-t-on autant de donn\u00e9es ? Assur\u00e9ment pas seul. 376 journalistes ont travaill\u00e9 ensemble sous la houlette du ICIJ (Consortium international des journalistes d\u2019investigation). Mais des centaines de journalistes ne suffisent pas. Il leur faut des ordinateurs et notamment un moteur de recherche con\u00e7u sp\u00e9cifiquement pour explorer les bases de donn\u00e9es des journalistes. Encore fallait-il savoir s\u2019en servir et \u00eatre capable de proc\u00e9der \u00e0 des recherches avanc\u00e9es. Il fallait aussi savoir utiliser un OCR afin de parcourir des documents non encore num\u00e9ris\u00e9s. Ce ne sont que quelques exemples des outils n\u00e9cessaires \u00e0 la r\u00e9alisation du travail journalistique .

Celle-ci commence avec le champion d\u2019\u00e9checs Garry Kasparov et sa d\u00e9faite contre Deep Blue, un ordinateur con\u00e7u par IBM, en 1996. Cette d\u00e9faite consacrait-elle le succ\u00e8s de l\u2019intelligence artificielle ? Fallait-il abdiquer toute pr\u00e9tention \u00e0 jouer \u00e0 un jeu auquel les machines excellaient ? Des machines capables de calculer 200 millions de coups par seconde ? Garry Kasparov eut une id\u00e9e. Il se dit que plut\u00f4t de lutter contre la machine, il fallait jouer avec la machine. L\u2019homme et l\u2019ordinateur devaient collaborer . L\u2019un et l\u2019autre b\u00e9n\u00e9ficieraient de leurs qualit\u00e9s respectives. L\u2019ordinateur apporterait sa puissance de calcul et donc sa capacit\u00e9 \u00e0 traiter en un instant des millions de possibilit\u00e9s, ses bases de donn\u00e9es contenant l\u2019historique et le d\u00e9tail de milliers de parties, tandis que l\u2019homme apporterait sa cr\u00e9ativit\u00e9, sa capacit\u00e9 \u00e0 percer l\u2019adversaire et \u00e0 le d\u00e9stabiliser en jouant un coup inattendu par son intuition et sa perspicacit\u00e9. C\u2019est ce qu\u2019on a baptis\u00e9 Advanced Chess , une technique de jeu qui permettrait d\u2019\u00e9viter de perdre \u00e0 cause d\u2019une erreur de calcul. Ainsi allaient s\u2019affronter deux \u00e9quipes : un homme et un ordinateur contre un autre homme \u00e9quip\u00e9 lui aussi d\u2019un ordinateur. \u00c0 ce jeu, Kasparov affronta un autre grand joueur, Veselin Topalov. Ce dernier \u00e9tait moins fort que son adversaire, mais il gagna, ayant mieux exploit\u00e9 les ressources offertes par l\u2019ordinateur. Cette technique de jeu assist\u00e9 par ordinateur a donn\u00e9 naissance au Freestyle Chess, une variante de l\u2019Advanced Chess. Le joueur, appel\u00e9 Centaure, peut \u00eatre assist\u00e9 d\u2019autres joueurs ainsi que de divers programmes d\u2019\u00e9checs. Le centaure est ici un \u00eatre hybride qui parie sur l\u2019int\u00e9gration de l\u2019homme et de la machine. La v\u00e9ritable force du centaure est d\u2019\u00eatre capable de combiner les capacit\u00e9s strat\u00e9giques purement humaines \u00e0 la puissance de calcul de l\u2019ordinateur (la \u00ab brute force \u00bb) . En 2005, un fait int\u00e9ressant durant ces parties de Freestyle est \u00e0 prendre en consid\u00e9ration : des amateurs ont \u00e9t\u00e9 confront\u00e9s \u00e0 des professionnels, et ces amateurs ont r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 battre des joueurs professionnels parce qu\u2019ils \u00e9taient plus prompts \u00e0 collaborer, \u00e0 travailler ensemble par \u00e9quipe tout en s\u2019aidant d\u2019ordinateurs. Ils collaboraient avec les machines, sachant quand se fier \u00e0 leurs conseils et quand privil\u00e9gier des combinaisons jug\u00e9es peu fiables par la machine mais susceptibles de d\u00e9contenancer l\u2019adversaire. Mieux encore, ce sont des amateurs qui ont battu Hydra, un ordinateur beaucoup plus puissant que Deep Blue (un cluster de plusieurs machines disposant de 16 processeurs Intel Xeon cadenc\u00e9 \u00e0 3,06 GHz et poss\u00e9dant 32 Go de m\u00e9moire vive).","title":"Advanced Chess"},{"location":"%C3%89criture/Medium/Qu%E2%80%99est-ce%20qu%E2%80%99un%20Centaure%20%3F/#intelligence-humaine-et-intelligence-artificielle","text":"Clive Thompson en arrive \u00e0 cette question : qui est le plus intelligent ? L\u2019\u00eatre humain ? La machine ? En fait, il ne sert \u00e0 rien de les opposer. Ils travaillent ensemble. Cette id\u00e9e du mariage entre intelligence humaine et l\u2019intelligence artificielle, on la retrouve d\u00e9velopp\u00e9e par Emmanuel Davidenkoff . Selon le journaliste, l\u2019intelligence artificielle va changer la fa\u00e7on d\u2019exercer de nombreux m\u00e9tiers auxquels on acc\u00e8de aujourd\u2019hui avec un bac + 5 voire plus. Dans certains m\u00e9tiers, 80% de ce que font des hommes peut \u00eatre r\u00e9alis\u00e9 par une machine pour un co\u00fbt moindre . Dans ces 80 %, il y a le par c\u0153ur, l\u2019empilement de connaissances, l\u2019automatisation, toutes sortes de comp\u00e9tences pour lesquelles l\u2019ordinateur bat l\u2019homme \u00e0 plate couture. Les 20% restant vont prendre une nouvelle importance. Ce sont les qualit\u00e9s humaines que la machine est incapable de dupliquer comme l\u2019empathie ou la capacit\u00e9 \u00e0 prendre un risque. Dans le contexte des langues vivantes, l\u2019individu peut se pr\u00e9valoir de la compr\u00e9hension d\u2019une culture, d\u2019une nuance qui \u00e9chappera \u00e0 la machine. Par quelque bout que l\u2019on prenne les choses, l\u2019\u00eatre humain et la machine doivent collaborer. Il faut se faire \u00e0 l\u2019id\u00e9e qu\u2019une intelligence artificielle puisse devenir l\u2019une de vos coll\u00e8gues, comme dans ce cabinet d\u2019avocats . Voil\u00e0 une coop\u00e9ration que l\u2019on souhaiterait et m\u00eame devrait observer en classe. J\u2019ai toujours regrett\u00e9 que des \u00e9l\u00e8ves aient dans leur poche des t\u00e9l\u00e9phones dont la puissance est rel\u00e9gu\u00e9e au fond de la poche. Et surtout on voit encore une fois que loin d\u2019isoler l\u2019individu dans des pratiques asociales de geeks renferm\u00e9s, travailler avec un ordinateur suppose la collaboration avec ces ordinateurs mais aussi, comme dans le Freestyle Chess, avec d\u2019autres utilisateurs . Le travail collaboratif est d\u2019ailleurs l\u2019illustration m\u00eame de ce qu\u2019est aujourd\u2019hui internet, de Wikip\u00e9dia aux r\u00e9seaux sociaux. Cette id\u00e9e de collaboration est extr\u00eamement importante. On la retrouve tout r\u00e9cemment dans les propos tenus par Demis Hassabis, le fondateur du logiciel d\u2019AlphaGo tournant sur DeepMind, l\u2019ordinateur qui a battu Lee Sedol, le champion du monde du jeu de Go, jeu qui \u00e9tait r\u00e9put\u00e9 pour \u00eatre le dernier bastion de l\u2019intelligence humaine. AlphaGo ne s\u2019est pas simplement livr\u00e9 \u00e0 des calculs en force brute afin de d\u00e9terminer des milliers de coups d\u2019avance, comme ce fut le cas avec Deep Blue d\u2019IBM face \u00e0 Kasparov, mais a pris la place d\u2019un joueur. AlphaGo ne r\u00e9p\u00e8te pas des combinaisons, il apprend. Les commentateurs \u2014 et Sedol lui-m\u00eame \u2014 ont \u00e9t\u00e9 surpris par l\u2019attitude de l\u2019intelligence artificielle qui a fait preuve d\u2019ing\u00e9niosit\u00e9 et d\u2019originalit\u00e9. Mais ce qui est \u00e9tonnant, c\u2019est que Sedol ait \u00e9t\u00e9 capable de rivaliser contre un ordinateur capable de calculer des dizaines de milliers de positions par seconde et m\u00eame repousser AlphaGo dans ses retranchements. Google DeepMinde http://www.theverge.com/2016/3/10/11192774/demis-hassabis-interview-alphago-google-deepmind-ai Certes, sur les cinq manches que comptait le tournoi, AlphaGo en a remport\u00e9 4. Le champion a tenu 5 heures lors de la troisi\u00e8me manche et tenu en \u00e9chec la machine. Ce qui signifie que le joueur a observ\u00e9 le comportement de la machine et a \u00e9t\u00e9 capable de s\u2019adapter autant que faire se pouvait. Et si l\u2019on se demande \u00e0 quoi cette intelligence artificielle peut bien servir sinon d\u00e9primer des champions du monde, le fondateur d\u2019AlphaGo nous donne la r\u00e9ponse : \u00ab What I\u2019m really excited to use this kind of AI for is science, and advancing that faster. I\u2019d like to see AI-assisted science where you have effectively AI research assistants that do a lot of the drudgery work and surface interesting articles, find structure in vast amounts of data, and then surface that to the human experts and scientists who can make quicker breakthroughs . I was giving a talk at CERN a few months ago ; obviously they create more data than pretty much anyone on the planet, and for all we know there could be new particles sitting on their massive hard drives somewhere and no-one\u2019s got around to analyzing that because there\u2019s just so much data. So I think it\u2019d be cool if one day an AI was involved in finding a new particle. \u00bb Il s\u2019agit donc encore de collaboration et pas uniquement d\u2019affrontement entre l\u2019homme et la machine. Tous deux doivent collaborer. Et je crois qu\u2019il est vraiment important que les \u00e9l\u00e8ves apprennent \u00e0 travailler avec des machines et \u00e0 retrouver et trier et utiliser des masses de donn\u00e9es.

Les Panama Papers sont la fuite de donn\u00e9es la plus importante de l\u2019histoire du journalisme qui repr\u00e9sente 11,5 millions de documents, soit 2,6 t\u00e9raoctets (2600 Go) de donn\u00e9es secr\u00e8tes d\u00e9couvertes, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire 1500 fois Wikileaks. Comment traite-t-on autant de donn\u00e9es ? Assur\u00e9ment pas seul. 376 journalistes ont travaill\u00e9 ensemble sous la houlette du ICIJ (Consortium international des journalistes d\u2019investigation). Mais des centaines de journalistes ne suffisent pas. Il leur faut des ordinateurs et notamment un moteur de recherche con\u00e7u sp\u00e9cifiquement pour explorer les bases de donn\u00e9es des journalistes. Encore fallait-il savoir s\u2019en servir et \u00eatre capable de proc\u00e9der \u00e0 des recherches avanc\u00e9es. Il fallait aussi savoir utiliser un OCR afin de parcourir des documents non encore num\u00e9ris\u00e9s. Ce ne sont que quelques exemples des outils n\u00e9cessaires \u00e0 la r\u00e9alisation du travail journalistique .

S\u2019est-elle consid\u00e9rablement transform\u00e9e \u00e0 travers les si\u00e8cles ou est-elle demeur\u00e9e inchang\u00e9e ? N\u2019est-elle pas un peu comme ce bon vieux livre, cet ensemble de feuilles reli\u00e9es, qui selon Umberto Eco constitue une perfection ind\u00e9passable, comme le sont la roue ou la cuill\u00e8re ? Un enseignant face \u00e0 des \u00e9l\u00e8ves dans une salle, n\u2019est-ce pas ainsi que l\u2019enseignement doit se pratiquer ? Une \u00e9cole dans laquelle on r\u00e9unit des \u00e9l\u00e8ves ayant \u00e0 peu pr\u00e8s le m\u00eame \u00e2ge, ayant plus ou moins le m\u00eame niveau et faisant la m\u00eame chose en m\u00eame temps, est-ce le mod\u00e8le qui peut perdurer ind\u00e9finiment dans le temps ? Comparer l\u2019\u00e9tat de la m\u00e9decine avec celui de l\u2019enseignement peut \u00eatre assez amusant (m\u00eame si de prime abord, on ne voit pas bien quel pourrait \u00eatre le rapport) et surtout nous permettre de r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 cette question. On peut se dire avec Fran\u00e7ois Taddei que \u00ab Si Pasteur revenait et voyait la m\u00e9decine aujourd\u2019hui, il verrait davantage de diff\u00e9rences que si Jules Ferry rentrait dans une \u00e9cole \u00bb. Le rapprochement n\u2019est pas nouveau. En prenant appui sur le tableau de Laurentius de Voltolina, on a une petite id\u00e9e de la mani\u00e8re dont on faisait cours il y a plus de 600 ans. Mani\u00e8re qui est \u00e0 peu pr\u00e8s celle que l\u2019on peut observer dans bon nombre de salles de classe aujourd\u2019hui : un professeur fait cours \u00e0 une vingtaine d\u2019\u00e9l\u00e8ves assis en rang et dont une partie discute voire dort (ou peut-\u00eatre m\u00eame pleure). Si bien qu\u2019il est tentant d\u2019ironiser et de faire ce parall\u00e8le entre m\u00e9decine et enseignement. Et, de fait, un m\u00e9decin du XIVe si\u00e8cle voyageant dans le temps et qui arriverait dans notre si\u00e8cle serait perdu. Les mots st\u00e9thoscope , scanner , IRM, transfusion sanguine lui seraient inconnus et un h\u00f4pital serait un lieu incompr\u00e9hensible pour lui. En revanche, un enseignant ayant fait le m\u00eame voyage temporel n\u2019aurait qu\u2019\u00e0 se mettre devant ses \u00e9l\u00e8ves et prendre une craie. De 1350 \u00e0 aujourd\u2019hui, il n\u2019y aurait pas un gouffre insurmontable, si l\u2019on excepte une notable \u00e9volution linguistique\u2026 La plupart des salles de classe n\u2019ont pas beaucoup chang\u00e9 avec les ann\u00e9es. Un tableau, un bureau, des rang\u00e9es de tables\u2026 ![[voltolina.jpeg]] La Loi pour la refondation de l\u2019\u00e9cole enjoint pourtant les enseignants \u00e0 op\u00e9rer certaines transformations, des transformations qui, d\u2019ailleurs, n\u2019ont pas attendu l\u2019injonction l\u00e9gislative pour \u00eatre mises en \u0153uvre. Simplement, la loi invite le corps enseignant dans son ensemble \u00e0 faire entrer le num\u00e9rique dans leurs pratiques. Le mot \u00ab num\u00e9rique \u00bb appara\u00eet, dans le texte de loi, 57 fois (\u00e0 titre de comparaison, le mot \u00ab \u00e9cole \u00bb compte 216 occurrences). C\u2019est dire l\u2019importance de la chose. Cependant le mot recouvre une notion tellement vaste qu\u2019il signifie tout et son contraire, le meilleur comme le pire. Car il faut admettre qu\u2019on nous rebat _ad nauseam_les oreilles avec le num\u00e9rique, et je ne suis pas toujours certain que cela soit \u00e0 bon escient. Pendant un temps \u2014 celui des pionniers, dit-on souvent \u2014 le num\u00e9rique ne me semblait pouvoir qu\u2019\u00eatre uniquement b\u00e9n\u00e9fique. Et les ann\u00e9es passant, je me suis souvent dit que bien des fois, le num\u00e9rique n\u2019apportait rien ou pas ce qu\u2019il aurait fallu qu\u2019il apporte. Or j\u2019ai r\u00e9cemment lu deux livres qui m\u2019ont litt\u00e9ralement boulevers\u00e9 et qui m\u2019ont, il me semble, aid\u00e9 \u00e0 mieux d\u00e9finir ce que le num\u00e9rique pouvait ou devait \u00eatre. Le premier est Smarter than you think de Clive Thompson qui montre comment la technologie nous rend plus intelligent ; le second est un livre d\u00e9j\u00e0 un peu moins r\u00e9cent, qui est L\u2019\u00c9l\u00e9ment de Ken Robinson, et qui montre combien l\u2019\u00e9cole \u00e9touffe sinon tue la cr\u00e9ativit\u00e9 des enfants. Formul\u00e9 ainsi, j\u2019ai bien conscience que le propos peut para\u00eetre excessivement simpliste, si ce n\u2019est carr\u00e9ment risible. Aussi le livre que vous lisez en ce moment est-il n\u00e9 du d\u00e9sir d\u2019illustrer ce double propos, de montrer comment le num\u00e9rique peut changer l\u2019\u00e9cole ou du moins accompagner l\u2019\u00e9cole dans des changements qu\u2019il est absolument impossible d\u2019\u00e9viter et cela au b\u00e9n\u00e9fice d\u2019\u00e9l\u00e8ves souvent somm\u00e9s de s\u2019asseoir, de se taire et \u00e9ventuellement d\u2019\u00e9couter (ou pas mais en silence). J\u2019avais aussi, \u00e0 l\u2019heure o\u00f9 le mot num\u00e9rique est omnipr\u00e9sent, un besoin d\u2019apporter la caution d\u2019une r\u00e9flexion. Bien s\u00fbr, je n\u2019ai pas d\u2019autre ambition que d\u2019apporter ma modeste pierre \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9difice, en l\u2019occurrence l\u2019objet de ma r\u00e9flexion ( my two cents , comme disent les Am\u00e9ricains). J\u2019ai voulu tenter de l\u00e9gitimer l\u2019introduction du num\u00e9rique en classe. S\u2019il est souvent admis que le num\u00e9rique doit rentrer \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9cole, il faut bien voir que nombre d\u2019enseignants \u2014 et parmi eux de tr\u00e8s jeunes (ce ne sont donc pas les plus vieux qui sont r\u00e9fractaires \u00e0 des nouveaut\u00e9s qui n\u2019en sont plus) \u2014 s\u2019opposent cat\u00e9goriquement \u00e0 ce qu\u2019une machine interf\u00e8re dans leurs pratiques. Je me souviens de la premi\u00e8re formation que j\u2019ai effectu\u00e9e dans un coll\u00e8ge pr\u00e8s d\u2019Orl\u00e9ans. Tout \u00e0 ma joie de commencer ma premi\u00e8re formation, j\u2019arrive un peu en avance. Je me pr\u00e9pare, fais mes branchements dans ce coll\u00e8ge tout neuf dont tous les \u00e9l\u00e8ves et tous les enseignants ont \u00e9t\u00e9 fra\u00eechement \u00e9quip\u00e9s d\u2019iPad. Je m\u2019attends \u00e0 un grand moment de plaisir technophile. Un premier enseignant arrive. Il fait la t\u00eate. La raison : on lui a donn\u00e9 une tablette dont il n\u2019a que faire, il a une formation de plus\u2026 Bref il n\u2019est pas tr\u00e8s heureux d\u2019\u00eatre l\u00e0. Le num\u00e9rique semble lui apporter plus de tracas que de r\u00e9confort. Plus r\u00e9cemment, on m\u2019a dit deux fois \u00e0 quelques jours d\u2019intervalles : \u00ab Je ne vois pas ce que le num\u00e9rique peut apporter \u00e0 ma mati\u00e8re \u00bb. Or j\u2019ai une foi quasi in\u00e9branlable dans le num\u00e9rique. Ce qu\u2019il m\u2019a apport\u00e9 en tant qu\u2019enseignant est inestimable. Il a transform\u00e9 ma p\u00e9dagogie, m\u2019a amen\u00e9 \u00e0 produire des choses dont je ne me serais jamais cru capable. Il m\u2019a transport\u00e9 en des lieux \u2014 de Londres \u00e0 San Francisco en passant par Gen\u00e8ve \u2014 dans lesquels je n\u2019aurais jamais esp\u00e9r\u00e9 ni m\u00eame envisag\u00e9 \u00eatre invit\u00e9. Et m\u00eame dans les moments les plus futiles, par exemple en \u00e9crivant un tweet, j\u2019ai pu voir combien le num\u00e9rique nourrissait la r\u00e9flexion. Ainsi la pens\u00e9e naissait dans un simple gazouillis (ces quelque 140 caract\u00e8res parfois si d\u00e9consid\u00e9r\u00e9s), se transformait en un article de blog, lequel s\u2019enrichissait de commentaires. La r\u00e9flexion parvenue \u00e0 sa maturit\u00e9 (on l\u2019esp\u00e8re), celle-ci venait s\u2019\u00e9panouir dans un livre (on l\u2019esp\u00e8re aussi). Or ce b\u00e9n\u00e9fice que je tire du num\u00e9rique, je suis non seulement convaincu qu\u2019il peut \u00eatre profitable \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9l\u00e8ve mais qu\u2019il est urgent qu\u2019il le soit ! Voici donc ce dont il sera question dans ce livre. On verra comment l\u2019\u00e9l\u00e8ve aid\u00e9 de son ordinateur (ou d\u2019une tablette ou d\u2019un smartphone) en vient \u00e0 mieux travailler. On en profitera pour battre en br\u00e8che cette id\u00e9e du penseur isol\u00e9 \u00e0 la Rodin, seul en son esprit d\u2019o\u00f9 il d\u00e9gagera des merveilles. L\u2019\u00e9l\u00e8ve tel qu\u2019on se le repr\u00e9sente commun\u00e9ment, tel un petit penseur pench\u00e9 sur son cahier \u00e0 grands carreaux, est un mythe qui n\u2019a pas lieu d\u2019\u00eatre et il faut le dire et le redire \u00e0 tous ceux qui s\u2019inqui\u00e8tent de l\u2019omnipr\u00e9sence de ces machines que nous portons sur nous. Ce que d\u2019aucuns qualifient de proth\u00e8ses n\u2019a rien d\u2019anxiog\u00e8ne. Elles n\u2019ont rien de nouveau. En effet, l\u2019homme consigne ses pens\u00e9es et ce dont il a besoin sur des supports externes depuis des milliers d\u2019ann\u00e9es. Cela s\u2019appelle l\u2019\u00e9criture, cela s\u2019appelle les livres. Pour l\u2019\u00e9l\u00e8ve, cela s\u2019appelle un cartable. On doit donc percevoir comment l\u2019\u00e9l\u00e8ve (mais aussi son enseignant) devient un individu augment\u00e9 (c\u2019est mieux que le proth\u00e9tique ) par le num\u00e9rique. C\u2019est en somme une cr\u00e9ature hybride assist\u00e9e d\u2019un ordinateur et que les joueurs d\u2019\u00e9checs ont appel\u00e9 des centaures. Et de savoir ce qu\u2019est un centaure \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9cole. Cette notion d\u2019hybridit\u00e9, ne la retrouve-t-on pas dans notre quotidien. Par exemple dans notre \u00e9criture, m\u00ealant lettres \u00ab en attach\u00e9 \u00bb et caract\u00e8res d\u2019imprimerie ? Cet entrelacs de signes disparates ne r\u00e9v\u00e8le-t-il pas sans que l\u2019on n\u2019y ait pr\u00eat\u00e9 attention cette mutation qui a commenc\u00e9 bien avant que nos \u00e9l\u00e8ves, pour reprendre l\u2019expression de Michel Serre, ne se transforment en petit(e) pouce(tte) ? Une fois cela dit, une fois \u00e9tabli ce substrat qu\u2019est cette modeste r\u00e9flexion, l\u2019on pourra montrer ce que doit \u00eatre le num\u00e9rique \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9cole. Il s\u2019agit en somme de se demander assez beno\u00eetement ce qu\u2019il apporte (et inversement ce qu\u2019il n\u2019apporte pas). Et j\u2019esp\u00e8re bien, au passage, fragiliser un peu cette m\u00e9fiance dont je parlais plus haut. Parfois, je parlerai de ce que font les \u00e9l\u00e8ves, de ce qu\u2019ils devraient faire et parfois j\u2019\u00e9voquerai mes propres pratiques d\u2019adulte, \u00e9tant bien entendu qu\u2019elles me sont personnelles (ne serait-ce qu\u2019en raison de mon \u00e2ge) mais qu\u2019\u00e0 un moment ou un autre, elles pourraient et devraient m\u00eame \u00eatre inculqu\u00e9es aux plus jeunes. Car c\u2019est bien d\u2019\u00e9ducation qu\u2019il s\u2019agit. L\u2019enseignant entend bien conduire (dans \u00ab \u00e9ducation \u00bb, il y a \u00ab ducere \u00bb = conduire) ses \u00e9l\u00e8ves quelque part (c\u2019est tout le sens de \u00ab \u00e9- \u00bb qui vient de \u00ab ex- \u00bb, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire \u00ab hors de \u00bb mais o\u00f9 ?). N\u2019y a-t-il pas tout un pan du num\u00e9rique qui \u00e9chappe \u00e0 nos \u00e9l\u00e8ves, car l\u2019\u00e9cole n\u2019a pas pris soin de l\u2019enseigner ? Ce livre peut aussi \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme une d\u00e9fense et illustration du num\u00e9rique ou du moins d\u2019 un certain num\u00e9rique . De toute fa\u00e7on, me disait un jour un ami, on ne fait pas de barrage contre le Pacifique. Le num\u00e9rique \u00e9tant in\u00e9luctable, la question est de savoir comment l\u2019utiliser au mieux sans renoncer aux ambitions de l\u2019\u00e9cole. D\u00e8s lors, l\u2019on verra que tout change : l\u2019\u00e9cole, l\u2019\u00e9l\u00e8ve, le professeur.","title":"Un centaure \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9cole"},{"location":"%C3%89criture/Medium/Un%20centaure%20%C3%A0%20l%E2%80%99%C3%A9cole/#voici-lavant-propos","text":"Ne vous \u00eates-vous jamais demand\u00e9 \u00e0 quoi ressemblait l\u2019\u00e9cole il y a 100, 200, 300 ou m\u00eame 400 ans ? S\u2019est-elle consid\u00e9rablement transform\u00e9e \u00e0 travers les si\u00e8cles ou est-elle demeur\u00e9e inchang\u00e9e ? N\u2019est-elle pas un peu comme ce bon vieux livre, cet ensemble de feuilles reli\u00e9es, qui selon Umberto Eco constitue une perfection ind\u00e9passable, comme le sont la roue ou la cuill\u00e8re ? Un enseignant face \u00e0 des \u00e9l\u00e8ves dans une salle, n\u2019est-ce pas ainsi que l\u2019enseignement doit se pratiquer ? Une \u00e9cole dans laquelle on r\u00e9unit des \u00e9l\u00e8ves ayant \u00e0 peu pr\u00e8s le m\u00eame \u00e2ge, ayant plus ou moins le m\u00eame niveau et faisant la m\u00eame chose en m\u00eame temps, est-ce le mod\u00e8le qui peut perdurer ind\u00e9finiment dans le temps ? Comparer l\u2019\u00e9tat de la m\u00e9decine avec celui de l\u2019enseignement peut \u00eatre assez amusant (m\u00eame si de prime abord, on ne voit pas bien quel pourrait \u00eatre le rapport) et surtout nous permettre de r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 cette question. On peut se dire avec Fran\u00e7ois Taddei que \u00ab Si Pasteur revenait et voyait la m\u00e9decine aujourd\u2019hui, il verrait davantage de diff\u00e9rences que si Jules Ferry rentrait dans une \u00e9cole \u00bb. Le rapprochement n\u2019est pas nouveau. En prenant appui sur le tableau de Laurentius de Voltolina, on a une petite id\u00e9e de la mani\u00e8re dont on faisait cours il y a plus de 600 ans. Mani\u00e8re qui est \u00e0 peu pr\u00e8s celle que l\u2019on peut observer dans bon nombre de salles de classe aujourd\u2019hui : un professeur fait cours \u00e0 une vingtaine d\u2019\u00e9l\u00e8ves assis en rang et dont une partie discute voire dort (ou peut-\u00eatre m\u00eame pleure). Si bien qu\u2019il est tentant d\u2019ironiser et de faire ce parall\u00e8le entre m\u00e9decine et enseignement. Et, de fait, un m\u00e9decin du XIVe si\u00e8cle voyageant dans le temps et qui arriverait dans notre si\u00e8cle serait perdu. Les mots st\u00e9thoscope , scanner , IRM, transfusion sanguine lui seraient inconnus et un h\u00f4pital serait un lieu incompr\u00e9hensible pour lui. En revanche, un enseignant ayant fait le m\u00eame voyage temporel n\u2019aurait qu\u2019\u00e0 se mettre devant ses \u00e9l\u00e8ves et prendre une craie. De 1350 \u00e0 aujourd\u2019hui, il n\u2019y aurait pas un gouffre insurmontable, si l\u2019on excepte une notable \u00e9volution linguistique\u2026 La plupart des salles de classe n\u2019ont pas beaucoup chang\u00e9 avec les ann\u00e9es. Un tableau, un bureau, des rang\u00e9es de tables\u2026 ![[voltolina.jpeg]] La Loi pour la refondation de l\u2019\u00e9cole enjoint pourtant les enseignants \u00e0 op\u00e9rer certaines transformations, des transformations qui, d\u2019ailleurs, n\u2019ont pas attendu l\u2019injonction l\u00e9gislative pour \u00eatre mises en \u0153uvre. Simplement, la loi invite le corps enseignant dans son ensemble \u00e0 faire entrer le num\u00e9rique dans leurs pratiques. Le mot \u00ab num\u00e9rique \u00bb appara\u00eet, dans le texte de loi, 57 fois (\u00e0 titre de comparaison, le mot \u00ab \u00e9cole \u00bb compte 216 occurrences). C\u2019est dire l\u2019importance de la chose. Cependant le mot recouvre une notion tellement vaste qu\u2019il signifie tout et son contraire, le meilleur comme le pire. Car il faut admettre qu\u2019on nous rebat _ad nauseam_les oreilles avec le num\u00e9rique, et je ne suis pas toujours certain que cela soit \u00e0 bon escient. Pendant un temps \u2014 celui des pionniers, dit-on souvent \u2014 le num\u00e9rique ne me semblait pouvoir qu\u2019\u00eatre uniquement b\u00e9n\u00e9fique.

Et de savoir ce qu\u2019est un centaure \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9cole. Cette notion d\u2019hybridit\u00e9, ne la retrouve-t-on pas dans notre quotidien. Par exemple dans notre \u00e9criture, m\u00ealant lettres \u00ab en attach\u00e9 \u00bb et caract\u00e8res d\u2019imprimerie ? Cet entrelacs de signes disparates ne r\u00e9v\u00e8le-t-il pas sans que l\u2019on n\u2019y ait pr\u00eat\u00e9 attention cette mutation qui a commenc\u00e9 bien avant que nos \u00e9l\u00e8ves, pour reprendre l\u2019expression de Michel Serre, ne se transforment en petit(e) pouce(tte) ? Une fois cela dit, une fois \u00e9tabli ce substrat qu\u2019est cette modeste r\u00e9flexion, l\u2019on pourra montrer ce que doit \u00eatre le num\u00e9rique \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9cole. Il s\u2019agit en somme de se demander assez beno\u00eetement ce qu\u2019il apporte (et inversement ce qu\u2019il n\u2019apporte pas). Et j\u2019esp\u00e8re bien, au passage, fragiliser un peu cette m\u00e9fiance dont je parlais plus haut. Parfois, je parlerai de ce que font les \u00e9l\u00e8ves, de ce qu\u2019ils devraient faire et parfois j\u2019\u00e9voquerai mes propres pratiques d\u2019adulte, \u00e9tant bien entendu qu\u2019elles me sont personnelles (ne serait-ce qu\u2019en raison de mon \u00e2ge) mais qu\u2019\u00e0 un moment ou un autre, elles pourraient et devraient m\u00eame \u00eatre inculqu\u00e9es aux plus jeunes. Car c\u2019est bien d\u2019\u00e9ducation qu\u2019il s\u2019agit. L\u2019enseignant entend bien conduire (dans \u00ab \u00e9ducation \u00bb, il y a \u00ab ducere \u00bb = conduire) ses \u00e9l\u00e8ves quelque part (c\u2019est tout le sens de \u00ab \u00e9- \u00bb qui vient de \u00ab ex- \u00bb, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire \u00ab hors de \u00bb mais o\u00f9 ?). N\u2019y a-t-il pas tout un pan du num\u00e9rique qui \u00e9chappe \u00e0 nos \u00e9l\u00e8ves, car l\u2019\u00e9cole n\u2019a pas pris soin de l\u2019enseigner ? Ce livre peut aussi \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme une d\u00e9fense et illustration du num\u00e9rique ou du moins d\u2019 un certain num\u00e9rique . De toute fa\u00e7on, me disait un jour un ami, on ne fait pas de barrage contre le Pacifique. Le num\u00e9rique \u00e9tant in\u00e9luctable, la question est de savoir comment l\u2019utiliser au mieux sans renoncer aux ambitions de l\u2019\u00e9cole. D\u00e8s lors, l\u2019on verra que tout change : l\u2019\u00e9cole, l\u2019\u00e9l\u00e8ve, le professeur.","title":"Voici l\u2019avant-propos"},{"location":"%C3%89criture/Medium/Un%20ordinateur%20entre%20les%20mains%20d%E2%80%99un%20coll%C3%A9gien%2C%20%C3%A7a%20change%20quoi%20%3F/","text":"Lien Comme chaque ann\u00e9e dans les Landes, les coll\u00e9giens ont re\u00e7u un ordinateur \u00e0 la fin du mois de septembre.

Dans mon coll\u00e8ge, cela fait donc deux jours que nos \u00e9l\u00e8ves travaillent avec une machine et ce qui m\u2019a int\u00e9ress\u00e9, c\u2019\u00e9tait de d\u00e9terminer ce que cela change de passer du papier \u00e0 l\u2019ordinateur.

Il y a des jeux pour apprendre \u00e0 trouver les lettres le plus rapidement possible. Il y a des exercices tr\u00e8s progressifs pour apprendre \u00e0 taper au clavier en positionnant correctement les doigts, les mains, et d\u2019ailleurs tout le corps afin d\u2019\u00e9viter la fatigue musculaire. Et puis on peut d\u00e9couvrir les joies de la dactylographie en tapant des s\u00e9ries de lettres, de mots voire de dict\u00e9es. C\u2019est un apprentissage ultra n\u00e9cessaire si l\u2019on ne veut pas \u00eatre confront\u00e9 \u00e0 des \u00e9l\u00e8ves \u00e0 la tra\u00eene, tapant avec deux doigts et se fatiguant la nuque et les yeux \u00e0 chercher tel ou tel caract\u00e8re.

J\u2019ai eu mon succ\u00e8s habituel en pr\u00e9sentant crtl + f , ce moment magique de celui qui cherche une info dans 300 pages. On a d\u00e9couvert des raccourcis plus complexes en rappelant qu\u2019il est possible d\u2019en retrouver un certain nombre en jetant un \u0153il dans les menus des applications utilis\u00e9es. Quelques applications \u29eb La premi\u00e8re application utilis\u00e9e est souvent le traitement de texte. Nous n\u2019avons pas eu le temps de faire grand-chose avec, mais nous avons \u00e9t\u00e9 heurt\u00e9s \u00e0 quelques petits \u00e9cueils. Comme l\u2019enregistrement n\u2019est pas automatique, il faut enregistrer son document et le faire r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement. (et rappeler qu\u2019il faut le faire) Un simple r\u00e9gulier crtl + s fait l\u2019affaire. Nous n\u2019avons pas encore abord\u00e9 la question des styles, mais nous y viendrons. On a juste eu le temps de pr\u00e9ciser que les polices fantaisistes et les couleurs turquoises ou fuschia \u00e9taient \u00e0 proscrire . On a \u00e9galement \u00e9voqu\u00e9 la taille de la police et la possibilit\u00e9 de zoomer dans le document si l\u2019on n\u2019y voyait pas suffisamment. En les observant noter la le\u00e7on, j\u2019ai pu remarqu\u00e9 qu\u2019ils \u00e9taient emb\u00eat\u00e9s\u2026 avec les couleurs ( Pourquoi \u00e7a \u00e9crit en rouge alors que je voulais du noir ? ). Mais c\u2019est quand on en est arriv\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019insertion d\u2019un tableau que je me suis aper\u00e7u que personne ne savait comment faire. \ud83e\udd14 Du moins, il avaient trouv\u00e9 l\u2019ic\u00f4ne permettant d\u2019ins\u00e9rer un tableau, mais de l\u00e0 \u00e0 reproduire le petit tableau que j\u2019avais fait, moi, avec trois de ses colonnes fusionn\u00e9es\u2026 c\u2019\u00e9tait autre chose. Un tableau Le traitement de texte est d\u2019un usage primordial. C\u2019est par le biais de ce logiciel qu\u2019ils me rendront des travaux. Ils ont donc besoin de savoir l\u2019utiliser pleinement. \u00c0 un \u00e9l\u00e8ve qui produisait un contenu compl\u00e8tement d\u00e9structur\u00e9 et qui me disait \u00ab L\u2019important, c\u2019est que je me comprenne, moi \u00bb, je lui r\u00e9pondais qu\u2019il faudrait bien que je comprenne, moi, ce qu\u2019il \u00e9crit dans les documents qu\u2019il me rendra\u2026 Ceux-ci seront le plus souvent export\u00e9s au format PDF (puisque je les corrige sur mon iPad avec l\u2019application PDF Expert et mon stylet ). C\u2019est l\u00e0 un premier travail \u00e0 la notion de format. Et je voyais bien que pour eux une image, c\u2019est une image. gif, png, jpg, pdf, raw\u2026 Tout cela est bien loin de leurs pr\u00e9occupations. On a enfin remarqu\u00e9 que le correcteur orthographique n\u2019\u00e9tait pas toujours d\u2019une grande aide. Si l\u2019\u00e9l\u00e8ve \u00e9crit un mot dont l\u2019orthographe lui propose de grandes difficult\u00e9s, le traitement de texte ne saura pas lui proposer la solution. En revanche, en utilisant Le Petit Robert, c\u2019est autre chose. \u00c9crivons le mot phon\u00e9tiquement et le logiciel trouvera la solution ! S\u2019organiser \u29eb Nous utiliserons Evernote pour cr\u00e9er un cahier num\u00e9rique . \u00c7a a \u00e9t\u00e9 un moment int\u00e9ressant d\u2019expliquer que l\u2019informatique se d\u00e9veloppe \u00e0 coups de m\u00e9taphores . Celle du bureau, par exemple. Je n\u2019ai pas pu r\u00e9sister aux joies de l\u2019explication \u00e9tymologique. De la bure recouvrant la table, au bureau sur lequel on \u00e9crit, en terminant par le bureau de l\u2019ordinateur, on voit l\u00e0 combien la vie des mots est riche de significations. Mais revenons \u00e0 nos m\u00e9taphores. Evernote n\u2019y \u00e9chappe pas. Avec cette application, on prend des notes qui prennent place dans des carnets qu\u2019on peut cr\u00e9er autant que besoin est. Les carnets peuvent \u00eatre assembl\u00e9s, ce qu\u2019on appelles des piles. On a l\u00e0 une sorte de classeur, m\u00e9taphore que l\u2019on retrouve avec l\u2019application OneNote de Microsoft. On voit l\u00e0 que le num\u00e9rique reproduit le r\u00e9el. Rien de neuf sous le soleil, mais on voit bien aussi qu\u2019il y ajoute des fonctionnalit\u00e9s in\u00e9dites. Le classeur num\u00e9rique peut et doit \u00eatre partag\u00e9e . Avec moi, bien s\u00fbr mais aussi avec les autres \u00e9l\u00e8ves. J\u2019ai acc\u00e8s \u00e0 leur cahier en permanence. Les absents ont le mien en permanence. L\u2019application contenant un chat, c\u2019est comme si en ouvrant le cahier de l\u2019\u00e9l\u00e8ve, il y avait \u00e0 l\u2019int\u00e9rieur une possibilit\u00e9 de communication entre les \u00e9l\u00e8ves et leur professeur . C\u2019est d\u2019ailleurs une belle fa\u00e7on de communiquer des documents. Fin des photocopies. C\u2019est aussi un extraordinaire moyen de rattraper les cours que l\u2019on a manqu\u00e9s. Le rapport au cours \u29eb La machine en main, le comportement des \u00e9l\u00e8ves en classe a compl\u00e8tement chang\u00e9. En bien et en mal. Tout d\u2019abord, ils doivent comprendre que ce n\u2019est pas une version moderne de la fen\u00eatre par laquelle ils regardent pour tromper leur ennui. Bref, si l\u2019on n\u2019a pas besoin de l\u2019ordinateur, on le ferme. Je ne veux pas parler \u00e0 des \u00e9l\u00e8ves qui font autre chose. Mais quand ils notent (et il faut pr\u00e9ciser que nous avons r\u00e9ceptionn\u00e9 ces ordinateurs \u00e0 un moment o\u00f9 on faisait un travail tr\u00e8s classique de r\u00e9vision de la conjugaison), j\u2019ai remarqu\u00e9 un surcro\u00eet d\u2019attention . Habituellement, les \u00e9l\u00e8ves attendent que le malchanceux qui est au tableau ait fini d\u2019\u00e9crire pour recopier. L\u00e0, ils notaient en m\u00eame temps. Ne risquant pas de raturer un r\u00e9sultat incorrect, ils pouvaient sur leur traitement de texte tout noter sans risque d\u2019erreur et sans avoir \u00e0 recopier deux fois les choses (une fois au brouillon, une fois au propre). Ce ne sont l\u00e0 que quelques remarques, quelques observations rapides. Ce ne sont pas des pratiques num\u00e9riques extr\u00eamement d\u00e9velopp\u00e9es, mais les \u00e9l\u00e8ves ont eu le sentiment de d\u00e9couvrir une machine et des usages possibles auxquels ils n\u2019avaient jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 confront\u00e9s, alors m\u00eame qu\u2019ils sont des usagers depuis plusieurs ann\u00e9es. Et ce sur des choses tr\u00e8s simples ! Imaginez quand nous poursuivrons avec la web radio, la t\u00e9l\u00e9 ou l\u2019initiation au wikicode ! Il y a tant \u00e0 faire pour cr\u00e9er cette culture num\u00e9rique qui n\u2019appartient \u00e0 aucune mati\u00e8re et que parfois aucune mati\u00e8re ne saisit.","title":"Un ordinateur entre les mains d\u2019un coll\u00e9gien, \u00e7a change quoi ?"},{"location":"%C3%89criture/Medium/Un%20ordinateur%20entre%20les%20mains%20d%E2%80%99un%20coll%C3%A9gien%2C%20%C3%A7a%20change%20quoi%20%3F/#le-clavier","text":"M\u00eame si beaucoup de choses se font \u00e0 la souris, l\u2019utilisation de ce \u00ab p\u00e9riph\u00e9rique \u00bb s\u2019impose d\u00e8s les premiers instants.

Mes \u00e9l\u00e8ves avaient ainsi fait pr\u00e9c\u00e9der leurs contes d\u2019une petite vid\u00e9o explicative, une sorte de making of racontant ce qu\u2019ils avaient voulu faire passer comme message \u00e0 travers leurs histoires.

C'est de cette profusion des techniques dont t\u00e9moignent les mots en \u00ab -graphe \u00bb issus du grec \u00ab graphein \u00bb : photographe, radiographe, \u00e9chographe, t\u00e9l\u00e9graphe, phonographe, phonautographe, dactylographe, stylographe, etc. Pourquoi diable ferions-nous une fixation sur la seule orthographe ? A-t-on perdu cette passion plurielle d\u2019\u00e9crire ? Ou plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment s\u2019est-elle repli\u00e9e sur elle-m\u00eame dans le champ scolaire uniquement d\u00e9volu \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9criture \u00e0 la main ? Ces activit\u00e9s d\u2019\u00e9criture ne seront jamais pour certaines d\u2019entre elles d\u2019aucune esp\u00e8ce d\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat pour un \u00e9l\u00e8ve de 11 ans, mais le d\u00e9veloppement du num\u00e9rique ne nous rappelle-t-il pas que l\u2019\u00e9tendue de la \u00ab graphie \u00bb d\u00e9passe de loin nos habitudes scolaires et qu\u2019il faut que les \u00e9l\u00e8ves s\u2019emparent de ces techniques, non pas isol\u00e9ment, de fa\u00e7on cloisonn\u00e9e comme cela peut l\u2019\u00eatre aujourd\u2019hui dans telle ou telle mati\u00e8re (le son ici, l\u2019image l\u00e0), mais de fa\u00e7on synth\u00e9tique ? Les documents num\u00e9riques sont pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment constitu\u00e9s de tout cela, de textes, de sons, d\u2019images fixes ou mobiles. Pour Pierre L\u00e9vy, le num\u00e9rique pose \u00ab la question de la fin du logocentrisme, de la destitution d'une certaine supr\u00e9matie du discours sur les autres modes de communication \u00bb. Et s'il y a bien quelque chose d\u2019assez fascinant avec le num\u00e9rique, c'est qu'il permet \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9criture de se d\u00e9barrasser des inconv\u00e9nients que Socrate pouvait lui trouver : \u00ab C\u2019est que l\u2019\u00e9criture, Ph\u00e8dre, a, tout comme la peinture, un grave inconv\u00e9nient. Les \u0153uvres picturales paraissent comme vivantes ; mais, si tu les interroges, elles gardent un v\u00e9n\u00e9rable silence. Il en est de m\u00eame des discours \u00e9crits. Tu croirais certes qu\u2019ils parlent comme des personnes sens\u00e9es ; mais, si tu veux leur demander de t\u2019expliquer ce qu\u2019ils disent, ils te r\u00e9pondent toujours la m\u00eame chose. Une fois \u00e9crit, tout discours roule de tous c\u00f4t\u00e9s ; il tombe aussi bien chez ceux qui le comprennent que chez ceux pour lesquels il est sans int\u00e9r\u00eat ; il ne sait point \u00e0 qui il faut parler, ni avec qui il est bon de se taire. S\u2019il se voit m\u00e9pris\u00e9 ou injustement injuri\u00e9, il a toujours besoin du secours de son p\u00e8re, car il n\u2019est pas par lui-m\u00eame capable de se d\u00e9fendre ni de se secourir. \u00bb Ainsi l\u2019\u00e9crit n\u2019est plus jamais fig\u00e9 \u00ab en un v\u00e9n\u00e9rable silence \u00bb. Le lecteur peut toujours demander des explications et l\u2019auteur peut r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 travers les commentaires ou les modifications et les processus de mise \u00e0 jour. Ainsi Wikip\u00e9dia est pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment (et contrairement \u00e0 ce qu\u2019affirmait \u00e0 Eidos 64 Milad Doueihi) l\u2019absence de consensus. L\u2019auteur et chercheur interview\u00e9 par la journaliste Louise Tourret affirmait que l\u2019encyclop\u00e9die p\u00eachait par sa recherche syst\u00e9matique du consensus et que la science \u00e9tait l\u2019oppos\u00e9e du consensus. Or c\u2019est tout \u00e0 fait faux ou plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment, si Wikip\u00e9dia pr\u00e9tend donner un acc\u00e8s aux informations brutes et qu\u2019en effet elle recherche une certaine objectivit\u00e9, on ne peut nier que derri\u00e8re chaque page de l\u2019encyclop\u00e9die, ce sont des dizaines et parfois des centaines de pages de discussions et de d\u00e9bats. En somme, il y a l\u00e0 une vivacit\u00e9 (au sens propre) de l\u2019id\u00e9e, une certaine plasticit\u00e9 \u00e0 laquelle il faudrait sensibiliser les \u00e9l\u00e8ves. \u00c9crire, ce n\u2019est plus penser une fois et publier et \u00e9ventuellement r\u00e9diger un nouveau livre parce qu\u2019on a progress\u00e9 dans ses recherches, c\u2019est un continuel r\u00e9ajustement de sa pens\u00e9e confront\u00e9e \u00e0 celle d\u2019autrui. Ce n\u2019est pas la moindre merveille du num\u00e9rique que de permettre aux \u00e9l\u00e8ves d\u2019acqu\u00e9rir tr\u00e8s t\u00f4t cette aptitude \u00e0 \u00e9crire et donc \u00e0 manier le langage. En fait, d\u00e8s le plus jeune \u00e2ge, on peut amener les enfants sinon \u00e0 \u00e9crire du moins \u00e0 parler. C\u2019est ce que de nombreux enseignants font avec des applications qui permettent d\u2019enregistrer les \u00e9l\u00e8ves. S\u2019ils ne peuvent \u00e9crire, du moins savent-ils parler et d\u00e8s lors on peut les amener tr\u00e8s t\u00f4t \u00e0 s\u2019exprimer, \u00e0 articuler, \u00e0 mieux prononcer certains mots et m\u00eame \u00e0 structurer un r\u00e9cit. M'inspirant des pratiques de V\u00e9ronique Favre, je me suis amus\u00e9 \u00e0 le faire un \u00e9t\u00e9 avec ma fille quand elle avait 5 ou 6 ans. J\u2019ai une forte aversion pour les cahiers de vacances. Pour autant, je suis quand m\u00eame un peu d\u00e9sireux, en parent soucieux de l\u2019\u00e9ducation de mes enfants, de faire travailler ces derniers. Sans pour autant sacrifier \u00e0 d\u2019imp\u00e9rieuses exigences, j\u2019ai eu envie d\u2019utiliser l\u2019iPad pour \u00e0 la fois passer un bon moment avec la petite derni\u00e8re mais aussi pour la faire travailler. J\u2019avais \u00e9galement dans l\u2019id\u00e9e de rel\u00e9guer au second plan le travail d\u2019\u00e9criture, de graphie ou d\u2019orthographe (lesquels seront largement trait\u00e9s tout au long de la scolarit\u00e9) et d\u2019accorder davantage d\u2019importance \u00e0 des points importants parfois d\u00e9l\u00e9gu\u00e9s \u00e0 des sp\u00e9cialistes extrascolaires, que ceux-ci soient orthophonistes ou conteurs professionnels : l\u2019\u00e9locution, la prononciation, mais aussi l\u2019\u00e9laboration et la diction d\u2019un r\u00e9cit. Un point non n\u00e9gligeable \u00e9tait \u00e0 prendre en compte : le travail r\u00e9alis\u00e9 ferait l\u2019objet d\u2019une diffusion d\u2019abord familiale (projection sur la t\u00e9l\u00e9), puis d\u2019une mise en ligne sur YouTube. Pour ce faire, nous avons opt\u00e9 pour le spectacle de marionnettes avec l\u2019application PuppetPals HD. Nous avons \u00e9labor\u00e9 diff\u00e9rentes s\u00e9quences (en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral correspondant aux changements de personnages) puis nous avons mont\u00e9 le tout dans iMovie. Avec les plus grands, il est possible d\u2019arriver un r\u00e9sultat similaire (un film mont\u00e9 sur iMovie) mais apr\u00e8s \u00e9criture d\u2019un sc\u00e9nario. Quelle que soit l\u2019activit\u00e9 envisag\u00e9e, on passe par une activit\u00e9 d\u2019\u00e9criture. \u00c0 ce propos, un \u00e9l\u00e8ve doit apprendre \u00e0 taper sur un clavier. \u00c0 lui les joies de la dactylographie. Il est hors de question de le voir continuer \u00e0 taper \u00e0 deux doigts (grand maximum). Et, comme un vrai codeur, il a les mains riv\u00e9es sur le clavier, usant de tous les raccourcis possibles et imaginables. En attendant la g\u00e9n\u00e9ralisation d'une telle pratique, il n'est pas rare de voir qu'un ordinateur a \u00e9t\u00e9 confi\u00e9 \u00e0 un \u00e9l\u00e8ve dyspraxique, dyslexique et dysorthographique. Et de constater que le rem\u00e8de est pire que le mal. \u00c9crire vite et bien sur un clavier n'est pas plus ais\u00e9 qu'\u00e0 la main. Dext\u00e9rit\u00e9 et v\u00e9locit\u00e9 ne sont pas inn\u00e9es. Cela s'acquiert. Il faut que l'\u00e9cole le permette. L\u2019\u00e9l\u00e8ve est polyglotte \u29eb Se couper de l\u2019anglais, c\u2019est se couper d\u2019une partie consid\u00e9rable du web, cette invention et (quasi) propri\u00e9t\u00e9 am\u00e9ricaine. Il existe tant d\u2019informations disponibles en anglais et uniquement en anglais ! Et il existe de si belles applications pour l\u2019apprendre que ce serait un crime de s\u2019en passer. Babbel et English Central sont deux exemples fameux, mais on peut aussi \u00e9voquer Pilipop ou Duolingo, non limit\u00e9es \u00e0 l\u2019anglais. Compte tenu du nombre d\u2019applications qui ne sont pas traduites en anglais, l\u2019utilisateur est de plus en plus amen\u00e9 \u00e0 se familiariser avec le vocabulaire anglo-saxon. Les \u00ab Save \u00bb, \u00ab File \u00bb ou autre \u00ab Link \u00bb sont d\u00e9sormais des mots extr\u00eamement courants, \u00e0 un tel point que l\u2019Acad\u00e9mie fran\u00e7aise peine \u00e0 faire accepter certaines traductions comme la baladodiffusion. Qu'on le veuille ou non, le bain linguistique est quotidien. \u00c0 ce propos, c\u2019est surtout quand j\u2019ai d\u00e9couvert les podcasts que je me suis rendu compte combien il devenait ais\u00e9 de travailler les langues. C\u2019est en fait en 2005 lorsqu\u2019Apple a int\u00e9gr\u00e9 le support du podcast dans la version 4.9 d\u2019iTunes que je me suis aper\u00e7u de la richesse d\u2019\u00e9missions qui renouvelaient ce qui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 fait avec la radio dans les ann\u00e9es 1930 mais en laissant le loisir \u00e0 l\u2019auditeur de t\u00e9l\u00e9charger et d\u2019\u00e9couter ad libitum les fichiers de son choix. Je me souviens en particulier d\u2019une \u00e9mission qui existe toujours et qui s\u2019appelle English As A Second Language Podcast et qui a d\u00e9pass\u00e9 depuis le millier d\u2019\u00e9pisodes. Son auteur, Jeff McQuillan, est un enseignant vivant \u00e0 Los Angeles. Le principe de l\u2019\u00e9mission (du moins \u00e0 sa cr\u00e9ation) est de vous aider \u00e0 am\u00e9liorer votre anglais en vous proposant des sujets aussi divers qu\u2019aller au restaurant ou au cin\u00e9ma, acheter un ordinateur ou faire le m\u00e9nage. Dans la premi\u00e8re partie de l\u2019\u00e9mission, le texte est dit tr\u00e8s lentement de fa\u00e7on \u00e0 vous permettre de comprendre du mieux que vous pouvez ce qui est dit. Une deuxi\u00e8me partie est une explication enti\u00e8rement en anglais des mots de vocabulaire li\u00e9s au th\u00e8me de l\u2019\u00e9mission. Enfin la derni\u00e8re partie r\u00e9p\u00e8te le texte initial mais \u00e0 une vitesse normale. Le podcast s\u2019ach\u00e8ve sur quelques r\u00e9ponses \u00e0 des questions envoy\u00e9es par des auditeurs sur des points de grammaire ou de vocabulaire. Ce podcast est une aide extraordinaire \u00e0 l\u2019acquisition de connaissances linguistiques. L\u2019acte de se mettre ses \u00e9couteurs sur les oreilles (\u00ab podcast \u00bb provient de \u00ab iPod \u00bb et de \u00ab broadcast \u00bb), la r\u00e9gularit\u00e9 de l\u2019\u00e9coute du podcast, le c\u00f4t\u00e9 artisanal de l\u2019\u00e9mission (du moins pour les premi\u00e8res), la voix sympathique et attentionn\u00e9e du locuteur cr\u00e9ent un sentiment de proximit\u00e9 avec l\u2019auteur. Il en va de m\u00eame des centaines de tutoriels que j\u2019ai pu suivre, bien avant la mode des YouTubeurs, et qui venant principalement des \u00c9tats-Unis dans un premier temps vous contraignaient \u00e0 conna\u00eetre l\u2019anglais (de m\u00eame si vous voulez suivre ces grands show que sont, par exemple, les keynote d\u2019Apple). Mais aujourd\u2019hui les tutoriels ou les podcasts affluent du monde entier, aussi bien de France que de Cor\u00e9e du Sud. Et on aurait tort de penser que les \u00e9l\u00e8ves ne les regardent pas. D'autres plateformes ont vu le jour. Je pense, entre autres, \u00e0 SoundCloud (ce r\u00e9seau social du son) qui permet notamment de diffuser des podcasts mais aussi des chansons, des livres audio ou m\u00eame des cours. Ce blog illustre les diff\u00e9rents moyens qui s'offrent \u00e0 vous pour perfectionner votre ma\u00eetrise d'une langue, comme \u00e9couter de la musique gratuite dont les paroles sont en ligne. Plus amusante est la possibilit\u00e9 de mettre vos propres enregistrements en ligne afin de confronter votre connaissance de la langue ainsi que votre prononciation aux usagers du r\u00e9seau et recevoir leurs remarques. Mieux encore, cr\u00e9ez un groupe, une communaut\u00e9 d'utilisateurs. Vous pourrez commenter et ins\u00e9rer votre commentaire \u00e0 l'endroit pr\u00e9cis du fichier sur lequel vous souhaitez intervenir ou obtenir une pr\u00e9cision, une information ou une explication. Le succ\u00e8s des s\u00e9ries est un avatar d'un autre succ\u00e8s, celui qu\u2019ont pu conna\u00eetre les romans-feuilletons (qu\u2019on appelait d\u2019ailleurs les feuilletons romans) au XIXe si\u00e8cle. \u00c0 cette \u00e9poque, Alexandre Dumas ou Eug\u00e8ne Sue \u00e9taient les auteurs en vogue et les histoires qu\u2019ils publiaient par \u00e9pisodes dans les journ\u00e9es explosaient les ventes. Aujourd\u2019hui, cet engouement s\u2019est d\u00e9plac\u00e9 et se trouve dans les s\u00e9ries qui fascinent les spectateurs et les font piaffer d\u2019impatience dans l\u2019attente que leur s\u00e9rie pr\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9e arrive en France parfois avec des traductions plus ou moins heureuses et parfois avec une diffusion al\u00e9atoire des \u00e9pisodes. Les fans de s\u00e9ries se sont alors mis \u00e0 t\u00e9l\u00e9charger sur des sites \u00e0 la l\u00e9galit\u00e9 douteuse des \u00e9pisodes pour lesquels ils n\u2019avaient pas envie d\u2019attendre. Comme ceux-ci \u00e9taient disponibles d\u00e8s le lendemain, l\u2019attente \u00e9tait de courte dur\u00e9e. Mais en un temps si court, l\u2019\u00e9pisode est \u00e9videmment disponible en VO. Et de fait, on a pu remarquer que nos plus jeunes \u00e9l\u00e8ves d\u00e9voraient les m\u00eames s\u00e9ries que leurs professeurs, et cela dans la langue de Shakespeare. Pourvu que la chose se fasse dans la l\u00e9galit\u00e9, il serait bon que cette passion t\u00e9l\u00e9visuelle soit exploit\u00e9e en classe. Les ann\u00e9es passant, j'ai remarqu\u00e9 que je devenais plus exigeant avec mes enfants et que je leur demandais syst\u00e9matiquement de choisir (sur Netflix) la version originale. Bien s\u00fbr, il n\u2019y a pas que l\u2019anglais. Comme la Chine est le nouveau territoire de jeu des entrepreneurs, il serait temps de proposer ou de g\u00e9n\u00e9raliser l\u2019apprentissage de cette langue. Sur le clavier virtuel de votre smartphone, vous avez d\u00e9j\u00e0 le clavier (les claviers) n\u00e9cessaire(s). Quelle que soit la langue que vous choisirez, pourquoi ne pas utiliser Skype in the classroom ? Vous pouvez m\u00eame jouer au Mystery Skype et trouver une classe dans le monde entier. Le principe est simple. Vous conversez avec une classe inconnue et \u00e0 propos de laquelle vous ne savez rien. Le but du jeu est de d\u00e9couvrir d\u2019o\u00f9 ils viennent, dans quel pays ils habitent, dans quelle ville, etc. Ce petit jeu linguistique n\u2019a absolument rien de fantaisiste, n\u2019a rien d\u2019improvis\u00e9 et requiert de la classe et de l\u2019enseignant une pr\u00e9paration et une organisation importantes, comme en t\u00e9moigne le blog de ce professeur. Pour jouer \u00e0 ce jeu qui engage tous les \u00e9l\u00e8ves, il faut pr\u00e9parer des questions pertinentes sur un document partag\u00e9 et un autre o\u00f9 seront consign\u00e9es les questions et les r\u00e9ponses, apprendre \u00e0 utiliser diverses ressources comme un atlas ou des dictionnaires en ligne, assigner \u00e0 chacun un r\u00f4le (les chercheurs, ceux qui accueillent la classe, ceux qui posent les questions, ceux qui \u00e9crivent les informations re\u00e7ues, ceux qui organisent les prises de parole, ceux qui pr\u00e9sentent les photos qu\u2019ils ont prises, ceux qui sont charg\u00e9s du respect des r\u00e8gles typographiques ou orthographiques, etc.). Un tel jeu linguistique est une v\u00e9ritable immersion et procure un petit frisson. C\u2019est un petit voyage chez soi. Je trouve le proc\u00e9d\u00e9 vraiment fabuleux. Au reste, on le verra plus bas, d\u2019autres applications permettent de revisiter la notion de correspondance et de s\u2019adresser potentiellement au monde entier. Je crois aussi que la lecture num\u00e9rique est une invitation \u00e0 lire sans appr\u00e9hension un texte en langue \u00e9trang\u00e8re. Les dictionnaires int\u00e9gr\u00e9s pouvant \u00eatre convoqu\u00e9s \u00e0 partir du mot qui pose un probl\u00e8me facilitent l\u2019appropriation du lexique. D\u2019ailleurs, quel \u00e9l\u00e8ve ne recourt pas au c\u00e9l\u00e8bre Google Translate, dont l\u2019utilisation (d\u2019un point de vue scolaire) n\u2019est pas si \u00e9vidente que cela ? Il faudrait aider les \u00e9l\u00e8ves \u00e0 utiliser \u00e0 bon escient une telle application et surtout \u00e0 ne pas lui accorder une confiance aveugle. Les professeurs de langue savent bien de quoi je veux parler. C'est lors de la semaine de la presse que je me suis aper\u00e7u que la barri\u00e8re de la langue n'en \u00e9tait plus une. J'avais montr\u00e9 aux \u00e9l\u00e8ves comment utiliser Feedly et l'un d'eux s'\u00e9tait abonn\u00e9 au flux RSS de The Verge, car il \u00e9tait int\u00e9ress\u00e9 par les voitures. Il avait utilis\u00e9 Google Translate, qui s'en sortait plut\u00f4t bien et qui rendait accessible ce qui auparavant ne l'\u00e9tait pas. L\u2019\u00e9l\u00e8ve est un grand lecteur \u29eb Combien de textes, de lignes, de mots lit-on par jour ? Notices en tout genre, signalisation, post it, consignes, journaux, le\u00e7ons, extraits, contes, romans, c'est l'empire du signe. De m\u00eame que le num\u00e9rique a donn\u00e9 une profusion d'\u00e9crivains (ou, si le mot vous para\u00eet trop fort, d'\u00e9crivants, pour reprendre le mot de Roland Barthes), de m\u00eame (corollairement) y a-t-il une profusion de lecteurs. On n'a jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 autant lu. M\u00eame la recherche d'une vid\u00e9o est pr\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9e de la lecture des r\u00e9sultats par votre moteur. Peut-\u00eatre ne lit-on pas toujours de ces grands ouvrages qui font notre fiert\u00e9 quand nous les exposons sur les rayons de notre biblioth\u00e8que, mais enfin on lit. On lit la presse qui s'est adapt\u00e9e, parfois enrichie dans sa version num\u00e9rique qui par la m\u00eame occasion \u00e0 engendr\u00e9 de nouveaux acteurs : les pure players mais aussi les blogs et les tweets des journalistes. Mon application de lecture de flux RSS me fait chaque jour un peu plus penser au tonneau des Dana\u00efdes : je la remplis sans cesse et je vais pouvoir continuer encore longtemps. C'est d\u00e9sormais une bonne centaine de sites qui y sont r\u00e9unis. Et encore cet amas a pour voisin mes comptes Facebook et Twitter qui soumettent \u00e0 ma voracit\u00e9 encore un peu plus de suggestions de lectures. Or, on le constate lors de la semaine de la presse, lire sur le web est une pratique quasi inconnue de nos \u00e9l\u00e8ves. Combien savent ce qu\u2019est un agr\u00e9gateur de contenu ? Ce qu\u2019est un fichier XML ou un flux RSS ? Qui conna\u00eet Readability, Instapaper (qui m'a consid\u00e9rablement aid\u00e9 \u00e0 r\u00e9diger le livre que vous lisez) ou Pocket ? Combien savent garder, ordonner ce flot d\u2019informations quotidien, archiver, annoter et retrouver les notes de leur lecture ? Il est aussi possible d\u2019archiver tel ou tel passage dans son application pr\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9e de prise de notes. Pour ma part, je fais des captures d\u2019\u00e9cran des passages des livres qui m\u2019ont int\u00e9ress\u00e9. Et puisqu\u2019une application comme Evernote (OCR oblige) est capable de chercher du texte dans une image, cela ne pose aucun probl\u00e8me \u00e0 cette m\u00e9thode d\u2019archivage qui s\u2019est impos\u00e9e \u00e0 moi je ne sais trop comment. Peut-\u00eatre parce que certains livres prot\u00e9g\u00e9s par des DRM ne facilitent pas vraiment l\u2019option de partage. Les DRM sont \u00e0 eux seuls un v\u00e9ritable plaidoyer en d\u00e9faveur du livre num\u00e9rique, du moins quand il en est pourvu, ainsi que la d\u00e9cision de certains \u00e9diteurs de d\u00e9sactiver le copier/coller. Cette ablation technique me fait en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral consid\u00e9rer que le piratage est pr\u00e9f\u00e9rable \u00e0 la l\u00e9galit\u00e9 qui ne vous permet pas de faire des choses tr\u00e8s simples comme copier un extrait qu\u2019on voudrait par exemple donner \u00e0 ses \u00e9l\u00e8ves. Heureusement il existe plusieurs solutions comme les OCR (bis repetita). Combien d'\u00e9l\u00e8ves savent automatiser cette proc\u00e9dure d'archivage avec une application comme IFTTT par exemple ? Combien savent partager leur lecture ? Il y a l\u00e0 une urgence \u00e0 enseigner ces nouvelles fa\u00e7ons de lire et on per\u00e7oit facilement combien ces nouveaux usages am\u00e9lioreraient significativement les performances des \u00e9l\u00e8ves. Je crois m\u00eame qu\u2019il y a simplement urgence \u00e0 leur r\u00e9v\u00e9ler cette richesse du web qui ne se borne pas \u00e0 ce que propose Facebook, ce site faisant tout pour vous rendre captif de son r\u00e9seau et vous \u00e9viter d\u2019aller voir ailleurs. De plus, l\u2019acte de lire, au XXIe si\u00e8cle, s\u2019est consid\u00e9rablement complexifi\u00e9. C\u2019est devenu un art \u00e0 part enti\u00e8re que de savoir user de toutes les fonctionnalit\u00e9s li\u00e9es au livre num\u00e9rique. Et lire est un enjeu majeur tant il est vrai que l\u2019acc\u00e8s \u00e0 la connaissance est conditionn\u00e9 par cette comp\u00e9tence. Mais surtout on lit partout, tout le temps. Les fichiers num\u00e9riques (le PDF, le doc, l\u2019odt, le html, l\u2019ePub\u2026) sont commenc\u00e9s ici et termin\u00e9s l\u00e0. Avec la multiplication des terminaux, on lit sur sa tablette, sur son t\u00e9l\u00e9phone, sur sa liseuse, sur son ordinateur et la synchronisation de tous ces objets sans qu'on n\u2019ait rien \u00e0 faire est une incitation \u00e0 reprendre sa lecture o\u00f9 que l\u2019on soit et quel que soit l\u2019appareil que l\u2019on a sur soi \u00e0 ce moment-l\u00e0. D\u00e9couvrir la liseuse a \u00e9t\u00e9 pour moi le d\u00e9but d\u2019une longue histoire d\u2019amour, et d\u2019un progressif \u00e9loignement du livre papier (\u00e9loignement que je ne cherche pas \u00e0 imposer \u00e0 qui que ce soit). \u00c0 force de lire sur ma liseuse, je trouve que le livre (disons traditionnel, mais \u00e7a ne veut tellement rien dire si l\u2019on pense \u00e0 ses multiples m\u00e9tamorphoses, du volumen au codex) a pour lui plusieurs inconv\u00e9nients : son poids, ses pages qui ne tiennent pas et qui se rabattent, l\u2019ombre de la main (ou simplement toute ombre r\u00e9sultant de la position du livre par rapport \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re) sur la page la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 d\u2019avoir un \u00e9clairage pour lire (c\u2019est tout b\u00eate mais avec la liseuse, j\u2019ai fini par oublier que j\u2019avais besoin d\u2019une source de lumi\u00e8re pour lire), l\u2019encre qui s\u2019efface (du moins celle de ces affreux livres de poche) les traces de doigt ou de tout ce que vous pouvez manipuler lors de votre lecture (allant de la nourriture au c\u00e9rumen, en passant par les crottes de nez. Que celui qui ne s\u2019est jamais livr\u00e9 \u00e0 une telle pratique me jette la premi\u00e8re\u2026 ce que vous voulez...) le papier de mauvaise qualit\u00e9 (car les lecteurs ne sont pas tous assez fortun\u00e9s pour se payer de beaux livres imprim\u00e9s sur du v\u00e9lin). En revanche, force est de constater qu\u2019avec une liseuse, on perd plusieurs choses : on voit moins la couverture et on m\u00e9morise donc moins bien le nom de l\u2019auteur ; on perd la conscience de l\u2019\u00e9paisseur du livre et de l\u2019endroit o\u00f9 l\u2019on se situe. Avec une liseuse, on peut ainsi tr\u00e8s facilement se trouver tout surpris d\u2019\u00eatre \u00e0 la fin (sp\u00e9cialement quand une partie du pourcentage comprend diverses choses comme une postface ou un sommaire). Mais ce n\u2019est pas sans procurer quelque nouvelle \u00e9motion litt\u00e9raire tant on est d\u00e9concert\u00e9 de se trouver \u00e0 la derni\u00e8re page sans que rien ne nous y ait pr\u00e9par\u00e9. Cela dit, il est facile d\u2019afficher la barre de progression, et de voir o\u00f9 on se trouve, mais je n\u2019utilise que fort peu cette possibilit\u00e9. le livre se pr\u00eate moins ais\u00e9ment ; il se donne encore moins et m\u00eame s'il existe quelques solutions plus ou moins l\u00e9gales, il est concevable que ces inconv\u00e9nients freinent les ardeurs de lecteurs d\u00e9sireux de go\u00fbter aux joies de la lecture num\u00e9rique. Toutefois, on remarquera que les avantages l\u2019emportent largement sur les quelques inconv\u00e9nients qui peuvent se transformer en avantage (du moins pour le second). Je n'ai pas mentionn\u00e9 la batterie qui tient des semaines. Avec la liseuse, j\u2019appr\u00e9cie aussi de pouvoir acc\u00e9der instantan\u00e9ment au livre d\u00e9sir\u00e9. Je n\u2019ai pas m\u00eame besoin de me lever pour lire le dernier prix Goncourt. Certains trouveront que c\u2019est un d\u00e9faut. C\u2019est affaire de point de vue. Pour moi qui ai habit\u00e9 dans des lieux o\u00f9 la culture \u00e9tait peu accessible, j\u2019y ai vu un net avantage. Et puis m\u00eame si on peut trouver \u00e0 redire sur les livres et sa vente qui s\u2019apparente davantage \u00e0 de la location, il faudra quand m\u00eame reconna\u00eetre qu\u2019une application comme Calibre vous d\u00e9barrasse relativement facilement de la plupart des DRM ind\u00e9sirables. Enfin, si vous regrettez l'interm\u00e9diaire que constitue le libraire, sachez qu'il y a aussi YouTube et que nos youtubeurs ne font plus uniquement de petits sketchs rigolos ou ne prodiguent plus uniquement des conseils de maquillage. Non, sur YouTube, on parle \u00e9galement lecture. On parle alors de BookTube. Autre exemple, le Boloss des Belles Lettres r\u00e9v\u00e8le la pr\u00e9gnance de la litt\u00e9rature y compris sur la toile. Force est bien de reconna\u00eetre que la lecture n\u2019est plus vraiment un vice (impuni) ou en tout cas que la lecture est devenue \u00e9minemment sociale. L\u2019\u00e9l\u00e8ve est un \u00eatre sociable \u29eb Le num\u00e9rique est une invitation \u00e0 la promiscuit\u00e9, au \u00ab vivre ensemble \u00bb, \u00e0 la sociabilisation, au partage de l\u2019information. Non seulement l\u2019\u00e9l\u00e8ve partage mais il en tire un grand b\u00e9n\u00e9fice. S\u2019il lit (m\u00eame un tweet), il le partage. Il \u00e9crit tout un livre ? Il le diffuse sur Wattpad. Il d\u00e9veloppe des connaissances ? Il les offre au regard d\u2019autrui. Il les publie, par exemple sur Vikidia, et comprend que l\u2019\u00e9criture peut-\u00eatre collaborative. Il l\u2019a d\u00e9couvert sur un \u00ab pad \u00bb, il approfondit cette comp\u00e9tence en \u00e9crivant pour et avec autrui. La chose n\u2019est pas nouvelle. M\u00eame la traditionnelle r\u00e9daction est d\u00e9j\u00e0 une \u0153uvre collective : le sujet est donn\u00e9 par l\u2019enseignant qui donne des conseils, l\u2019\u00e9l\u00e8ve \u00e9crit et est ensuite aid\u00e9 par ses parents, fr\u00e8res ou s\u0153urs... Enfin l'enseignant corrige... Les devoirs que les enseignants donnent \u00e0 leurs \u00e9l\u00e8ves sont tr\u00e8s souvent r\u00e9alis\u00e9s collaborativement. Qu'ils chattent, se fassent \u00ab une cam \u00bb (visioconf\u00e9rence) ou demandent de l'aide sur les r\u00e9seaux sociaux ou dans les commentaires, nos \u00e9l\u00e8ves ont d\u00e9j\u00e0 commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 apprendre ensemble. Les \u00e9l\u00e8ves au d\u00e9but du si\u00e8cle s\u2019\u00e9taient empar\u00e9s du blog et \u00e9crivaient massivement. C\u2019\u00e9tait l\u2019\u00e9poque des skyblogs. Le 22 novembre 2009, il y avait 28 416 340 blogs accessibles via Skyrock.com. On avait connu l\u2019\u00e9poque de la R\u00e9publique des blogs et les coll\u00e9giens n\u2019\u00e9chappaient pas \u00e0 cette mode. C\u2019\u00e9tait avant l\u2019invasion massive des r\u00e9seaux sociaux. Certes les textes publi\u00e9s n\u2019\u00e9taient pas d\u2019une grande qualit\u00e9. Souvent la typographie, les choix esth\u00e9tiques et surtout l\u2019orthographe piquaient all\u00e8grement les yeux, mais enfin il faut tout de m\u00eame reconna\u00eetre qu\u2019on ne pouvait pas reprocher \u00e0 nos \u00e9l\u00e8ves d\u2019\u00e9crire. Le plus triste dans tout cela est que l\u2019\u00c9ducation nationale et donc les enseignants (moi y compris) n\u2019aient pas \u00e9t\u00e9 fichus de les accompagner dans cette pratique. C\u2019est pourtant dommage. Cet article de madmoiZelle.com montre bien ce que peut repr\u00e9senter cette plong\u00e9e dans \u00ab l\u2019univers de tes 14 ans \u00bb, car on peut maintenant mesurer l\u2019effet des pratiques li\u00e9es \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9criture et \u00e0 la lecture sur le web et \u00e9duquer s\u00e9rieusement les \u00e9l\u00e8ves. Mais d\u00e9j\u00e0 on peut comprendre \u00e0 quel point devenir un \u00ab \u00eatre sociable \u00bb est compliqu\u00e9. \u00catre confront\u00e9 \u00e0 la question des droits, entrer dans la hi\u00e9rarchie des gens populaires, exprimer l\u00e0 o\u00f9 c\u2019est possible ses sentiments, \u00eatre confront\u00e9 \u00e0 la dure loi des commentaires, savoir r\u00e9pondre ou ne pas r\u00e9pondre et savoir que tout cela est inscrit durablement, car ce qui est publi\u00e9 sur internet\u2026 reste publi\u00e9 sur internet et pour longtemps. La premi\u00e8re fois que je me suis aper\u00e7u que mes \u00e9l\u00e8ves \u00e9taient eux aussi sur Twitter, j\u2019ai d\u00e9couvert des propos vraiment stup\u00e9fiants. Ils \u00e9taient en train de s\u2019\u00e9charper et s\u2019insultaient copieusement, publiquement et sans retenue avec une vulgarit\u00e9 que je n\u2019aurais pas soup\u00e7onn\u00e9e chez certains d\u2019entre eux. D\u2019ailleurs, il m\u2019arrive de mettre \u00e0 la poubelle certains commentaires sur mon site. Ce sont des tombereaux d\u2019insultes quand, par exemple, il n\u2019y a pas le corrig\u00e9 d\u2019un questionnaire sur tel ou tel livre. J\u2019ai du mal \u00e0 ne pas faire le lien avec ce qui s\u2019est pass\u00e9 avec l\u2019intelligence artificielle de Microsoft. Le 23 mars, Tay, est une machine, une IA, qui tweete pour la premi\u00e8re fois. Son profil est celui d\u2019une adolescente plut\u00f4t sympathique. Le principe de son fonctionnement est simple. Plus on lui parle, plus son vocabulaire et sa capacit\u00e9 de raisonnement s\u2019\u00e9toffent. Malheureusement, si tout se passe bien au d\u00e9but (\u00ab les humains sont super cools \u00bb, d\u00e9clare Tay), ses propos deviennent rapidement misogynes et racistes jusqu\u2019\u00e0 s\u2019exclamer \u00ab Hitler avait raison et je hais tous les juifs \u00bb. Que s\u2019est-il pass\u00e9 ? Eh bien, c\u2019est fort simple. Tous les trolls du web se sont donn\u00e9 rendez-vous pour discuter avec l\u2019IA de Microsoft et forts de la conviction que l\u2019IA s\u2019impr\u00e9gnait par imitation de ce qu\u2019on lui disait, ils n\u2019ont eu de cesse que de lui ass\u00e9ner des propos tous plus ind\u00e9cents les uns que les autres. En somme, l\u2019IA s\u2019est fa\u00e7onn\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019image de ce qui lui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 renvoy\u00e9. C\u2019\u00e9tait une sorte de perroquet. Comment ne pas se dire que les adolescents - les vrais - fonctionnent de la m\u00eame fa\u00e7on. Une sorte de mim\u00e9tisme, de psittacisme qu'on d\u00e9signe g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement par l'expression effet de mode ou qui rel\u00e8ve plus banalement d'une p\u00e9riode de la vie pousse les adolescents \u00e0 s'impr\u00e9gner des propos des autres. On ne peut les laisser livr\u00e9s \u00e0 eux-m\u00eames. Or c\u2019est ce qui arrive si l\u2019\u00e9cole ne leur apprend pas \u00e0 \u00eatre des cr\u00e9atures sociables, polies et respectueuses. Il y a mille et une fa\u00e7ons d\u2019apprendre \u00e0 l\u2019enfant \u00e0 \u00eatre sociable sur le web. Entre autres, cela faisait longtemps que je projetais de faire \u00e9crire \u00e0 mes \u00e9l\u00e8ves des articles pour l\u2019encyclop\u00e9die libre Vikidia, ce Wikip\u00e9dia \u00e0 destination des 8-13 ans. J\u2019h\u00e9sitais seulement encore un peu sur le choix des articles \u00e0 \u00e9crire. Est-ce que dans un travail interdisciplinaire, j\u2019aiderai les \u00e9l\u00e8ves \u00e0 r\u00e9diger leur article sur une machine \u00e0 fraiser ou sur la digestion ? En tapant \u00ab star wars \u00bb puis \u00ab bb-8 \u00bb dans Vikidia, je me suis aper\u00e7u que, pour le second, l\u2019article \u00e9tait inexistant. Connaissant l\u2019engouement des \u00e9l\u00e8ves pour le nouveau Star Wars (on \u00e9tait en d\u00e9cembre 2015 \u00e0 ce moment-l\u00e0), je me suis aussit\u00f4t dit : \u00ab Bingo ! Voil\u00e0 ce qu\u2019il faut faire \u00bb. C\u2019est l\u2019occasion r\u00eav\u00e9e d\u2019initier les \u00e9l\u00e8ves \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9criture d\u2019articles encyclop\u00e9diques, mais aussi \u00e0 la notion de libre, de partage, etc. C\u2019est un travail fabuleux \u00e0 r\u00e9aliser avec les \u00e9l\u00e8ves : chercher des informations, prendre ce qui est n\u00e9cessaire, le conserver tout en le notant avec ses mots \u00e0 soi (et non recopier, tout un d\u00e9fi qui entend enfin mettre un terme au copier-coller), l\u2019ordonner et garder les r\u00e9f\u00e9rences exactes de ses sources, r\u00e9diger en soignant l\u2019orthographe mais aussi la ponctuation puis la syntaxe wiki (les balises n\u00e9cessaires \u00e0 la mise en page d\u2019une page sur un wiki). Tout cela constitue un travail important dont la finalit\u00e9 est celle d\u2019une contribution \u00e0 une encyclop\u00e9die libre. Ce n'est pas rien. C'est tout de m\u00eame la premi\u00e8re fois dans l'histoire de l'humanit\u00e9 que des enfants participent \u00e0 un tel projet encyclop\u00e9dique. Dans le cadre de la classe, les \u00e9l\u00e8ves ont travaill\u00e9 par groupes. Ils d\u00e9couvrent en publiant sur Vikidia que d\u2019autres lecteurs voient ce qui est \u00e9crit, le lisent, le corrigent, le commentent, le compl\u00e8tent, l\u2019enrichissent. \u00c0 tout moment, ils peuvent remonter dans le temps et comparer les diff\u00e9rentes versions du travail collectif. Une chose assez amusante \u00e0 noter : des \u00e9l\u00e8ves n\u2019avaient pas eu le temps de finir leur article. La sonnerie venait de retentir. Ils enregistrent leur article sur l\u2019encyclop\u00e9die. Quelques minutes apr\u00e8s, deux contributeurs avaient achev\u00e9 de mettre en forme le travail des \u00e9l\u00e8ves. \u00c9crire est donc une \u0153uvre collaborative. C\u2019est un processus stimulant dans lequel on ne sent jamais seul et qui a une finalit\u00e9 qui exc\u00e8de la finalit\u00e9 du devoir habituel que l\u2019\u00e9l\u00e8ve n\u2019a pas envie d\u2019\u00e9crire et que le professeur n\u2019a pas envie de corriger. De plus, les \u00e9l\u00e8ves comprennent bien qu\u2019un mauvais travail ne fera pas long feu sur Vikidia. Des erreurs de mise en forme, des erreurs d\u2019orthographe seront signal\u00e9es et probablement corrig\u00e9es. Le plagiat sera d\u00e9couvert et la paternit\u00e9 de leur travail remise en cause. Il y a l\u00e0 une exigence qui s\u2019ajoute \u00e0 celle de l\u2019enseignant et qui, \u00e0 bien des \u00e9gards, para\u00eet davantage imp\u00e9rative. En fait, l\u2019\u00e9l\u00e8ve ne travaille plus jamais seul. On l\u2019a vu, le num\u00e9rique n\u2019est pas une invitation \u00e0 se replier sur soi et sa machine. Il travaille avec les autres. Il apprend \u00e0 d\u00e9l\u00e9guer, \u00e0 s\u2019organiser, \u00e0 faire confiance aux autres, \u00e0 responsabiliser le r\u00e9fractaire, \u00e0 demander de l\u2019aide aux autres. C\u2019est en cela que la disposition en U susmentionn\u00e9e au d\u00e9but de ce livre est un non-sens. Pourquoi r\u00e9unir des enfants dans une classe si c\u2019est pour les faire travailler s\u00e9par\u00e9ment ? Et ce n\u2019est pas toujours facile. En r\u00e9unissant des \u00e9l\u00e8ves par groupe, on prend conscience de leur difficult\u00e9 \u00e0 travailler ensemble, \u00e0 accepter les remarques ou \u00e0 temp\u00e9rer l\u2019autorit\u00e9 de tel \u00e9l\u00e8ve ou \u00e0 dynamiser tel autre \u00e9l\u00e8ve passif et soumis \u00e0 toute proposition (ou plut\u00f4t imposition) du voisin. Il faut donc inciter l\u2019\u00e9l\u00e8ve \u00e0 aller vers l\u2019autre. Il doit participer \u00e0 diff\u00e9rents projets que seul le num\u00e9rique a rendus possibles : il cr\u00e9e une web radio, une web TV, des podcasts, etc. Il interviewe des enseignants, des sportifs, des artistes et mobilise de nombreuses comp\u00e9tences pour arriver \u00e0 ses fins. Il sait enregistrer, travailler le son, utiliser des bruitages et agr\u00e9menter son travail d\u2019une musique. C\u2019est pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment ce que l\u2019on peut faire en enregistrant des audiobooks. C\u2019est un bel exemple de travail collaboratif. C\u2019est un plaisir que de voir les \u00e9l\u00e8ves r\u00e9unis autour d\u2019une table, autour d\u2019un projet commun et qui travaillent d\u2019arrache-pied \u00e0 la r\u00e9alisation de leur livre audio. Je n\u2019ai jamais vu autant de photocopies annot\u00e9es et dont le texte est soulign\u00e9, surlign\u00e9, entour\u00e9 afin d\u2019indiquer qui lit quoi et comment. Une fois encore, le num\u00e9rique permet de mieux faire passer des imp\u00e9ratifs scolaires. On peut exiger d\u2019un \u00e9l\u00e8ve qui lise et relire encore tel ou tel passage pour qu\u2019il lise mieux, plus fort, en articulant davantage et en mettant le ton. Mais c\u2019est parfois compliqu\u00e9 d\u2019obtenir un r\u00e9sultat. Il y a des fois un peu de mauvaise volont\u00e9 due \u00e0 une absence de motivation. Enregistrer des livres audio permet de cr\u00e9er cette motivation. On lit pour quelqu\u2019un (car l\u2019un des objectifs est de partager le travail sur SoundCloud) et ce travail \u00e9tant enregistr\u00e9 (et s\u2019inscrivant donc dans la dur\u00e9e), la plupart des \u00e9l\u00e8ves sont soucieux de bien faire et r\u00e9clament d\u2019eux-m\u00eames qu\u2019on recommence tel enregistrement parce qu\u2019il n\u2019est pas r\u00e9ussi ou pas assez convaincant \u00e0 leur avis. Il y a d\u2019ailleurs un travail remarquable \u00e0 effectuer de prime abord : celui de donner assez de confiance aux \u00e9l\u00e8ves pour qu\u2019ils acceptent leur voix qu\u2019ils jugent quasi syst\u00e9matiquement peu appr\u00e9ciable. Mais quel plaisir ensuite de voir que leur travail est remarqu\u00e9, qu\u2019il a \u00e9t\u00e9 amplement \u00e9cout\u00e9, partag\u00e9 et m\u00eame diffus\u00e9 quand celui-ci faisait l\u2019objet d\u2019un article par un journaliste ! L\u2019\u00e9l\u00e8ve communique \u29eb Il est sur les r\u00e9seaux sociaux et sait que sa parole l\u2019engage. Il diffuse tous azimuts et conna\u00eet les moyens de le faire. De ce point de vue, il sait donc \u00e9crire et en sait suffisamment pour cr\u00e9er son propre blog. Mais il sait aussi user de tous les moyens que l\u2019on conna\u00eet : les QR codes, la r\u00e9alit\u00e9 augment\u00e9e n\u2019ont rien pour lui d\u2019in\u00e9dit. Son quotidien en est envahi et, comme chez Marie Souli\u00e9, les murs de sa classe parlent. Pourquoi l\u2019affiche resterait-elle une simple affiche ? Pourquoi celle-ci ne s\u2019enrichirait-elle pas d\u2019informations qu\u2019un smartphone pourrait convoquer ? Par exemple d\u2019un QR code renvoyant \u00e0 des exercices ou encore, par le biais de la r\u00e9alit\u00e9 augment\u00e9e, le cours qui a fait l\u2019objet d\u2019une vid\u00e9o (et que l\u2019on appelle le plus souvent une capsule) peut appara\u00eetre l\u00e0 aussi sur l\u2019affiche, par le truchement du smartphone. Ainsi l\u2019information est partout et l\u2019\u00e9l\u00e8ve contribue \u00e0 la transmettre, car c\u2019est lui-m\u00eame qui r\u00e9alise ces affiches qui lui permettent de mesurer la validit\u00e9 de ses acquis. C\u2019est un travail in\u00e9dit sur la m\u00e9morisation. C\u2019est un nouveau moyen d\u2019acc\u00e8s \u00e0 la connaissance. La Twict\u00e9e, cette dict\u00e9e sur Twitter, est \u00e0 ce propos un enjeu int\u00e9ressant. On fait d\u2019une pierre deux coups en enseignant aux enfants l\u2019orthographe tout en les enjoignant \u00e0 partager ce travail sur Twitter, \u00e0 aider les autres et \u00e0 prendre confiance en eux. Ils ont ainsi franchi des fronti\u00e8res, au sein m\u00eame de leur propre classe, puisque l\u2019on communique avec d\u2019autres classes aux quatre coins du globe. L\u2019utilisation d\u2019Edmodo donne un souffle nouveau aux bonnes vieilles correspondances et les \u00e9changes d\u2019un continent \u00e0 l\u2019autre sont devenus monnaie courante. L\u2019univers de nos \u00e9l\u00e8ves n\u2019est plus la classe, c\u2019est la plan\u00e8te tout enti\u00e8re. Avec sa photo de profil (sa PP comme on dit), il se pr\u00e9sente par-del\u00e0 les mers. Mais il ne communique pas seulement, il transmet ses connaissances aux \u00e9l\u00e8ves de primaire comme peuvent le faire, par exemple, les \u00e9l\u00e8ves de Julia Dumont, professeur et r\u00e9f\u00e9rent num\u00e9rique de son \u00e9tablissement. Les \u00e9l\u00e8ves de 5e de Julia Dumont et de ses coll\u00e8gues ont cr\u00e9\u00e9 des ressources num\u00e9riques \u00e0 destination des \u00e9l\u00e8ves de primaire pour les accompagner dans leurs apprentissages. Ils r\u00e9investissent ce qu\u2019ils voient en classe et partagent leurs connaissances par le num\u00e9rique. Ainsi, en d\u00e9but d\u2019ann\u00e9e, quand ils n\u2019avaient pas encore de tablettes, les \u00e9l\u00e8ves ont cr\u00e9\u00e9 des questionnaires plickers pour les CM2. Puis quand ils les ont re\u00e7ues, ils ont eu l\u2019id\u00e9e de leur faire r\u00e9aliser des tutoriels sur le filtrage de l\u2019eau. Ceux-ci ont r\u00e9investi l\u2019exp\u00e9rience de d\u00e9cantation et de filtrage de l\u2019eau qui est au programme de 5e. Ils se mettent par groupes, refont l\u2019exp\u00e9rience vue en classe avec leur professeur et prennent de nombreuses photos. Ils les trient ensuite, les annotent, et r\u00e9alisent un tutoriel avec l\u2019application BookCreator (1 tutoriel par groupe). Le tutoriel termin\u00e9, ils \u00e9tablissent collectivement une grille d\u2019\u00e9valuation et reprennent si besoin leur tutoriel en fonction de celle-ci. Les \u00e9l\u00e8ves de primaire viennent ensuite au coll\u00e8ge pour r\u00e9aliser l\u2019exp\u00e9rience eux-m\u00eames. Ils sont r\u00e9partis par groupe et ont pour seule aide l\u2019un des tutos des 5e. Ils doivent refaire l\u2019exp\u00e9rience \u00e9tape par \u00e9tape et de pr\u00e9f\u00e9rence la r\u00e9ussir. Les auteurs du tutoriel qu\u2019ils ont en main les suivent \u00e0 distance pendant ce temps et constatent ou non les failles de leur travail : les \u00e9l\u00e8ves du primaire arrivent-ils \u00e0 bien s\u00e9lectionner, \u00e0 utiliser le mat\u00e9riel ? Ont-ils bien toutes les \u00e9tapes ? Je trouve le projet du coll\u00e8ge Albert Camus \u00e0 Bayonne absolument extraordinaire. Ce projet et celui de Julia Dumont repr\u00e9sentent \u00e0 mes yeux ce que le num\u00e9rique peut produire de meilleur. Dans le cas des enseignants du coll\u00e8ge Albert Camus, il s\u2019agit de r\u00e9aliser des audioguides pour le coll\u00e8ge \u00e0 destination des nouveaux \u00e9l\u00e8ves de 6e ainsi que des familles qui d\u00e9couvriront ainsi l\u2019\u00e9tablissement. Ce n\u2019est rien moins qu\u2019une visite virtuelle qui est propos\u00e9e, un peu comme celles que l\u2019on trouve dans les mus\u00e9es. Vous avez d\u00e9j\u00e0 probablement visit\u00e9 une exposition avec un casque sur les oreilles et suivi des explications audio concernant le tableau que vous regardiez. C\u2019est le m\u00eame principe. Les \u00e9l\u00e8ves ont utilis\u00e9 l\u2019application izi-TRAVEL. Il a fallu \u00e9crire les textes pr\u00e9sentant les b\u00e2timents et les enregistrer. Des QR codes ont \u00e9t\u00e9 cr\u00e9\u00e9s, appos\u00e9s sur chaque b\u00e2timent et ces derniers, une fois lus avec un t\u00e9l\u00e9phone, vous am\u00e8nent \u00e0 l\u2019application et donc la visite virtuelle contenant les photos, la g\u00e9olocalisation, les explications, etc. Ce qui fait la richesse du projet, c\u2019est que celui-ci est interdisciplinaire. L\u2019\u00e9tablissement ayant une population d\u2019\u00e9l\u00e8ves de diverses origines, les enseignants ont eu l\u2019id\u00e9e d\u2019associer les professeurs de langue afin de r\u00e9aliser les audioguides en plusieurs langues (anglais, espagnol). Des parents ont m\u00eame accept\u00e9 de traduire dans d\u2019autres langues comme le turc. Ainsi personne n\u2019\u00e9tait laiss\u00e9 de c\u00f4t\u00e9 en raison de ses capacit\u00e9s linguistiques. L\u2019\u00e9ducation aux m\u00e9dias \u00e9tait une \u00e9vidence dans tout projet de ce type puisqu\u2019il faut montrer aux \u00e9l\u00e8ves que l\u2019on ne saurait utiliser telle image ou telle musique sans s\u2019acquitter de droits parfois on\u00e9reux. Pour r\u00e9aliser les photographies, les \u00e9l\u00e8ves ont eu l\u2019autorisation d\u2019utiliser leur t\u00e9l\u00e9phone. C\u2019est donc un travail sur le texte, le son, l\u2019image. Par ces exemples, on voit que l\u2019\u00e9crit n\u2019est pas la seule comp\u00e9tence \u00e0 d\u00e9velopper chez l\u2019\u00e9l\u00e8ve, m\u00eame si c\u2019est quelque chose d\u2019extr\u00eamement important. Le travail sur le son montre l\u2019importance de l'oral qui est souvent une activit\u00e9 n\u00e9glig\u00e9e, qui est en tout cas plac\u00e9e en dessous de l'\u00e9crit. C\u2019est un peu, en fran\u00e7ais, l\u2019\u00e9quivalent de la ponctuation (et ne parlons m\u00eame pas de la typographie). On est tous convaincu que son enseignement est absolument important, mais on se consacre \u00e0 des choses plus visibles, la grammaire ou l\u2019orthographe. Or, on vient de le voir, l\u2019\u00e9cole est le royaume de l\u2019\u00e9crit. La plupart des examens (du moins au coll\u00e8ge), des notes sont li\u00e9s \u00e0 l'\u00e9crit. La l\u00e9gitimit\u00e9 de l'oral peut se retrouver par le num\u00e9rique : les tout-petits (voir plus haut l\u2019exemple de Puppet Pals HD) comme les plus grands (cf. les audiobooks, les \u00e9l\u00e8ves film\u00e9s pour r\u00e9aliser les fiches de lecture avec la r\u00e9alit\u00e9 augment\u00e9e ou pour se pr\u00e9senter...). Les activit\u00e9s li\u00e9es \u00e0 l\u2019oral pourraient cependant \u00eatre qualifi\u00e9es d\u2019oral r\u00e9dig\u00e9 : le th\u00e9\u00e2tre, la t\u00e9l\u00e9vision, les interviews pour une \u00e9mission de radio\u2026 Ces derni\u00e8res sont tr\u00e8s int\u00e9ressantes \u00e0 observer. Quand les \u00e9l\u00e8ves se lancent dans ce genre d\u2019activit\u00e9, ils ont tendance \u00e0 privil\u00e9gier des questions ferm\u00e9es limitant les possibilit\u00e9s de la conversation. Ils ont aussi tendance \u00e0 accueillir la r\u00e9ponse de l\u2019autre comme une fin de non-recevoir. C\u2019est comme si ce que disait l\u2019autre ne pouvait \u00eatre accueilli que dans l\u2019acceptation totale. Il a \u00e9t\u00e9 dit ceci ou cela, et les \u00e9l\u00e8ves ont peu l\u2019habitude de demander des d\u00e9tails suppl\u00e9mentaires, des pr\u00e9cisions. Ils n\u2019osent tout simplement pas dire qu\u2019ils n\u2019ont pas compris. Il est une autre activit\u00e9 que j\u2019aimerais mettre en place, le \u00ab talk \u00bb. Un \u00e9l\u00e8ve, sur un sujet de son choix, doit pr\u00e9senter en cinq minutes \u00e0 l'aide d'un PowerPoint une anecdote, une activit\u00e9, un domaine du programme, un voyage, etc. Il s\u2019agit de l\u2019inviter \u00e0 se mettre en avant, \u00e0 exposer ce pour quoi il se passionne voire \u00e0 admettre l\u2019opinion d\u2019autrui sur ce qu\u2019il a de plus cher. Le maniement d\u2019un logiciel du type PowerPoint ne serait pas superf\u00e9tatoire. Combien d\u2019adultes ignorent les rudiments de son usage ! Et comment en serait-il autrement ? Personne ne leur a appris \u00e0 s\u2019en servir ! Il me semble que cette activit\u00e9 de communication pourrait avoir une autre vertu. Des \u00e9l\u00e8ves ne peuvent pratiquer une activit\u00e9 sportive ? Pourquoi pas ne pas recourir \u00e0 ces \u00e9l\u00e8ves pour qu\u2019ils participent, comme ces \u00e9l\u00e8ves qui, lors du cross, vont interviewer les participants ? Pourquoi diable des \u00e9l\u00e8ves dispens\u00e9s de telle activit\u00e9 seraient r\u00e9duits \u00e0 l\u2019inactivit\u00e9 totale ? Le num\u00e9rique \u00e9tant \u00e9minemment socialisant, l\u2019\u00e9l\u00e8ve communique, partage ses connaissances, soutient l\u2019\u00e9l\u00e8ve en difficult\u00e9. Il partage donc ses comp\u00e9tences. De la m\u00eame fa\u00e7on, l\u2019enseignant communique avec la famille : s\u2019\u00e9crire ou m\u00eame se parler \u00e9vacue les difficult\u00e9s, les doutes, les errements. Pour ma part, je pr\u00e9f\u00e8re que l\u2019on m\u2019\u00e9crive, chez moi, \u00e0 l\u2019heure que l\u2019on veut, plut\u00f4t que de trouver le lendemain matin un \u00e9l\u00e8ve dont le d\u00e9sarroi d\u00e9coule de son incapacit\u00e9 \u00e0 avoir fait son travail. Ainsi, on accompagne les \u00e9l\u00e8ves que personne ne peut aider \u00e0 la maison. Enfin un peu de justice dans l\u2019enfer dominical des devoirs ! Au reste, comme mes cours sont directement tap\u00e9s sur mon iPad et vid\u00e9oprojet\u00e9s, il m\u2019est tr\u00e8s facile de les envoyer par mail (mais on verra plus bas qu\u2019il y a encore plus simple). Je pourrais m\u00eame filmer le cours, et le transmettre aux absents. L\u2019\u00e9l\u00e8ve manipule l\u2019image \u29eb L\u2019\u00e9l\u00e8ve a acquis une comp\u00e9tence en la mati\u00e8re qui force l\u2019\u00e9tonnement. Via Instagram ou Snapchat, il cadre et applique des filtres autrefois r\u00e9serv\u00e9s \u00e0 quelques happy few (souvenez-vous de la d\u00e9claration du fondateur d\u2019Instagram : \u00ab All Instagram did was take the creative tools that the pros have been using and put them in the hands of the masses \u00bb). Cette d\u00e9mocratisation des usages en rappelle une autre. Souvenons-nous du slogan de Kodak et de son appareil photographique commercialis\u00e9 en 1888 : \u00ab You Press the Button, We Do the Rest ! \u00bb. L'\u00e9l\u00e8ve sait souligner les d\u00e9tails et enregistrer la fr\u00eale beaut\u00e9 d\u2019un moment qui agr\u00e9mente reportages, expos\u00e9s ou tutoriels, notamment lors de sorties scolaires. Il manipule all\u00e8grement Canva ou Post d'Adobe pour illustrer tout ce qui doit l'\u00eatre et cr\u00e9er des banni\u00e8res et des logos (comme pour notre radio ou notre future cha\u00eene de t\u00e9l\u00e9). Comme ce professeur de philosophie, l\u2019\u00e9l\u00e8ve peut se saisir d\u2019Instagram comme d\u2019une contrainte fructueuse pour d\u00e9finir une notion avec concision ou prodiguer un conseil. On peut m\u00eame se demander si le num\u00e9rique ne permet pas tout simplement d\u2019acc\u00e9der \u00e0 la beaut\u00e9 artistique. Vous qui \u00eates n\u00e9 dans les ann\u00e9es 70 ou 80, vous \u00eates-vous d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9merveill\u00e9, \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9cole, de la splendeur de tel tableau ? De tel manuscrit enferm\u00e9 dans les coffres-forts de la BNF ? De tel film en haute d\u00e9finition ? Eh bien ! non, puisque vous n\u2019aviez que cette photocopie en noir et blanc ou cette t\u00e9l\u00e9 \u00e0 tube cathodique juch\u00e9e sur l\u2019armoire du coin de la classe ! Quant aux merveilles de la BNF, vous n\u2019y aviez simplement pas acc\u00e8s. L\u2019\u00e9l\u00e8ve devrait savoir produire un bon mash-up capable de susciter le rire sur des questions d\u2019actualit\u00e9 (et \u00e0 ce propos, la semaine de la presse devrait \u00eatre\u2026 annuelle). Il use \u00e0 foison des gifs anim\u00e9s qui sont devenus \u00e9galement un moyen de communication. Certaines vid\u00e9os, montages, gifs anim\u00e9s sont m\u00eame des invitations \u00e0 repenser notre rapport \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9l\u00e8ve ou \u00e0 notre p\u00e9dagogie\u2026 Parcourez les Timelines de vos \u00e9l\u00e8ves, et vous serez surpris de voir combien de le\u00e7ons dr\u00f4les et d\u00e9cal\u00e9es vous recevriez (en toute humilit\u00e9 cela va sans dire). L\u2019\u00e9l\u00e8ve produit ses propres tutoriels sur YouTube (voir ces vid\u00e9os sur l\u2019utilisation de Scratch ou encore le travail des \u00e9l\u00e8ves de Na\u00efma Horchani Carton). J'avais beaucoup aim\u00e9 voir les jeunes \u00e9l\u00e8ves de Fran\u00e7ois Lamoureux se saisir de leur tablette pour expliquer ce qu'est un triangle \u00e9quilat\u00e9ral ou un polygone. Le recours au fond vert d\u00e9cuple les possibilit\u00e9s : mettre en sc\u00e8ne une fiction plus vraie que nature est chose possible. En fran\u00e7ais, nous l'utilisons pour adapter des fables de La Fontaine afin d'en faire des sayn\u00e8tes. L\u2019\u00e9l\u00e8ve sait donc ce qu\u2019est un logiciel de montage vid\u00e9o et conna\u00eet diff\u00e9rents formats (et pas seulement du .wma ou de l\u2019.avi). Mais pour faire de la vid\u00e9o, combien il est important de persuader ces jeunes \u00e9l\u00e8ves qu\u2019il faut accepter sa voix et son corps, qu\u2019il faut accepter de se mettre en avant, face \u00e0 une cam\u00e9ra. Que de comp\u00e9tences sont ainsi \u00e0 cr\u00e9er ! Rien que pour faire une vid\u00e9o en classe, il faut acqu\u00e9rir les connaissances, organiser ses id\u00e9es, \u00e9crire le script, (se) filmer, monter le film puis diffuser et partager. Les professeurs d\u2019art plastique s\u2019en donnent d\u2019ailleurs \u00e0 c\u0153ur joie et combien d\u2019ateliers vid\u00e9o pr\u00e9parant \u00e0 la section audiovisuelle au lyc\u00e9e peut-on trouver ! En parcourant le travail de ces \u00e9l\u00e8ves et de leur enseignant, on voit que toute l\u2019histoire du cin\u00e9ma se retrouve dans leurs productions : depuis le cin\u00e9ma muet et ses sauts dans des sacs de patates jusqu\u2019aux sketchs plus sophistiqu\u00e9s o\u00f9 se retrouvent Stop Motion ou pixilation. L\u2019\u00e9l\u00e8ve est un chercheur \u29eb Avant, le travail de l\u2019\u00e9l\u00e8ve \u00e9tait d\u2019apprendre \u00e0 lire, puis de lire tout ce qui lui \u00e9tait soumis. C\u2019\u00e9tait on ne peut plus simple. Dor\u00e9navant, l\u2019\u00e9l\u00e8ve doit \u00e9galement apprendre \u00e0 interroger la validit\u00e9 de ce qui lui est soumis. Il doit apprendre \u00e0 ne pas se satisfaire des premiers r\u00e9sultats propos\u00e9s par Google. Bien souvent, il doit apprendre \u00e0 discerner que ce qui s\u2019offre \u00e0 son regard n\u2019est que publicit\u00e9 et que le lien sur lequel il vient de cliquer et qui ne s\u2019avoue pas comme tel n\u2019est que publireportage. Il doit apprendre \u00e0 ne pas se fier \u00e0 toutes les affirmations reprises ici ou l\u00e0 sans v\u00e9rification aucune. Il doit croiser les sources et d\u00e9passer les deux premi\u00e8res pages de r\u00e9sultats affich\u00e9es par le moteur de recherche. L\u2019\u00e9l\u00e8ve est donc un infatigable chercheur et il conna\u00eet les techniques li\u00e9es \u00e0 une bonne et efficace recherche. Il sait utiliser non pas un mais plusieurs moteurs de recherche : Google bien s\u00fbr, mais aussi et peut-\u00eatre surtout Duck Duck Go, Qwant ou Quant Junior, etc. Il sait affiner sa recherche en recourant \u00e0 tous les outils mis \u00e0 sa disposition, que ce soit en s\u00e9lectionnant telle ou telle option (ainsi dans Google, l\u2019option Outils de recherche lui permet d\u2019op\u00e9rer quelques s\u00e9lections comme les droits d\u2019usage, ce qui suppose qu\u2019il a \u00e9t\u00e9 initi\u00e9 aux licences Creative Commons) mais aussi en recourant \u00e0 quelques \u00e9l\u00e9ments comme des op\u00e9rateurs bool\u00e9ens (tels AND, OR ou NOT). Et l\u2019\u00e9l\u00e8ve ne s\u2019\u00e9tonne pas de tout ce que l\u2019on peut trouver \u00e0 l\u2019aide d\u2019un simple crtl + f ! Le travail \u00e0 r\u00e9aliser est titanesque, car il n\u2019a en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral pas \u00e9t\u00e9 fait. Il a pu faire l\u2019objet d\u2019une ou quelques s\u00e9ances au CDI, mais c\u2019est un travail qui devrait \u00eatre renouvel\u00e9 tout au long de la scolarit\u00e9 voire pratiqu\u00e9 r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement. Faites l\u2019essai avec vos \u00e9l\u00e8ves. Demandez-leur ce qu\u2019est un navigateur (vous pouvez m\u00eame tenter de leur faire trouver le mot tout seul, ce qui peut \u00eatre fort long), demandez-leur ce qu\u2019est un moteur de recherche, demandez-leur de vous en donner au moins cinq, demandez-leur pourquoi selon eux il faudrait multiplier l\u2019usage de moteurs de recherche au lieu de se contenter d\u2019un seul, demandez-leur s\u2019ils savent pourquoi tel r\u00e9sultat appara\u00eet en premier et non \u00e0 la page 12, demandez-leur s\u2019ils savent comment la publicit\u00e9 appara\u00eet dans les r\u00e9sultats, et vous verrez que ces usagers quotidiens du web savent tr\u00e8s peu de choses. Ce qui est doublement f\u00e2cheux, car non seulement les enseignants se sont montr\u00e9s insuffisamment soucieux de d\u00e9velopper des comp\u00e9tences de recherche, mais en plus l\u2019activit\u00e9 de la lecture, on l\u2019a vu, est beaucoup plus complexe qu\u2019auparavant. Le jeune lecteur des ann\u00e9es 90 pouvait se contenter d\u2019apprendre \u00e0 lire, aujourd\u2019hui, notre lecteur doit en plus d\u00e9terminer la validit\u00e9 de l\u2019information. Il doit donc aussi remonter \u00e0 la source d\u2019une info, d\u2019une image et ne s\u2019en laisse pas compter par toutes les rumeurs, qui pullulent \u00e0 chaque \u00e9v\u00e9nement d\u2019importance, comme ce fut le cas pour les attentats de janvier puis de novembre 2015. Il faut bien reconna\u00eetre que l\u2019\u00e9l\u00e8ve est noy\u00e9 dans un flux d\u2019informations dont un grand nombre sont fausses et archifausses. Et le faux ne semble conna\u00eetre aucune limite, comme en t\u00e9moigne cet article de Num\u00e9rama o\u00f9 l'on d\u00e9couvre que l'assaut de la cr\u00e9dulit\u00e9 ne conna\u00eet lui non plus aucune limite. Que l\u2019on songe \u00e9galement aux fausses photos qui circulent \u00e0 chaque \u00e9v\u00e9nement majeur. Lors des attentats, on pr\u00e9tendait que d\u2019autres avaient lieu en m\u00eame temps. Plus vieux, mais tout aussi int\u00e9ressants, lors d\u2019inondations en Australie, certains articles n\u2019h\u00e9sitaient pas \u00e0 pr\u00e9tendre que des requins circulaient dans les rues inond\u00e9es. Songez encore au terrorisme, aux illuminatis ou aux nombreuses th\u00e9ories du complot remettant en question tout et n\u2019importe quoi, et vous en arriverez \u00e0 la m\u00eame conclusion. L\u2019\u00e9ducation aux m\u00e9dias est cruciale. Dans un tel contexte, le CLEMI fait un travail remarquable et fournit de nombreux dossiers \u00e0 l\u2019attention des \u00e9l\u00e8ves. L\u2019\u00e9l\u00e8ve sait qu\u2019il a une responsabilit\u00e9, une responsabilit\u00e9 d\u2019autant plus grande qu\u2019il est conscient des abus li\u00e9s au droit d\u2019auteur. Mais de la m\u00eame fa\u00e7on qu\u2019il partage, il est sensible \u00e0 la culture du libre, des notions de standard, d\u2019honn\u00eatet\u00e9 et de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 intellectuelle. Si celle-ci est inali\u00e9nable, il est conscient qu\u2019un enjeu plus vaste le d\u00e9passe et contribue \u00e0 l\u2019enrichissement du bien commun. Il sait donc ce que signifient les Creative Commons et sait utiliser le travail des autres sans se livrer \u00e0 un pillage que d\u2019aucuns ne manqueraient pas de lui reprocher. L\u2019\u00e9l\u00e8ve sait que ce qu\u2019il \u00e9crit sur Vikidia est lu, et remarqu\u00e9, comment\u00e9 et supprim\u00e9 s\u2019il contrevient aux r\u00e8gles. Il sait que le plagiat est une bien vilaine chose. L\u2019\u00e9l\u00e8ve est autonome \u29eb ^c4e92e Sugata Mitra est un homme passionnant. Si vous ne l\u2019avez jamais \u00e9cout\u00e9, pr\u00e9cipitez-vous sur votre ordinateur et voyez ces trois conf\u00e9rences. Ce chercheur s\u2019int\u00e9resse aux questions d\u2019\u00e9ducation, particuli\u00e8rement dans les milieux d\u00e9favoris\u00e9s. Il a men\u00e9 sa premi\u00e8re exp\u00e9rience \u00e0 New Delhi en 1999. The hole in the wall. L\u2019id\u00e9e consistait \u00e0 donner un acc\u00e8s \u00e0 un ordinateur et \u00e0 internet \u00e0 des enfants qui, de surcroit, ne parlaient pas anglais. \u00c0 cette \u00e9poque, Sugata Mitra avait un bureau \u00e0 c\u00f4t\u00e9 d\u2019un bidonville. Un mur s\u00e9parait son bureau de ce quartier. Il y avait un trou dans ce mur (d\u2019o\u00f9 le nom de l\u2019exp\u00e9rience). Un PC et un touchpad ont \u00e9t\u00e9 encastr\u00e9s dans ce trou avec une bonne connexion internet. Huit heures apr\u00e8s, un petit gar\u00e7on de huit apprenait \u00e0 une fillette de six ans qui se dressait sur la pointe des pieds comment naviguer sur internet. Chose amusante, l\u2019anglais ne semblait pas poser de probl\u00e8me \u00e0 ces enfants. Quelqu\u2019un le leur avait-il appris ? Quelqu\u2019un avait-il aid\u00e9 ces enfants ? Afin de trouver une r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 ces questions, Sugata Mitra renouvelle l\u2019exp\u00e9rience \u00e0 Shivpuri, une ville du centre de l\u2019Inde dans laquelle, s\u2019amuse le chercheur, personne n\u2019avait appris quoi que ce soit \u00e0 qui que ce soit\u2026 Il s'est pass\u00e9 la m\u00eame chose qu'\u00e0 New Delhi. L\u2019exp\u00e9rience s'est poursuivie dans le nord-est de l\u2019Inde dans un village, Madantusi, o\u00f9 il n\u2019y avait pas de professeur d\u2019anglais. Les enfants n\u2019avaient donc jamais appris l\u2019anglais. De plus, dans ce village, il n\u2019y avait pas de connexion possible \u00e0 internet. Sugata Mitra a donc mis un ordinateur et quelques CD. Il est revenu trois mois plus tard. Deux enfants \u00e9taient en train de jouer \u00e0 un jeu et se sont exclam\u00e9s : \u00ab On a besoin d\u2019une nouvelle souris et d\u2019un processeur plus puissant. \u00bb Devant la surprise du chercheur qui se demandait comment les enfants pouvaient savoir cela, ceux-ci ont expliqu\u00e9, avec une pointe d\u2019agacement, que puisque l\u2019ordinateur \u00e9tait en anglais, ils avaient d\u00fb apprendre l\u2019anglais. Mais l\u2019exp\u00e9rience la plus fascinante et la plus amusante est celle o\u00f9 Sugata Mitra s\u2019est demand\u00e9 si des enfants pouvaient apprendre par eux-m\u00eames la biotechnologie et naturellement en anglais. Il a dit \u00e0 26 enfants qu\u2019il y avait des choses tr\u00e8s compliqu\u00e9es dans l\u2019ordinateur qu\u2019il leur confiait et que ce ne serait pas \u00e9tonnant s'ils ne comprenaient absolument rien \u00e0 rien, que tout \u00e9tait en anglais et a conclu : \u00ab Je vous laisse \u00bb. Il est revenu deux mois apr\u00e8s et a demand\u00e9 aux enfants s\u2019ils avaient jet\u00e9 un \u0153il sur les choses qu\u2019il y avait sur l\u2019ordinateur : \u00ab Oui. \u2014 Avez-vous compris quelque chose ? \u2014 Non, rien du tout. \u2014 Combien de temps vous \u00eates-vous entra\u00een\u00e9s avant de d\u00e9clarer que vous ne compreniez rien ? \u2014 On a regard\u00e9 tous les jours. \u2014 Pendant deux mois, vous avez regard\u00e9 des trucs que vous ne compreniez pas ? \u2014 Litt\u00e9ralement. \u00c0 part le fait qu\u2019une mauvaise reproduction de la mol\u00e9cule d\u2019ADN est la cause de maladies g\u00e9n\u00e9tiques, on n\u2019a rien compris d\u2019autre. \u00bb Le score obtenu par la jeune fille qui a fait cette r\u00e9ponse au chercheur \u00e9tait de 30%, ce qui est bien mais malheureusement insuffisant. Sugata Mitra a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 une autre fille, une amie plus \u00e2g\u00e9e de l\u2019enfant, si elle acceptait d\u2019enseigner la biotechnologie afin que l'enfant soit re\u00e7ue \u00e0 l\u2019examen en obtenant 50%. Elle a r\u00e9pondu qu\u2019elle ne le pourrait pas puisqu\u2019elle ne connaissait rien \u00e0 la biotechnologie. Sugata Mitra a r\u00e9torqu\u00e9 qu\u2019elle n\u2019aurait qu\u2019\u00e0 utiliser la m\u00e9thode de la grand-m\u00e8re\u2026 \u00ab Qu\u2019est-ce que c\u2019est ? \u00bb s\u2019est-elle exclam\u00e9e. En fait, tout ce qu\u2019il faut faire c\u2019est se tenir derri\u00e8re l\u2019enfant et l\u2019admirer tout le temps, juste lui dire : \u00ab C\u2019est bien, c\u2019est fantastique. Qu\u2019est-ce que c\u2019est ? Peux-tu m\u2019en montrer davantage ? \u00bb Elle a fait \u00e7a pendant deux mois. Les r\u00e9sultats de la jeune fille sont pass\u00e9s de 30 \u00e0 50%, ce qui correspond au niveau attendu d\u2019un \u00e9l\u00e8ve recevant un enseignement en biotechnologie. On peut donc parier sur l\u2019autonomie des enfants. Pour cr\u00e9er l\u2019\u00e9mulation tant n\u00e9cessaire au processus d\u2019apprentissage, la m\u00e9thode de la grand-m\u00e8re est une invitation \u00e0 poursuivre les efforts, des efforts que les enfants font d\u2019eux-m\u00eames si leur curiosit\u00e9 a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9veill\u00e9e. Tout ce que l\u2019enseignant a eu \u00e0 faire a \u00e9t\u00e9 de mettre en place les conditions de mise en \u0153uvre du travail \u00e0 effectuer. Une enseignante m\u2019avait dit un jour : \u00ab En classe, je ne travaille pas. Je travaille avant, je travaille apr\u00e8s mais, pendant, ce sont les \u00e9l\u00e8ves qui travaillent \u00bb. C\u2019est ce que j\u2019appelle l\u2019autonomie. Une autonomie toute relative puisqu\u2019elle se d\u00e9roule sous les auspices bienveillants du professeur, mais aussi parce que les \u00e9l\u00e8ves travaillent en groupe et trouvent du r\u00e9confort dans l\u2019aide de leurs pairs. Soumettez-leur toutes sortes de probl\u00e8mes et ils les r\u00e9soudront seuls. \u00ab Si une m\u00e9t\u00e9orite se dirigeait vers la terre, comment ferais-tu pour savoir si elle va toucher la terre ou pas ? \u00bb Devant la perplexit\u00e9 de l\u2019enfant, Sugata Mitra, sugg\u00e8re le mot magique : \u00ab tangente \u00bb. Et c\u2019est tout. L\u2019enfant fera le reste. C\u2019est tout le sens de son programme SOLE (sefl organized learning environment). Naturellement, c'est une conception tout \u00e0 fait particuli\u00e8re de l'enseignement, mais une conception qui doit nous inciter \u00e0 r\u00e9fl\u00e9chir \u00e0 la place et au r\u00f4le des uns et des autres. Il ne s\u2019agit donc pas de laisser l\u2019enfant se d\u00e9brouiller seul, ce qui serait une d\u00e9finition de l\u2019autonomie qui mettrait \u00e0 mal le r\u00f4le de l\u2019\u00e9cole. Cette solitude est celle de l\u2019\u00e9tudiant qui doit suivre un MOOC, processus qui, comme l\u2019\u00e9crivent Andr\u00e9 Tricot et Franck Amadou, s\u2019av\u00e8re tr\u00e8s exigeant dans le sens o\u00f9 l\u2019accompagnement est plus faible que lors d\u2019un cours en pr\u00e9sentiel. \u00ab Pour \u00eatre autonome, il faut donc en avoir les moyens \u00bb \u00e9crivent les deux enseignants. Savoir quoi \u00e9tudier, quelles ressources consulter, quelles activit\u00e9s mener, quand et comment, g\u00e9rer son temps sont des comp\u00e9tences complexes. L\u2019autonomie que j\u2019appelle de mes v\u0153ux ne consiste pas \u00e0 attendre de nos petits \u00e9l\u00e8ves qu\u2019ils fassent tout tous seuls, mais bien que toutes les conditions soient r\u00e9unies pour qu\u2019ils produisent un travail riche et extr\u00eamement motivant. L\u2019an dernier, \u00e0 la demande de mon coll\u00e8gue d\u2019\u00e9ducation musicale, j\u2019avais accept\u00e9 d\u2019accompagner l\u2019orchestre et la chorale du coll\u00e8ge \u00e0 la guitare. Je suis donc venu \u00e0 quelques r\u00e9p\u00e9titions puis le soir du spectacle, nous avons jou\u00e9 les morceaux pr\u00e9vus (et choisis par les \u00e9l\u00e8ves eux-m\u00eames). Quelle ne fut pas ma surprise, \u00e0 la fin du spectacle, de voir les \u00e9l\u00e8ves qui venaient de saluer, se rassembler sur la sc\u00e8ne autour du piano ! Ils avaient pr\u00e9par\u00e9 un morceau suppl\u00e9mentaire, une sorte d\u2019hommage collectif au groupe et \u00e0 l\u2019enseignant qui avait organis\u00e9 tout cela. On ne peut pas ne pas en venir \u00e0 la conclusion que les enfants se passent fort bien de leurs ma\u00eetres. En faisant entrer le num\u00e9rique \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9cole (et en y laissant tout de m\u00eame le ma\u00eetre), l\u2019enseignement permet de diff\u00e9rencier la p\u00e9dagogie (l\u2019enseignant ne peut pas se d\u00e9multiplier, mais il peut confier aux \u00e9l\u00e8ves certaines t\u00e2ches \u00e0 r\u00e9aliser sur des ordinateurs ou des tablettes). En proc\u00e9dant ainsi, il d\u00e9gage du temps pour les plus d\u00e9munis. Et par l\u00e0 m\u00eame, il contraint les \u00e9l\u00e8ves \u00e0 devenir autonomes : ils doivent effectuer certains travaux et, tant que le professeur ne s\u2019est pas pench\u00e9 sur leur travail, celui-ci doit \u00eatre effectu\u00e9 avec la pr\u00e9cision et le s\u00e9rieux requis. De surcroit, les \u00e9l\u00e8ves apprennent \u00e0 rechercher l\u2019information, et non attendre qu\u2019on la leur donne. \u00c0 ce sujet, je trouve l'utilisation d'Aurasma en EPS permettant l'autonomie des \u00e9l\u00e8ves particuli\u00e8rement pertinente. Encore une fois, les affiches peuvent \u00eatre mises \u00e0 contribution pour indiquer aux \u00e9l\u00e8ves ce qu\u2019ils ont \u00e0 faire. Ainsi en braquant le t\u00e9l\u00e9phone ou la tablette sur l\u2019affiche, l\u2019\u00e9l\u00e8ve d\u00e9couvrira une vid\u00e9o lui indiquant l\u2019activit\u00e9 \u00e0 r\u00e9aliser. Quelque activit\u00e9 que l'on choisisse de mettre en place, le professeur cr\u00e9e les conditions du travail. Ce n'est pas \u00e0 lui de travailler face \u00e0 des \u00e9l\u00e8ves assis qui b\u00e2illent, mais aux \u00e9l\u00e8ves d'\u00eatre actifs. Dans ces conditions, l'enseignant est un animateur. Je choisis ce terme en raison de la connotation p\u00e9jorative que lui attribuent nombre de coll\u00e8gues qui, ce faisant, oublient que le mot \u00ab animateur \u00bb vient du latin \u00ab anima \u00bb et qu'il signifie l\u2019\u00e2me, l\u2019esprit L\u2019\u00e9l\u00e8ve publie \u29eb Savoir publier est un enjeu majeur. Il ne s\u2019agit rien moins que d\u2019apprendre \u00e0 faire entendre sa voix. Bien souvent ont \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9voqu\u00e9s les enjeux d\u2019une d\u00e9mocratie participative et on imagine mal des citoyens qui ne trouveraient nulle part o\u00f9 s\u2019exprimer. Il serait \u00e9galement fort regrettable que ces m\u00eames citoyens soient paralys\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019id\u00e9e de faire des fautes orthographes ou de commettre quelque maladresse. Les moyens techniques de faire ce qui n\u2019\u00e9tait autrefois r\u00e9serv\u00e9 qu\u2019\u00e0 quelques-uns sont un progr\u00e8s. Il ne faut donc en aucun cas que ce progr\u00e8s soit amoindri par une r\u00e9serve, une timidit\u00e9 lexicale ou syntaxique. L\u2019\u00e9cole a donc un r\u00f4le important \u00e0 jouer. Plus que jamais il importe que l\u2019on sache \u00e9crire et bien \u00e9crire. Il faut aussi savoir \u00e9crire. Pas seulement poss\u00e9der les comp\u00e9tences langagi\u00e8res ni stylistiques mais aussi savoir comment on va \u00e9crire sur le web. Ce probl\u00e8me se pose avec d\u2019autant plus d\u2019acuit\u00e9 que, comme la lecture qui se fait partout (liseuse, t\u00e9l\u00e9phone, ordinateur\u2026), l\u2019\u00e9criture et la publication peuvent conna\u00eetre un essor \u00e9galement prot\u00e9iforme. Pour ma part, j\u2019aime l\u2019id\u00e9e qu\u2019un texte quel qu\u2019il soit puisse instantan\u00e9ment \u00eatre publi\u00e9 sur mon blog, dans un ePub ou sur le r\u00e9seau social de mon choix (je pense, entre autres, \u00e0 Medium). C\u2019est en ce sens que le Markdown, ce \u00ab langage \u00bb de balisage est d\u2019une utilit\u00e9 toute particuli\u00e8re. Expliquons d\u00e9j\u00e0 de quoi il retourne. Comme le dit David Bosman : \u00ab je trouve \u00e7a toujours trop compliqu\u00e9 d\u2019expliquer en th\u00e9orie un truc qui est vraiment tout con en pratique [\u2026] \u00bb Mais essayons. L\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat du Markdown est de sauter une \u00e9tape. Au lieu d\u2019\u00e9crire un texte puis de le formater (mettre certains mots en gras, en italique, cr\u00e9er des liens, etc.) en ajoutant telle ou telle balise HTML, ce qui est souvent fastidieux, on \u00e9crit son texte tout en le formatant gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 un langage qui a le bon go\u00fbt de rester discret, de ne pas encombrer le texte et donc de permettre de sauter une \u00e9tape puisqu\u2019on publie imm\u00e9diatement apr\u00e8s l\u2019\u00e9criture du texte. De plus, c\u2019est facile \u00e0 apprendre. Voyons un exemple. Souvent, on \u00e9crit son texte, comme celui-ci : On peut aussi utiliser 1Writer ou Editorial. Et c\u2019est vraiment tr\u00e8s pratique ! Si on veut publier sur le web, on ajoute (ou on fait ajouter automatiquement par un logiciel) les balises HTML afin de mettre le texte en forme ou d'ajouter les liens, et mon exemple de texte donnerait ceci : <p>Pour cela, on peut aussi utiliser <a href=\"https://appsto.re/fr/GjYO.i\">1Writer</a> ou <a href=\"https://appsto.re/fr/UqWkO.i\">Editorial</a>.<br /> Et c'est vraiment <em>tr\u00e8s pratique</em> !</p> ```` Mais en Markdown, cela donnerait \u00e7a : ```html On peut aussi utiliser [1Writer](https://appsto.re/fr/GjYO.i) ou [Editorial](https://appsto.re/fr/UqWkO.i). Et c'est vraiment *tr\u00e8s pratique* ! C\u2019est plus \u00e9pur\u00e9 et on fait tout en une seule \u00e9tape. L\u2019\u00e9criture et la mise en forme. Votre WordPress saura afficher tout \u00e7a comme si c\u2019\u00e9tait du HTML. Pas convaincu ? Essayons avec un autre exemple. Vous avez d\u00e9j\u00e0 cr\u00e9\u00e9 une liste en HTML ? Rien de compliqu\u00e9 mais \u00e7a peut \u00eatre long\u2026 Encore une fois comparons HTML vs Markdown : HTML \u29eb <ul> <li>Daedalus</li> <li>1Writer</li> <li>Editorial</li> </ul> Markdown \u29eb - Daedalus - 1Writer - Editorial Il y a donc un gain de temps ind\u00e9niable et dans l\u2019\u00e9criture, la mise en forme et la publication puisque votre texte est pr\u00eat \u00e0 \u00eatre export\u00e9 en HTML ou en ePub. Cependant, le Markdown ne s\u2019oppose pas au HTML. Comme le dit un de ses auteurs, \u00ab HTML is a publishing format ; Markdown is a writing format \u00bb. Il me semble qu\u2019\u00e0 l\u2019heure o\u00f9 on parle beaucoup de code \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9cole, ce langage n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 tellement popularis\u00e9 dans le monde de l\u2019\u00c9ducation (pas tellement plus que le HTML d\u2019ailleurs). Les enseignants qui \u00e9crivent beaucoup ont tout int\u00e9r\u00eat \u00e0 adopter ces langages (si tant est qu\u2019on puisse vraiment parler de langage d\u2019ailleurs). Vous publiez beaucoup ? Vous \u00e9crivez pour votre blog ? Vous \u00e9crivez des livres ? Ou vous avez un Tumblr ? Le Markdown vous ferait gagner un temps pr\u00e9cieux. Vous \u00e9crivez une fois, vous publiez partout. Or un tel langage est extr\u00eamement simple \u00e0 apprendre. Pour des \u00e9l\u00e8ves qui ont d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 confront\u00e9s \u00e0 la syntaxe wiki, c\u2019est m\u00eame un jeu d\u2019enfant. Si vous estimez que vos \u00e9l\u00e8ves n\u2019ont ni besoin d\u2019\u00e9crire des livres, ni de tenir un blog ou un Tumblr, mais que vous souhaitez tout de m\u00eame qu\u2019ils aient une audience, peut-\u00eatre souhaiterez-vous les confronter \u00e0 l\u2019usage des r\u00e9seaux sociaux. En ce qui me concerne, je trouve que Medium est un fabuleux terrain d\u2019\u00e9criture et de publication. Vous \u00e9crivez votre texte, vous le publiez. Du fait qu\u2019il s\u2019agit d\u2019un r\u00e9seau, vous n\u2019\u00eates pas seul. Vous pouvez interagir avec les textes des autres, les surligner, les conserver, les annoter, les aimer et le faire savoir. L\u2019\u00e9l\u00e8ve fait usage de la machine \u29eb Mais avant m\u00eame que l\u2019enfant d\u00e9veloppe telle ou telle comp\u00e9tence, il lui faut un minimum de connaissances disons informatiques. De la m\u00eame fa\u00e7on qu\u2019on a con\u00e7u le socle commun cens\u00e9 repr\u00e9senter (\u00e0 la fin de la scolarit\u00e9) le minimum obligatoire, il faudrait concevoir un bagage informatique n\u00e9cessaire. Je suis toujours surpris de constater que, ann\u00e9e apr\u00e8s ann\u00e9e, les \u00e9l\u00e8ves confondent toujours navigateur et moteur de recherche, fichier et document... Ils ne savent pas ce qu\u2019est un client mail, n\u2019ont jamais entendu parler de syst\u00e8me de fichiers, ignorent ce qu\u2019est un OS. URL, DNS sont des acronymes abscons, etc. Mais reconnaissons qu\u2019ils le sauraient s\u2019ils manipulaient tout cela un peu plus souvent. Je ne crois pas qu\u2019il faille cr\u00e9er une nouvelle mati\u00e8re sp\u00e9cifique, ce qui n\u2019est d\u2019ailleurs pas \u00e0 l\u2019ordre du jour, du moins au coll\u00e8ge. Pour l\u2019heure, j\u2019ai vu beaucoup d\u2019\u00e9l\u00e8ves incapables d\u2019enregistrer un fichier, incapables de le retrouver, de le transmettre\u2026 Entendons-nous bien. Je ne les accuse pas d\u2019une nullit\u00e9 d\u00e9plorable. Je constate simplement que certains \u00e9l\u00e8ves ont d\u00e9velopp\u00e9 des connaissances tr\u00e8s sp\u00e9cifiques (par exemple, jouer aux script kiddies), mais ont une connaissance tr\u00e8s vague de principes de base. Ce sont des autodidactes \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9cole, ce qui est un comble ! Finalement, ce dont ils ont besoin, c\u2019est d\u2019une pratique r\u00e9guli\u00e8re de l\u2019ordinateur (ou de la tablette ou du smartphone). Cette pratique, non pas pour elle-m\u00eame, mais pour produire l\u2019un ou l\u2019autre contenu signal\u00e9 ci-dessus. Ce blog liste quelques-uns des points qu'il serait n\u00e9cessaire d'acqu\u00e9rir sans quoi le travail est rendu compliqu\u00e9 par les risques de perte ou les pertes de temps. Par exemple, son auteur s'\u00e9tonne \u00e0 juste titre de voir les \u00e9l\u00e8ves ignorer les touches fl\u00e9ch\u00e9es sur le clavier pour se d\u00e9placer dans un texte. Au lieu de \u00e7a, ils recourent \u00e0 la touche baskspace (retour en arri\u00e8re, en fran\u00e7ais) pour corriger un mot, quitte \u00e0 effacer tout le texte pour atteindre le terme \u00e0 corriger ! In fine, vous l\u2019aurez compris, l\u2019\u00e9l\u00e8ve initi\u00e9 au num\u00e9rique est un humaniste : faire preuve de jugement, savoir s\u2019exprimer \u00e0 l\u2019aide de diff\u00e9rents m\u00e9dias, d\u00e9fendre des id\u00e9es de partage, participer au d\u00e9veloppement de projets communs, devenir altruiste\u2026 Voil\u00e0 les objectifs qui me semblent \u00eatre ceux de l\u2019\u00e9cole num\u00e9rique. Parce qu\u2019 \u00ab Il y a de l\u2019humain derri\u00e8re l\u2019algorithme \u00bb, explique Jean-Baptiste Casaux \u00e0 propos de l\u2019application Citymapper, il est important que l\u2019\u00e9cole formule ses priorit\u00e9s. Je ne suis pas s\u00fbr qu\u2019apprendre \u00e0 coder en soit une. L\u2019algorithme peut bien attendre. Si l\u2019on met celui-ci au centre de l\u2019apprentissage, l\u2019humain s\u2019en d\u00e9sint\u00e9ressera. Pourquoi voulez-vous que l\u2019algorithme int\u00e9resse davantage des enfants que la SVT ou la 3e r\u00e9publique ? Ce qui nous am\u00e8ne \u00e0 cette question : l\u2019\u00e9l\u00e8ve doit-il apprendre \u00e0 coder ?","title":"10 objectifs de l\u2019\u00e9cole num\u00e9rique"},{"location":"%C3%89criture/Un%20Centaure%20%C3%A0%20l%27%C3%A9cole/10%20objectifs%20de%20l%E2%80%99%C3%A9cole%20num%C3%A9rique/#leleve-est-un-ecrivain","text":"Le num\u00e9rique, c\u2019est le retour \u00e0 la case Gutenberg. Les \u00e9l\u00e8ves \u00e9crivent et \u00e9crivent beaucoup dans des situations tr\u00e8s diverses : ils tweetent, ils chattent, mettent \u00e0 jour leur statut, envoient des SMS, ils bloguent, ils ont peut-\u00eatre un journal, ils notent des bribes d\u2019informations \u00e7\u00e0 et l\u00e0, ils r\u00e9digent pour l\u2019\u00e9cole de nombreux textes de nature assez diverse, ils font des livres eux-m\u00eames avec un simple traitement de texte (et l\u2019extension idoine) ou une app d\u00e9di\u00e9e, ils participent au d\u00e9veloppement d\u2019une encyclop\u00e9die libre et gratuite, ils \u00e9crivent \u00e0 \u00e0 leur professeur (par le truchement du mail, du chat, de l\u2019ENT\u2026), etc. ^e6851b Le succ\u00e8s d\u2019Anna Todd montre que le jeune \u00e9crivain a bien quelque chose de cette petite poucette dont parle Michel Serres. \u00c9crivant fr\u00e9n\u00e9tiquement avec les pouces sur son smartphone un fanfic, s\u2019autopubliant sur Wattpad, cet espace d\u00e9mocratique dans lequel on peut oser \u00eatre auteur (m\u00eame un auteur sans orthographe), b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiant du soutien, des commentaires et autres conseils de ses lecteurs avides de d\u00e9couvrir la suite, cette jeune fille est devenue millionnaire. Bien \u00e9videmment, je n\u2019insinue pas le moins du monde qu\u2019\u00e9crire vous fera entrer dans le club tr\u00e8s ferm\u00e9 des millionnaires, mais qu\u2019au moins, quelles que soient vos comp\u00e9tences et vos go\u00fbts, vous pouvez \u00e9crire, aimer \u00e9crire et conna\u00eetre un certain succ\u00e8s, du moins avoir une audience, quelle qu'elle soit. Pour autant, jamais un enfant n\u2019a eu autant besoin de ma\u00eetriser les codes de l\u2019\u00e9crit, de la typographie et de l\u2019orthographe. Il doit avoir du style au double sens du terme : il use les styles de son traitement de texte (diff\u00e9rencier le corps du texte des titres de chapitre et des sous-titres, etc.) et poss\u00e8de une belle plume. Aussi doit-il savoir utiliser dictionnaires num\u00e9riques et logiciels d\u2019aide \u00e0 la r\u00e9daction, qui sont pl\u00e9thore et aident \u00e0 la ma\u00eetrise du langage. Or on sait qu\u2019une simple faute d\u2019orthographe sur les r\u00e9seaux sociaux peut vous faire devenir la ris\u00e9e du pays tout entier. Quelques personnalit\u00e9s politiques l\u2019exp\u00e9rimentent r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement. L\u2019acad\u00e9mie d\u2019Orl\u00e9ans-Tours a mis en ligne les webbums, ouvrages relevant \u00e0 la fois du site web et de l\u2019album et qui montrent bien que l\u2019\u00e9criture scolaire a pour vocation d\u2019\u00eatre partag\u00e9e. D\u2019abord parce qu\u2019elle donne un sens nouveau \u00e0 cette activit\u00e9. L\u2019\u00e9l\u00e8ve n\u2019\u00e9crit plus de mauvaise gr\u00e2ce pour un enseignant plus ou moins int\u00e9ress\u00e9 par de m\u00e9diocres productions, mais gagne un lectorat qui s\u2019\u00e9largit et qui peut interagir avec lui et lui donner envie de mieux faire, de s\u2019appliquer davantage. Ainsi mes \u00e9l\u00e8ves sont toujours contents d\u2019apprendre qu\u2019ils ont obtenu tant de \u00ab J\u2019aime \u00bb ou qu\u2019un journaliste s\u2019est int\u00e9ress\u00e9 \u00e0 leur travail. Il y a l\u00e0 une motivation nouvelle qui galvanise les enfants. L\u2019application InkleWriter permet d\u2019aller plus loin en vous proposant d\u2019\u00e9crire des histoires interactives dans lesquelles le lecteur est invit\u00e9 \u00e0 choisir la suite de l\u2019intrigue entre plusieurs options. Si vous avez lu dans votre jeunesse les \u00ab livres dont vous \u00eates le h\u00e9ros \u00bb, vous savez de quoi je parle. Quelle plus belle invitation \u00e0 \u00e9crire diverses histoires pour un lectorat v\u00e9ritablement partie prenante ? Ces activit\u00e9s d\u2019\u00e9criture sont souvent des activit\u00e9s collaboratives voire pluridisciplinaires puisqu\u2019il a bien fallu illustrer les textes voire les enrichir de sons ou de vid\u00e9os. Mes \u00e9l\u00e8ves avaient ainsi fait pr\u00e9c\u00e9der leurs contes d\u2019une petite vid\u00e9o explicative, une sorte de making of racontant ce qu\u2019ils avaient voulu faire passer comme message \u00e0 travers leurs histoires. Le num\u00e9rique, c\u2019est la fascination retrouv\u00e9e pour \u00ab l\u2019\u00e9criture \u00bb dans un sens tr\u00e8s large. C'est de cette profusion des techniques dont t\u00e9moignent les mots en \u00ab -graphe \u00bb issus du grec \u00ab graphein \u00bb : photographe, radiographe, \u00e9chographe, t\u00e9l\u00e9graphe, phonographe, phonautographe, dactylographe, stylographe, etc. Pourquoi diable ferions-nous une fixation sur la seule orthographe ? A-t-on perdu cette passion plurielle d\u2019\u00e9crire ? Ou plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment s\u2019est-elle repli\u00e9e sur elle-m\u00eame dans le champ scolaire uniquement d\u00e9volu \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9criture \u00e0 la main ? Ces activit\u00e9s d\u2019\u00e9criture ne seront jamais pour certaines d\u2019entre elles d\u2019aucune esp\u00e8ce d\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat pour un \u00e9l\u00e8ve de 11 ans, mais le d\u00e9veloppement du num\u00e9rique ne nous rappelle-t-il pas que l\u2019\u00e9tendue de la \u00ab graphie \u00bb d\u00e9passe de loin nos habitudes scolaires et qu\u2019il faut que les \u00e9l\u00e8ves s\u2019emparent de ces techniques, non pas isol\u00e9ment, de fa\u00e7on cloisonn\u00e9e comme cela peut l\u2019\u00eatre aujourd\u2019hui dans telle ou telle mati\u00e8re (le son ici, l\u2019image l\u00e0), mais de fa\u00e7on synth\u00e9tique ? Les documents num\u00e9riques sont pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment constitu\u00e9s de tout cela, de textes, de sons, d\u2019images fixes ou mobiles. Pour Pierre L\u00e9vy, le num\u00e9rique pose \u00ab la question de la fin du logocentrisme, de la destitution d'une certaine supr\u00e9matie du discours sur les autres modes de communication \u00bb. Et s'il y a bien quelque chose d\u2019assez fascinant avec le num\u00e9rique, c'est qu'il permet \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9criture de se d\u00e9barrasser des inconv\u00e9nients que Socrate pouvait lui trouver : \u00ab C\u2019est que l\u2019\u00e9criture, Ph\u00e8dre, a, tout comme la peinture, un grave inconv\u00e9nient. Les \u0153uvres picturales paraissent comme vivantes ; mais, si tu les interroges, elles gardent un v\u00e9n\u00e9rable silence. Il en est de m\u00eame des discours \u00e9crits. Tu croirais certes qu\u2019ils parlent comme des personnes sens\u00e9es ; mais, si tu veux leur demander de t\u2019expliquer ce qu\u2019ils disent, ils te r\u00e9pondent toujours la m\u00eame chose. Une fois \u00e9crit, tout discours roule de tous c\u00f4t\u00e9s ; il tombe aussi bien chez ceux qui le comprennent que chez ceux pour lesquels il est sans int\u00e9r\u00eat ; il ne sait point \u00e0 qui il faut parler, ni avec qui il est bon de se taire. S\u2019il se voit m\u00e9pris\u00e9 ou injustement injuri\u00e9, il a toujours besoin du secours de son p\u00e8re, car il n\u2019est pas par lui-m\u00eame capable de se d\u00e9fendre ni de se secourir. \u00bb Ainsi l\u2019\u00e9crit n\u2019est plus jamais fig\u00e9 \u00ab en un v\u00e9n\u00e9rable silence \u00bb. Le lecteur peut toujours demander des explications et l\u2019auteur peut r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 travers les commentaires ou les modifications et les processus de mise \u00e0 jour. Ainsi Wikip\u00e9dia est pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment (et contrairement \u00e0 ce qu\u2019affirmait \u00e0 Eidos 64 Milad Doueihi) l\u2019absence de consensus. L\u2019auteur et chercheur interview\u00e9 par la journaliste Louise Tourret affirmait que l\u2019encyclop\u00e9die p\u00eachait par sa recherche syst\u00e9matique du consensus et que la science \u00e9tait l\u2019oppos\u00e9e du consensus. Or c\u2019est tout \u00e0 fait faux ou plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment, si Wikip\u00e9dia pr\u00e9tend donner un acc\u00e8s aux informations brutes et qu\u2019en effet elle recherche une certaine objectivit\u00e9, on ne peut nier que derri\u00e8re chaque page de l\u2019encyclop\u00e9die, ce sont des dizaines et parfois des centaines de pages de discussions et de d\u00e9bats. En somme, il y a l\u00e0 une vivacit\u00e9 (au sens propre) de l\u2019id\u00e9e, une certaine plasticit\u00e9 \u00e0 laquelle il faudrait sensibiliser les \u00e9l\u00e8ves. \u00c9crire, ce n\u2019est plus penser une fois et publier et \u00e9ventuellement r\u00e9diger un nouveau livre parce qu\u2019on a progress\u00e9 dans ses recherches, c\u2019est un continuel r\u00e9ajustement de sa pens\u00e9e confront\u00e9e \u00e0 celle d\u2019autrui. Ce n\u2019est pas la moindre merveille du num\u00e9rique que de permettre aux \u00e9l\u00e8ves d\u2019acqu\u00e9rir tr\u00e8s t\u00f4t cette aptitude \u00e0 \u00e9crire et donc \u00e0 manier le langage. En fait, d\u00e8s le plus jeune \u00e2ge, on peut amener les enfants sinon \u00e0 \u00e9crire du moins \u00e0 parler. C\u2019est ce que de nombreux enseignants font avec des applications qui permettent d\u2019enregistrer les \u00e9l\u00e8ves. S\u2019ils ne peuvent \u00e9crire, du moins savent-ils parler et d\u00e8s lors on peut les amener tr\u00e8s t\u00f4t \u00e0 s\u2019exprimer, \u00e0 articuler, \u00e0 mieux prononcer certains mots et m\u00eame \u00e0 structurer un r\u00e9cit. M'inspirant des pratiques de V\u00e9ronique Favre, je me suis amus\u00e9 \u00e0 le faire un \u00e9t\u00e9 avec ma fille quand elle avait 5 ou 6 ans. J\u2019ai une forte aversion pour les cahiers de vacances. Pour autant, je suis quand m\u00eame un peu d\u00e9sireux, en parent soucieux de l\u2019\u00e9ducation de mes enfants, de faire travailler ces derniers. Sans pour autant sacrifier \u00e0 d\u2019imp\u00e9rieuses exigences, j\u2019ai eu envie d\u2019utiliser l\u2019iPad pour \u00e0 la fois passer un bon moment avec la petite derni\u00e8re mais aussi pour la faire travailler. J\u2019avais \u00e9galement dans l\u2019id\u00e9e de rel\u00e9guer au second plan le travail d\u2019\u00e9criture, de graphie ou d\u2019orthographe (lesquels seront largement trait\u00e9s tout au long de la scolarit\u00e9) et d\u2019accorder davantage d\u2019importance \u00e0 des points importants parfois d\u00e9l\u00e9gu\u00e9s \u00e0 des sp\u00e9cialistes extrascolaires, que ceux-ci soient orthophonistes ou conteurs professionnels : l\u2019\u00e9locution, la prononciation, mais aussi l\u2019\u00e9laboration et la diction d\u2019un r\u00e9cit. Un point non n\u00e9gligeable \u00e9tait \u00e0 prendre en compte : le travail r\u00e9alis\u00e9 ferait l\u2019objet d\u2019une diffusion d\u2019abord familiale (projection sur la t\u00e9l\u00e9), puis d\u2019une mise en ligne sur YouTube. Pour ce faire, nous avons opt\u00e9 pour le spectacle de marionnettes avec l\u2019application PuppetPals HD. Nous avons \u00e9labor\u00e9 diff\u00e9rentes s\u00e9quences (en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral correspondant aux changements de personnages) puis nous avons mont\u00e9 le tout dans iMovie. Avec les plus grands, il est possible d\u2019arriver un r\u00e9sultat similaire (un film mont\u00e9 sur iMovie) mais apr\u00e8s \u00e9criture d\u2019un sc\u00e9nario. Quelle que soit l\u2019activit\u00e9 envisag\u00e9e, on passe par une activit\u00e9 d\u2019\u00e9criture. \u00c0 ce propos, un \u00e9l\u00e8ve doit apprendre \u00e0 taper sur un clavier. \u00c0 lui les joies de la dactylographie. Il est hors de question de le voir continuer \u00e0 taper \u00e0 deux doigts (grand maximum). Et, comme un vrai codeur, il a les mains riv\u00e9es sur le clavier, usant de tous les raccourcis possibles et imaginables. En attendant la g\u00e9n\u00e9ralisation d'une telle pratique, il n'est pas rare de voir qu'un ordinateur a \u00e9t\u00e9 confi\u00e9 \u00e0 un \u00e9l\u00e8ve dyspraxique, dyslexique et dysorthographique. Et de constater que le rem\u00e8de est pire que le mal. \u00c9crire vite et bien sur un clavier n'est pas plus ais\u00e9 qu'\u00e0 la main. Dext\u00e9rit\u00e9 et v\u00e9locit\u00e9 ne sont pas inn\u00e9es. Cela s'acquiert. Il faut que l'\u00e9cole le permette.","title":"L\u2019\u00e9l\u00e8ve est un \u00e9crivain"},{"location":"%C3%89criture/Un%20Centaure%20%C3%A0%20l%27%C3%A9cole/10%20objectifs%20de%20l%E2%80%99%C3%A9cole%20num%C3%A9rique/#leleve-est-polyglotte","text":"Se couper de l\u2019anglais, c\u2019est se couper d\u2019une partie consid\u00e9rable du web, cette invention et (quasi) propri\u00e9t\u00e9 am\u00e9ricaine. Il existe tant d\u2019informations disponibles en anglais et uniquement en anglais ! Et il existe de si belles applications pour l\u2019apprendre que ce serait un crime de s\u2019en passer. Babbel et English Central sont deux exemples fameux, mais on peut aussi \u00e9voquer Pilipop ou Duolingo, non limit\u00e9es \u00e0 l\u2019anglais. Compte tenu du nombre d\u2019applications qui ne sont pas traduites en anglais, l\u2019utilisateur est de plus en plus amen\u00e9 \u00e0 se familiariser avec le vocabulaire anglo-saxon. Les \u00ab Save \u00bb, \u00ab File \u00bb ou autre \u00ab Link \u00bb sont d\u00e9sormais des mots extr\u00eamement courants, \u00e0 un tel point que l\u2019Acad\u00e9mie fran\u00e7aise peine \u00e0 faire accepter certaines traductions comme la baladodiffusion. Qu'on le veuille ou non, le bain linguistique est quotidien. \u00c0 ce propos, c\u2019est surtout quand j\u2019ai d\u00e9couvert les podcasts que je me suis rendu compte combien il devenait ais\u00e9 de travailler les langues. C\u2019est en fait en 2005 lorsqu\u2019Apple a int\u00e9gr\u00e9 le support du podcast dans la version 4.9 d\u2019iTunes que je me suis aper\u00e7u de la richesse d\u2019\u00e9missions qui renouvelaient ce qui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 fait avec la radio dans les ann\u00e9es 1930 mais en laissant le loisir \u00e0 l\u2019auditeur de t\u00e9l\u00e9charger et d\u2019\u00e9couter ad libitum les fichiers de son choix. Je me souviens en particulier d\u2019une \u00e9mission qui existe toujours et qui s\u2019appelle English As A Second Language Podcast et qui a d\u00e9pass\u00e9 depuis le millier d\u2019\u00e9pisodes. Son auteur, Jeff McQuillan, est un enseignant vivant \u00e0 Los Angeles. Le principe de l\u2019\u00e9mission (du moins \u00e0 sa cr\u00e9ation) est de vous aider \u00e0 am\u00e9liorer votre anglais en vous proposant des sujets aussi divers qu\u2019aller au restaurant ou au cin\u00e9ma, acheter un ordinateur ou faire le m\u00e9nage. Dans la premi\u00e8re partie de l\u2019\u00e9mission, le texte est dit tr\u00e8s lentement de fa\u00e7on \u00e0 vous permettre de comprendre du mieux que vous pouvez ce qui est dit. Une deuxi\u00e8me partie est une explication enti\u00e8rement en anglais des mots de vocabulaire li\u00e9s au th\u00e8me de l\u2019\u00e9mission. Enfin la derni\u00e8re partie r\u00e9p\u00e8te le texte initial mais \u00e0 une vitesse normale. Le podcast s\u2019ach\u00e8ve sur quelques r\u00e9ponses \u00e0 des questions envoy\u00e9es par des auditeurs sur des points de grammaire ou de vocabulaire. Ce podcast est une aide extraordinaire \u00e0 l\u2019acquisition de connaissances linguistiques. L\u2019acte de se mettre ses \u00e9couteurs sur les oreilles (\u00ab podcast \u00bb provient de \u00ab iPod \u00bb et de \u00ab broadcast \u00bb), la r\u00e9gularit\u00e9 de l\u2019\u00e9coute du podcast, le c\u00f4t\u00e9 artisanal de l\u2019\u00e9mission (du moins pour les premi\u00e8res), la voix sympathique et attentionn\u00e9e du locuteur cr\u00e9ent un sentiment de proximit\u00e9 avec l\u2019auteur. Il en va de m\u00eame des centaines de tutoriels que j\u2019ai pu suivre, bien avant la mode des YouTubeurs, et qui venant principalement des \u00c9tats-Unis dans un premier temps vous contraignaient \u00e0 conna\u00eetre l\u2019anglais (de m\u00eame si vous voulez suivre ces grands show que sont, par exemple, les keynote d\u2019Apple). Mais aujourd\u2019hui les tutoriels ou les podcasts affluent du monde entier, aussi bien de France que de Cor\u00e9e du Sud. Et on aurait tort de penser que les \u00e9l\u00e8ves ne les regardent pas. D'autres plateformes ont vu le jour. Je pense, entre autres, \u00e0 SoundCloud (ce r\u00e9seau social du son) qui permet notamment de diffuser des podcasts mais aussi des chansons, des livres audio ou m\u00eame des cours. Ce blog illustre les diff\u00e9rents moyens qui s'offrent \u00e0 vous pour perfectionner votre ma\u00eetrise d'une langue, comme \u00e9couter de la musique gratuite dont les paroles sont en ligne. Plus amusante est la possibilit\u00e9 de mettre vos propres enregistrements en ligne afin de confronter votre connaissance de la langue ainsi que votre prononciation aux usagers du r\u00e9seau et recevoir leurs remarques. Mieux encore, cr\u00e9ez un groupe, une communaut\u00e9 d'utilisateurs. Vous pourrez commenter et ins\u00e9rer votre commentaire \u00e0 l'endroit pr\u00e9cis du fichier sur lequel vous souhaitez intervenir ou obtenir une pr\u00e9cision, une information ou une explication. Le succ\u00e8s des s\u00e9ries est un avatar d'un autre succ\u00e8s, celui qu\u2019ont pu conna\u00eetre les romans-feuilletons (qu\u2019on appelait d\u2019ailleurs les feuilletons romans) au XIXe si\u00e8cle. \u00c0 cette \u00e9poque, Alexandre Dumas ou Eug\u00e8ne Sue \u00e9taient les auteurs en vogue et les histoires qu\u2019ils publiaient par \u00e9pisodes dans les journ\u00e9es explosaient les ventes. Aujourd\u2019hui, cet engouement s\u2019est d\u00e9plac\u00e9 et se trouve dans les s\u00e9ries qui fascinent les spectateurs et les font piaffer d\u2019impatience dans l\u2019attente que leur s\u00e9rie pr\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9e arrive en France parfois avec des traductions plus ou moins heureuses et parfois avec une diffusion al\u00e9atoire des \u00e9pisodes. Les fans de s\u00e9ries se sont alors mis \u00e0 t\u00e9l\u00e9charger sur des sites \u00e0 la l\u00e9galit\u00e9 douteuse des \u00e9pisodes pour lesquels ils n\u2019avaient pas envie d\u2019attendre. Comme ceux-ci \u00e9taient disponibles d\u00e8s le lendemain, l\u2019attente \u00e9tait de courte dur\u00e9e. Mais en un temps si court, l\u2019\u00e9pisode est \u00e9videmment disponible en VO. Et de fait, on a pu remarquer que nos plus jeunes \u00e9l\u00e8ves d\u00e9voraient les m\u00eames s\u00e9ries que leurs professeurs, et cela dans la langue de Shakespeare. Pourvu que la chose se fasse dans la l\u00e9galit\u00e9, il serait bon que cette passion t\u00e9l\u00e9visuelle soit exploit\u00e9e en classe. Les ann\u00e9es passant, j'ai remarqu\u00e9 que je devenais plus exigeant avec mes enfants et que je leur demandais syst\u00e9matiquement de choisir (sur Netflix) la version originale. Bien s\u00fbr, il n\u2019y a pas que l\u2019anglais. Comme la Chine est le nouveau territoire de jeu des entrepreneurs, il serait temps de proposer ou de g\u00e9n\u00e9raliser l\u2019apprentissage de cette langue. Sur le clavier virtuel de votre smartphone, vous avez d\u00e9j\u00e0 le clavier (les claviers) n\u00e9cessaire(s). Quelle que soit la langue que vous choisirez, pourquoi ne pas utiliser Skype in the classroom ? Vous pouvez m\u00eame jouer au Mystery Skype et trouver une classe dans le monde entier. Le principe est simple. Vous conversez avec une classe inconnue et \u00e0 propos de laquelle vous ne savez rien. Le but du jeu est de d\u00e9couvrir d\u2019o\u00f9 ils viennent, dans quel pays ils habitent, dans quelle ville, etc. Ce petit jeu linguistique n\u2019a absolument rien de fantaisiste, n\u2019a rien d\u2019improvis\u00e9 et requiert de la classe et de l\u2019enseignant une pr\u00e9paration et une organisation importantes, comme en t\u00e9moigne le blog de ce professeur. Pour jouer \u00e0 ce jeu qui engage tous les \u00e9l\u00e8ves, il faut pr\u00e9parer des questions pertinentes sur un document partag\u00e9 et un autre o\u00f9 seront consign\u00e9es les questions et les r\u00e9ponses, apprendre \u00e0 utiliser diverses ressources comme un atlas ou des dictionnaires en ligne, assigner \u00e0 chacun un r\u00f4le (les chercheurs, ceux qui accueillent la classe, ceux qui posent les questions, ceux qui \u00e9crivent les informations re\u00e7ues, ceux qui organisent les prises de parole, ceux qui pr\u00e9sentent les photos qu\u2019ils ont prises, ceux qui sont charg\u00e9s du respect des r\u00e8gles typographiques ou orthographiques, etc.). Un tel jeu linguistique est une v\u00e9ritable immersion et procure un petit frisson. C\u2019est un petit voyage chez soi. Je trouve le proc\u00e9d\u00e9 vraiment fabuleux. Au reste, on le verra plus bas, d\u2019autres applications permettent de revisiter la notion de correspondance et de s\u2019adresser potentiellement au monde entier. Je crois aussi que la lecture num\u00e9rique est une invitation \u00e0 lire sans appr\u00e9hension un texte en langue \u00e9trang\u00e8re. Les dictionnaires int\u00e9gr\u00e9s pouvant \u00eatre convoqu\u00e9s \u00e0 partir du mot qui pose un probl\u00e8me facilitent l\u2019appropriation du lexique. D\u2019ailleurs, quel \u00e9l\u00e8ve ne recourt pas au c\u00e9l\u00e8bre Google Translate, dont l\u2019utilisation (d\u2019un point de vue scolaire) n\u2019est pas si \u00e9vidente que cela ? Il faudrait aider les \u00e9l\u00e8ves \u00e0 utiliser \u00e0 bon escient une telle application et surtout \u00e0 ne pas lui accorder une confiance aveugle. Les professeurs de langue savent bien de quoi je veux parler. C'est lors de la semaine de la presse que je me suis aper\u00e7u que la barri\u00e8re de la langue n'en \u00e9tait plus une. J'avais montr\u00e9 aux \u00e9l\u00e8ves comment utiliser Feedly et l'un d'eux s'\u00e9tait abonn\u00e9 au flux RSS de The Verge, car il \u00e9tait int\u00e9ress\u00e9 par les voitures. Il avait utilis\u00e9 Google Translate, qui s'en sortait plut\u00f4t bien et qui rendait accessible ce qui auparavant ne l'\u00e9tait pas.","title":"L\u2019\u00e9l\u00e8ve est polyglotte"},{"location":"%C3%89criture/Un%20Centaure%20%C3%A0%20l%27%C3%A9cole/10%20objectifs%20de%20l%E2%80%99%C3%A9cole%20num%C3%A9rique/#leleve-est-un-grand-lecteur","text":"Combien de textes, de lignes, de mots lit-on par jour ? Notices en tout genre, signalisation, post it, consignes, journaux, le\u00e7ons, extraits, contes, romans, c'est l'empire du signe. De m\u00eame que le num\u00e9rique a donn\u00e9 une profusion d'\u00e9crivains (ou, si le mot vous para\u00eet trop fort, d'\u00e9crivants, pour reprendre le mot de Roland Barthes), de m\u00eame (corollairement) y a-t-il une profusion de lecteurs. On n'a jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 autant lu. M\u00eame la recherche d'une vid\u00e9o est pr\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9e de la lecture des r\u00e9sultats par votre moteur. Peut-\u00eatre ne lit-on pas toujours de ces grands ouvrages qui font notre fiert\u00e9 quand nous les exposons sur les rayons de notre biblioth\u00e8que, mais enfin on lit. On lit la presse qui s'est adapt\u00e9e, parfois enrichie dans sa version num\u00e9rique qui par la m\u00eame occasion \u00e0 engendr\u00e9 de nouveaux acteurs : les pure players mais aussi les blogs et les tweets des journalistes. Mon application de lecture de flux RSS me fait chaque jour un peu plus penser au tonneau des Dana\u00efdes : je la remplis sans cesse et je vais pouvoir continuer encore longtemps. C'est d\u00e9sormais une bonne centaine de sites qui y sont r\u00e9unis. Et encore cet amas a pour voisin mes comptes Facebook et Twitter qui soumettent \u00e0 ma voracit\u00e9 encore un peu plus de suggestions de lectures. Or, on le constate lors de la semaine de la presse, lire sur le web est une pratique quasi inconnue de nos \u00e9l\u00e8ves. Combien savent ce qu\u2019est un agr\u00e9gateur de contenu ? Ce qu\u2019est un fichier XML ou un flux RSS ? Qui conna\u00eet Readability, Instapaper (qui m'a consid\u00e9rablement aid\u00e9 \u00e0 r\u00e9diger le livre que vous lisez) ou Pocket ? Combien savent garder, ordonner ce flot d\u2019informations quotidien, archiver, annoter et retrouver les notes de leur lecture ? Il est aussi possible d\u2019archiver tel ou tel passage dans son application pr\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9e de prise de notes. Pour ma part, je fais des captures d\u2019\u00e9cran des passages des livres qui m\u2019ont int\u00e9ress\u00e9. Et puisqu\u2019une application comme Evernote (OCR oblige) est capable de chercher du texte dans une image, cela ne pose aucun probl\u00e8me \u00e0 cette m\u00e9thode d\u2019archivage qui s\u2019est impos\u00e9e \u00e0 moi je ne sais trop comment. Peut-\u00eatre parce que certains livres prot\u00e9g\u00e9s par des DRM ne facilitent pas vraiment l\u2019option de partage. Les DRM sont \u00e0 eux seuls un v\u00e9ritable plaidoyer en d\u00e9faveur du livre num\u00e9rique, du moins quand il en est pourvu, ainsi que la d\u00e9cision de certains \u00e9diteurs de d\u00e9sactiver le copier/coller. Cette ablation technique me fait en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral consid\u00e9rer que le piratage est pr\u00e9f\u00e9rable \u00e0 la l\u00e9galit\u00e9 qui ne vous permet pas de faire des choses tr\u00e8s simples comme copier un extrait qu\u2019on voudrait par exemple donner \u00e0 ses \u00e9l\u00e8ves. Heureusement il existe plusieurs solutions comme les OCR (bis repetita). Combien d'\u00e9l\u00e8ves savent automatiser cette proc\u00e9dure d'archivage avec une application comme IFTTT par exemple ? Combien savent partager leur lecture ? Il y a l\u00e0 une urgence \u00e0 enseigner ces nouvelles fa\u00e7ons de lire et on per\u00e7oit facilement combien ces nouveaux usages am\u00e9lioreraient significativement les performances des \u00e9l\u00e8ves. Je crois m\u00eame qu\u2019il y a simplement urgence \u00e0 leur r\u00e9v\u00e9ler cette richesse du web qui ne se borne pas \u00e0 ce que propose Facebook, ce site faisant tout pour vous rendre captif de son r\u00e9seau et vous \u00e9viter d\u2019aller voir ailleurs. De plus, l\u2019acte de lire, au XXIe si\u00e8cle, s\u2019est consid\u00e9rablement complexifi\u00e9. C\u2019est devenu un art \u00e0 part enti\u00e8re que de savoir user de toutes les fonctionnalit\u00e9s li\u00e9es au livre num\u00e9rique. Et lire est un enjeu majeur tant il est vrai que l\u2019acc\u00e8s \u00e0 la connaissance est conditionn\u00e9 par cette comp\u00e9tence. Mais surtout on lit partout, tout le temps. Les fichiers num\u00e9riques (le PDF, le doc, l\u2019odt, le html, l\u2019ePub\u2026) sont commenc\u00e9s ici et termin\u00e9s l\u00e0. Avec la multiplication des terminaux, on lit sur sa tablette, sur son t\u00e9l\u00e9phone, sur sa liseuse, sur son ordinateur et la synchronisation de tous ces objets sans qu'on n\u2019ait rien \u00e0 faire est une incitation \u00e0 reprendre sa lecture o\u00f9 que l\u2019on soit et quel que soit l\u2019appareil que l\u2019on a sur soi \u00e0 ce moment-l\u00e0. D\u00e9couvrir la liseuse a \u00e9t\u00e9 pour moi le d\u00e9but d\u2019une longue histoire d\u2019amour, et d\u2019un progressif \u00e9loignement du livre papier (\u00e9loignement que je ne cherche pas \u00e0 imposer \u00e0 qui que ce soit). \u00c0 force de lire sur ma liseuse, je trouve que le livre (disons traditionnel, mais \u00e7a ne veut tellement rien dire si l\u2019on pense \u00e0 ses multiples m\u00e9tamorphoses, du volumen au codex) a pour lui plusieurs inconv\u00e9nients : son poids, ses pages qui ne tiennent pas et qui se rabattent, l\u2019ombre de la main (ou simplement toute ombre r\u00e9sultant de la position du livre par rapport \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re) sur la page la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 d\u2019avoir un \u00e9clairage pour lire (c\u2019est tout b\u00eate mais avec la liseuse, j\u2019ai fini par oublier que j\u2019avais besoin d\u2019une source de lumi\u00e8re pour lire), l\u2019encre qui s\u2019efface (du moins celle de ces affreux livres de poche) les traces de doigt ou de tout ce que vous pouvez manipuler lors de votre lecture (allant de la nourriture au c\u00e9rumen, en passant par les crottes de nez. Que celui qui ne s\u2019est jamais livr\u00e9 \u00e0 une telle pratique me jette la premi\u00e8re\u2026 ce que vous voulez...) le papier de mauvaise qualit\u00e9 (car les lecteurs ne sont pas tous assez fortun\u00e9s pour se payer de beaux livres imprim\u00e9s sur du v\u00e9lin). En revanche, force est de constater qu\u2019avec une liseuse, on perd plusieurs choses : on voit moins la couverture et on m\u00e9morise donc moins bien le nom de l\u2019auteur ; on perd la conscience de l\u2019\u00e9paisseur du livre et de l\u2019endroit o\u00f9 l\u2019on se situe. Avec une liseuse, on peut ainsi tr\u00e8s facilement se trouver tout surpris d\u2019\u00eatre \u00e0 la fin (sp\u00e9cialement quand une partie du pourcentage comprend diverses choses comme une postface ou un sommaire). Mais ce n\u2019est pas sans procurer quelque nouvelle \u00e9motion litt\u00e9raire tant on est d\u00e9concert\u00e9 de se trouver \u00e0 la derni\u00e8re page sans que rien ne nous y ait pr\u00e9par\u00e9. Cela dit, il est facile d\u2019afficher la barre de progression, et de voir o\u00f9 on se trouve, mais je n\u2019utilise que fort peu cette possibilit\u00e9. le livre se pr\u00eate moins ais\u00e9ment ; il se donne encore moins et m\u00eame s'il existe quelques solutions plus ou moins l\u00e9gales, il est concevable que ces inconv\u00e9nients freinent les ardeurs de lecteurs d\u00e9sireux de go\u00fbter aux joies de la lecture num\u00e9rique. Toutefois, on remarquera que les avantages l\u2019emportent largement sur les quelques inconv\u00e9nients qui peuvent se transformer en avantage (du moins pour le second). Je n'ai pas mentionn\u00e9 la batterie qui tient des semaines. Avec la liseuse, j\u2019appr\u00e9cie aussi de pouvoir acc\u00e9der instantan\u00e9ment au livre d\u00e9sir\u00e9. Je n\u2019ai pas m\u00eame besoin de me lever pour lire le dernier prix Goncourt. Certains trouveront que c\u2019est un d\u00e9faut. C\u2019est affaire de point de vue. Pour moi qui ai habit\u00e9 dans des lieux o\u00f9 la culture \u00e9tait peu accessible, j\u2019y ai vu un net avantage. Et puis m\u00eame si on peut trouver \u00e0 redire sur les livres et sa vente qui s\u2019apparente davantage \u00e0 de la location, il faudra quand m\u00eame reconna\u00eetre qu\u2019une application comme Calibre vous d\u00e9barrasse relativement facilement de la plupart des DRM ind\u00e9sirables. Enfin, si vous regrettez l'interm\u00e9diaire que constitue le libraire, sachez qu'il y a aussi YouTube et que nos youtubeurs ne font plus uniquement de petits sketchs rigolos ou ne prodiguent plus uniquement des conseils de maquillage. Non, sur YouTube, on parle \u00e9galement lecture. On parle alors de BookTube. Autre exemple, le Boloss des Belles Lettres r\u00e9v\u00e8le la pr\u00e9gnance de la litt\u00e9rature y compris sur la toile. Force est bien de reconna\u00eetre que la lecture n\u2019est plus vraiment un vice (impuni) ou en tout cas que la lecture est devenue \u00e9minemment sociale.","title":"L\u2019\u00e9l\u00e8ve est un grand lecteur"},{"location":"%C3%89criture/Un%20Centaure%20%C3%A0%20l%27%C3%A9cole/10%20objectifs%20de%20l%E2%80%99%C3%A9cole%20num%C3%A9rique/#leleve-est-un-etre-sociable","text":"Le num\u00e9rique est une invitation \u00e0 la promiscuit\u00e9, au \u00ab vivre ensemble \u00bb, \u00e0 la sociabilisation, au partage de l\u2019information. Non seulement l\u2019\u00e9l\u00e8ve partage mais il en tire un grand b\u00e9n\u00e9fice. S\u2019il lit (m\u00eame un tweet), il le partage. Il \u00e9crit tout un livre ? Il le diffuse sur Wattpad.

Il l\u2019a d\u00e9couvert sur un \u00ab pad \u00bb, il approfondit cette comp\u00e9tence en \u00e9crivant pour et avec autrui. La chose n\u2019est pas nouvelle. M\u00eame la traditionnelle r\u00e9daction est d\u00e9j\u00e0 une \u0153uvre collective : le sujet est donn\u00e9 par l\u2019enseignant qui donne des conseils, l\u2019\u00e9l\u00e8ve \u00e9crit et est ensuite aid\u00e9 par ses parents, fr\u00e8res ou s\u0153urs... Enfin l'enseignant corrige... Les devoirs que les enseignants donnent \u00e0 leurs \u00e9l\u00e8ves sont tr\u00e8s souvent r\u00e9alis\u00e9s collaborativement. Qu'ils chattent, se fassent \u00ab une cam \u00bb (visioconf\u00e9rence) ou demandent de l'aide sur les r\u00e9seaux sociaux ou dans les commentaires, nos \u00e9l\u00e8ves ont d\u00e9j\u00e0 commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 apprendre ensemble. Les \u00e9l\u00e8ves au d\u00e9but du si\u00e8cle s\u2019\u00e9taient empar\u00e9s du blog et \u00e9crivaient massivement. C\u2019\u00e9tait l\u2019\u00e9poque des skyblogs. Le 22 novembre 2009, il y avait 28 416 340 blogs accessibles via Skyrock.com. On avait connu l\u2019\u00e9poque de la R\u00e9publique des blogs et les coll\u00e9giens n\u2019\u00e9chappaient pas \u00e0 cette mode. C\u2019\u00e9tait avant l\u2019invasion massive des r\u00e9seaux sociaux. Certes les textes publi\u00e9s n\u2019\u00e9taient pas d\u2019une grande qualit\u00e9. Souvent la typographie, les choix esth\u00e9tiques et surtout l\u2019orthographe piquaient all\u00e8grement les yeux, mais enfin il faut tout de m\u00eame reconna\u00eetre qu\u2019on ne pouvait pas reprocher \u00e0 nos \u00e9l\u00e8ves d\u2019\u00e9crire. Le plus triste dans tout cela est que l\u2019\u00c9ducation nationale et donc les enseignants (moi y compris) n\u2019aient pas \u00e9t\u00e9 fichus de les accompagner dans cette pratique. C\u2019est pourtant dommage. Cet article de madmoiZelle.com montre bien ce que peut repr\u00e9senter cette plong\u00e9e dans \u00ab l\u2019univers de tes 14 ans \u00bb, car on peut maintenant mesurer l\u2019effet des pratiques li\u00e9es \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9criture et \u00e0 la lecture sur le web et \u00e9duquer s\u00e9rieusement les \u00e9l\u00e8ves. Mais d\u00e9j\u00e0 on peut comprendre \u00e0 quel point devenir un \u00ab \u00eatre sociable \u00bb est compliqu\u00e9. \u00catre confront\u00e9 \u00e0 la question des droits, entrer dans la hi\u00e9rarchie des gens populaires, exprimer l\u00e0 o\u00f9 c\u2019est possible ses sentiments, \u00eatre confront\u00e9 \u00e0 la dure loi des commentaires, savoir r\u00e9pondre ou ne pas r\u00e9pondre et savoir que tout cela est inscrit durablement, car ce qui est publi\u00e9 sur internet\u2026 reste publi\u00e9 sur internet et pour longtemps. La premi\u00e8re fois que je me suis aper\u00e7u que mes \u00e9l\u00e8ves \u00e9taient eux aussi sur Twitter, j\u2019ai d\u00e9couvert des propos vraiment stup\u00e9fiants. Ils \u00e9taient en train de s\u2019\u00e9charper et s\u2019insultaient copieusement, publiquement et sans retenue avec une vulgarit\u00e9 que je n\u2019aurais pas soup\u00e7onn\u00e9e chez certains d\u2019entre eux. D\u2019ailleurs, il m\u2019arrive de mettre \u00e0 la poubelle certains commentaires sur mon site. Ce sont des tombereaux d\u2019insultes quand, par exemple, il n\u2019y a pas le corrig\u00e9 d\u2019un questionnaire sur tel ou tel livre. J\u2019ai du mal \u00e0 ne pas faire le lien avec ce qui s\u2019est pass\u00e9 avec l\u2019intelligence artificielle de Microsoft. Le 23 mars, Tay, est une machine, une IA, qui tweete pour la premi\u00e8re fois. Son profil est celui d\u2019une adolescente plut\u00f4t sympathique. Le principe de son fonctionnement est simple. Plus on lui parle, plus son vocabulaire et sa capacit\u00e9 de raisonnement s\u2019\u00e9toffent. Malheureusement, si tout se passe bien au d\u00e9but (\u00ab les humains sont super cools \u00bb, d\u00e9clare Tay), ses propos deviennent rapidement misogynes et racistes jusqu\u2019\u00e0 s\u2019exclamer \u00ab Hitler avait raison et je hais tous les juifs \u00bb. Que s\u2019est-il pass\u00e9 ? Eh bien, c\u2019est fort simple. Tous les trolls du web se sont donn\u00e9 rendez-vous pour discuter avec l\u2019IA de Microsoft et forts de la conviction que l\u2019IA s\u2019impr\u00e9gnait par imitation de ce qu\u2019on lui disait, ils n\u2019ont eu de cesse que de lui ass\u00e9ner des propos tous plus ind\u00e9cents les uns que les autres. En somme, l\u2019IA s\u2019est fa\u00e7onn\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019image de ce qui lui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 renvoy\u00e9. C\u2019\u00e9tait une sorte de perroquet. Comment ne pas se dire que les adolescents - les vrais - fonctionnent de la m\u00eame fa\u00e7on. Une sorte de mim\u00e9tisme, de psittacisme qu'on d\u00e9signe g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement par l'expression effet de mode ou qui rel\u00e8ve plus banalement d'une p\u00e9riode de la vie pousse les adolescents \u00e0 s'impr\u00e9gner des propos des autres. On ne peut les laisser livr\u00e9s \u00e0 eux-m\u00eames. Or c\u2019est ce qui arrive si l\u2019\u00e9cole ne leur apprend pas \u00e0 \u00eatre des cr\u00e9atures sociables, polies et respectueuses. Il y a mille et une fa\u00e7ons d\u2019apprendre \u00e0 l\u2019enfant \u00e0 \u00eatre sociable sur le web. Entre autres, cela faisait longtemps que je projetais de faire \u00e9crire \u00e0 mes \u00e9l\u00e8ves des articles pour l\u2019encyclop\u00e9die libre Vikidia, ce Wikip\u00e9dia \u00e0 destination des 8-13 ans. J\u2019h\u00e9sitais seulement encore un peu sur le choix des articles \u00e0 \u00e9crire. Est-ce que dans un travail interdisciplinaire, j\u2019aiderai les \u00e9l\u00e8ves \u00e0 r\u00e9diger leur article sur une machine \u00e0 fraiser ou sur la digestion ? En tapant \u00ab star wars \u00bb puis \u00ab bb-8 \u00bb dans Vikidia, je me suis aper\u00e7u que, pour le second, l\u2019article \u00e9tait inexistant. Connaissant l\u2019engouement des \u00e9l\u00e8ves pour le nouveau Star Wars (on \u00e9tait en d\u00e9cembre 2015 \u00e0 ce moment-l\u00e0), je me suis aussit\u00f4t dit : \u00ab Bingo ! Voil\u00e0 ce qu\u2019il faut faire \u00bb. C\u2019est l\u2019occasion r\u00eav\u00e9e d\u2019initier les \u00e9l\u00e8ves \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9criture d\u2019articles encyclop\u00e9diques, mais aussi \u00e0 la notion de libre, de partage, etc. C\u2019est un travail fabuleux \u00e0 r\u00e9aliser avec les \u00e9l\u00e8ves : chercher des informations, prendre ce qui est n\u00e9cessaire, le conserver tout en le notant avec ses mots \u00e0 soi (et non recopier, tout un d\u00e9fi qui entend enfin mettre un terme au copier-coller), l\u2019ordonner et garder les r\u00e9f\u00e9rences exactes de ses sources, r\u00e9diger en soignant l\u2019orthographe mais aussi la ponctuation puis la syntaxe wiki (les balises n\u00e9cessaires \u00e0 la mise en page d\u2019une page sur un wiki). Tout cela constitue un travail important dont la finalit\u00e9 est celle d\u2019une contribution \u00e0 une encyclop\u00e9die libre. Ce n'est pas rien. C'est tout de m\u00eame la premi\u00e8re fois dans l'histoire de l'humanit\u00e9 que des enfants participent \u00e0 un tel projet encyclop\u00e9dique. Dans le cadre de la classe, les \u00e9l\u00e8ves ont travaill\u00e9 par groupes. Ils d\u00e9couvrent en publiant sur Vikidia que d\u2019autres lecteurs voient ce qui est \u00e9crit, le lisent, le corrigent, le commentent, le compl\u00e8tent, l\u2019enrichissent. \u00c0 tout moment, ils peuvent remonter dans le temps et comparer les diff\u00e9rentes versions du travail collectif. Une chose assez amusante \u00e0 noter : des \u00e9l\u00e8ves n\u2019avaient pas eu le temps de finir leur article. La sonnerie venait de retentir. Ils enregistrent leur article sur l\u2019encyclop\u00e9die. Quelques minutes apr\u00e8s, deux contributeurs avaient achev\u00e9 de mettre en forme le travail des \u00e9l\u00e8ves. \u00c9crire est donc une \u0153uvre collaborative. C\u2019est un processus stimulant dans lequel on ne sent jamais seul et qui a une finalit\u00e9 qui exc\u00e8de la finalit\u00e9 du devoir habituel que l\u2019\u00e9l\u00e8ve n\u2019a pas envie d\u2019\u00e9crire et que le professeur n\u2019a pas envie de corriger. De plus, les \u00e9l\u00e8ves comprennent bien qu\u2019un mauvais travail ne fera pas long feu sur Vikidia. Des erreurs de mise en forme, des erreurs d\u2019orthographe seront signal\u00e9es et probablement corrig\u00e9es. Le plagiat sera d\u00e9couvert et la paternit\u00e9 de leur travail remise en cause. Il y a l\u00e0 une exigence qui s\u2019ajoute \u00e0 celle de l\u2019enseignant et qui, \u00e0 bien des \u00e9gards, para\u00eet davantage imp\u00e9rative. En fait, l\u2019\u00e9l\u00e8ve ne travaille plus jamais seul. On l\u2019a vu, le num\u00e9rique n\u2019est pas une invitation \u00e0 se replier sur soi et sa machine. Il travaille avec les autres. Il apprend \u00e0 d\u00e9l\u00e9guer, \u00e0 s\u2019organiser, \u00e0 faire confiance aux autres, \u00e0 responsabiliser le r\u00e9fractaire, \u00e0 demander de l\u2019aide aux autres. C\u2019est en cela que la disposition en U susmentionn\u00e9e au d\u00e9but de ce livre est un non-sens. Pourquoi r\u00e9unir des enfants dans une classe si c\u2019est pour les faire travailler s\u00e9par\u00e9ment ? Et ce n\u2019est pas toujours facile. En r\u00e9unissant des \u00e9l\u00e8ves par groupe, on prend conscience de leur difficult\u00e9 \u00e0 travailler ensemble, \u00e0 accepter les remarques ou \u00e0 temp\u00e9rer l\u2019autorit\u00e9 de tel \u00e9l\u00e8ve ou \u00e0 dynamiser tel autre \u00e9l\u00e8ve passif et soumis \u00e0 toute proposition (ou plut\u00f4t imposition) du voisin. Il faut donc inciter l\u2019\u00e9l\u00e8ve \u00e0 aller vers l\u2019autre. Il doit participer \u00e0 diff\u00e9rents projets que seul le num\u00e9rique a rendus possibles : il cr\u00e9e une web radio, une web TV, des podcasts, etc. Il interviewe des enseignants, des sportifs, des artistes et mobilise de nombreuses comp\u00e9tences pour arriver \u00e0 ses fins. Il sait enregistrer, travailler le son, utiliser des bruitages et agr\u00e9menter son travail d\u2019une musique. C\u2019est pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment ce que l\u2019on peut faire en enregistrant des audiobooks. C\u2019est un bel exemple de travail collaboratif. C\u2019est un plaisir que de voir les \u00e9l\u00e8ves r\u00e9unis autour d\u2019une table, autour d\u2019un projet commun et qui travaillent d\u2019arrache-pied \u00e0 la r\u00e9alisation de leur livre audio. Je n\u2019ai jamais vu autant de photocopies annot\u00e9es et dont le texte est soulign\u00e9, surlign\u00e9, entour\u00e9 afin d\u2019indiquer qui lit quoi et comment. Une fois encore, le num\u00e9rique permet de mieux faire passer des imp\u00e9ratifs scolaires. On peut exiger d\u2019un \u00e9l\u00e8ve qui lise et relire encore tel ou tel passage pour qu\u2019il lise mieux, plus fort, en articulant davantage et en mettant le ton. Mais c\u2019est parfois compliqu\u00e9 d\u2019obtenir un r\u00e9sultat. Il y a des fois un peu de mauvaise volont\u00e9 due \u00e0 une absence de motivation. Enregistrer des livres audio permet de cr\u00e9er cette motivation. On lit pour quelqu\u2019un (car l\u2019un des objectifs est de partager le travail sur SoundCloud) et ce travail \u00e9tant enregistr\u00e9 (et s\u2019inscrivant donc dans la dur\u00e9e), la plupart des \u00e9l\u00e8ves sont soucieux de bien faire et r\u00e9clament d\u2019eux-m\u00eames qu\u2019on recommence tel enregistrement parce qu\u2019il n\u2019est pas r\u00e9ussi ou pas assez convaincant \u00e0 leur avis. Il y a d\u2019ailleurs un travail remarquable \u00e0 effectuer de prime abord : celui de donner assez de confiance aux \u00e9l\u00e8ves pour qu\u2019ils acceptent leur voix qu\u2019ils jugent quasi syst\u00e9matiquement peu appr\u00e9ciable. Mais quel plaisir ensuite de voir que leur travail est remarqu\u00e9, qu\u2019il a \u00e9t\u00e9 amplement \u00e9cout\u00e9, partag\u00e9 et m\u00eame diffus\u00e9 quand celui-ci faisait l\u2019objet d\u2019un article par un journaliste !","title":"L\u2019\u00e9l\u00e8ve est un \u00eatre sociable"},{"location":"%C3%89criture/Un%20Centaure%20%C3%A0%20l%27%C3%A9cole/10%20objectifs%20de%20l%E2%80%99%C3%A9cole%20num%C3%A9rique/#leleve-communique","text":"Il est sur les r\u00e9seaux sociaux et sait que sa parole l\u2019engage. Il diffuse tous azimuts et conna\u00eet les moyens de le faire. De ce point de vue, il sait donc \u00e9crire et en sait suffisamment pour cr\u00e9er son propre blog. Mais il sait aussi user de tous les moyens que l\u2019on conna\u00eet : les QR codes, la r\u00e9alit\u00e9 augment\u00e9e n\u2019ont rien pour lui d\u2019in\u00e9dit. Son quotidien en est envahi et, comme chez Marie Souli\u00e9, les murs de sa classe parlent. Pourquoi l\u2019affiche resterait-elle une simple affiche ? Pourquoi celle-ci ne s\u2019enrichirait-elle pas d\u2019informations qu\u2019un smartphone pourrait convoquer ? Par exemple d\u2019un QR code renvoyant \u00e0 des exercices ou encore, par le biais de la r\u00e9alit\u00e9 augment\u00e9e, le cours qui a fait l\u2019objet d\u2019une vid\u00e9o (et que l\u2019on appelle le plus souvent une capsule) peut appara\u00eetre l\u00e0 aussi sur l\u2019affiche, par le truchement du smartphone. Ainsi l\u2019information est partout et l\u2019\u00e9l\u00e8ve contribue \u00e0 la transmettre, car c\u2019est lui-m\u00eame qui r\u00e9alise ces affiches qui lui permettent de mesurer la validit\u00e9 de ses acquis. C\u2019est un travail in\u00e9dit sur la m\u00e9morisation. C\u2019est un nouveau moyen d\u2019acc\u00e8s \u00e0 la connaissance. La Twict\u00e9e, cette dict\u00e9e sur Twitter, est \u00e0 ce propos un enjeu int\u00e9ressant. On fait d\u2019une pierre deux coups en enseignant aux enfants l\u2019orthographe tout en les enjoignant \u00e0 partager ce travail sur Twitter, \u00e0 aider les autres et \u00e0 prendre confiance en eux. Ils ont ainsi franchi des fronti\u00e8res, au sein m\u00eame de leur propre classe, puisque l\u2019on communique avec d\u2019autres classes aux quatre coins du globe. L\u2019utilisation d\u2019Edmodo donne un souffle nouveau aux bonnes vieilles correspondances et les \u00e9changes d\u2019un continent \u00e0 l\u2019autre sont devenus monnaie courante. L\u2019univers de nos \u00e9l\u00e8ves n\u2019est plus la classe, c\u2019est la plan\u00e8te tout enti\u00e8re. Avec sa photo de profil (sa PP comme on dit), il se pr\u00e9sente par-del\u00e0 les mers. Mais il ne communique pas seulement, il transmet ses connaissances aux \u00e9l\u00e8ves de primaire comme peuvent le faire, par exemple, les \u00e9l\u00e8ves de Julia Dumont, professeur et r\u00e9f\u00e9rent num\u00e9rique de son \u00e9tablissement. Les \u00e9l\u00e8ves de 5e de Julia Dumont et de ses coll\u00e8gues ont cr\u00e9\u00e9 des ressources num\u00e9riques \u00e0 destination des \u00e9l\u00e8ves de primaire pour les accompagner dans leurs apprentissages. Ils r\u00e9investissent ce qu\u2019ils voient en classe et partagent leurs connaissances par le num\u00e9rique. Ainsi, en d\u00e9but d\u2019ann\u00e9e, quand ils n\u2019avaient pas encore de tablettes, les \u00e9l\u00e8ves ont cr\u00e9\u00e9 des questionnaires plickers pour les CM2. Puis quand ils les ont re\u00e7ues, ils ont eu l\u2019id\u00e9e de leur faire r\u00e9aliser des tutoriels sur le filtrage de l\u2019eau. Ceux-ci ont r\u00e9investi l\u2019exp\u00e9rience de d\u00e9cantation et de filtrage de l\u2019eau qui est au programme de 5e. Ils se mettent par groupes, refont l\u2019exp\u00e9rience vue en classe avec leur professeur et prennent de nombreuses photos. Ils les trient ensuite, les annotent, et r\u00e9alisent un tutoriel avec l\u2019application BookCreator (1 tutoriel par groupe). Le tutoriel termin\u00e9, ils \u00e9tablissent collectivement une grille d\u2019\u00e9valuation et reprennent si besoin leur tutoriel en fonction de celle-ci. Les \u00e9l\u00e8ves de primaire viennent ensuite au coll\u00e8ge pour r\u00e9aliser l\u2019exp\u00e9rience eux-m\u00eames. Ils sont r\u00e9partis par groupe et ont pour seule aide l\u2019un des tutos des 5e. Ils doivent refaire l\u2019exp\u00e9rience \u00e9tape par \u00e9tape et de pr\u00e9f\u00e9rence la r\u00e9ussir. Les auteurs du tutoriel qu\u2019ils ont en main les suivent \u00e0 distance pendant ce temps et constatent ou non les failles de leur travail : les \u00e9l\u00e8ves du primaire arrivent-ils \u00e0 bien s\u00e9lectionner, \u00e0 utiliser le mat\u00e9riel ? Ont-ils bien toutes les \u00e9tapes ? Je trouve le projet du coll\u00e8ge Albert Camus \u00e0 Bayonne absolument extraordinaire. Ce projet et celui de Julia Dumont repr\u00e9sentent \u00e0 mes yeux ce que le num\u00e9rique peut produire de meilleur. Dans le cas des enseignants du coll\u00e8ge Albert Camus, il s\u2019agit de r\u00e9aliser des audioguides pour le coll\u00e8ge \u00e0 destination des nouveaux \u00e9l\u00e8ves de 6e ainsi que des familles qui d\u00e9couvriront ainsi l\u2019\u00e9tablissement. Ce n\u2019est rien moins qu\u2019une visite virtuelle qui est propos\u00e9e, un peu comme celles que l\u2019on trouve dans les mus\u00e9es. Vous avez d\u00e9j\u00e0 probablement visit\u00e9 une exposition avec un casque sur les oreilles et suivi des explications audio concernant le tableau que vous regardiez. C\u2019est le m\u00eame principe. Les \u00e9l\u00e8ves ont utilis\u00e9 l\u2019application izi-TRAVEL. Il a fallu \u00e9crire les textes pr\u00e9sentant les b\u00e2timents et les enregistrer. Des QR codes ont \u00e9t\u00e9 cr\u00e9\u00e9s, appos\u00e9s sur chaque b\u00e2timent et ces derniers, une fois lus avec un t\u00e9l\u00e9phone, vous am\u00e8nent \u00e0 l\u2019application et donc la visite virtuelle contenant les photos, la g\u00e9olocalisation, les explications, etc. Ce qui fait la richesse du projet, c\u2019est que celui-ci est interdisciplinaire. L\u2019\u00e9tablissement ayant une population d\u2019\u00e9l\u00e8ves de diverses origines, les enseignants ont eu l\u2019id\u00e9e d\u2019associer les professeurs de langue afin de r\u00e9aliser les audioguides en plusieurs langues (anglais, espagnol). Des parents ont m\u00eame accept\u00e9 de traduire dans d\u2019autres langues comme le turc. Ainsi personne n\u2019\u00e9tait laiss\u00e9 de c\u00f4t\u00e9 en raison de ses capacit\u00e9s linguistiques. L\u2019\u00e9ducation aux m\u00e9dias \u00e9tait une \u00e9vidence dans tout projet de ce type puisqu\u2019il faut montrer aux \u00e9l\u00e8ves que l\u2019on ne saurait utiliser telle image ou telle musique sans s\u2019acquitter de droits parfois on\u00e9reux. Pour r\u00e9aliser les photographies, les \u00e9l\u00e8ves ont eu l\u2019autorisation d\u2019utiliser leur t\u00e9l\u00e9phone. C\u2019est donc un travail sur le texte, le son, l\u2019image. Par ces exemples, on voit que l\u2019\u00e9crit n\u2019est pas la seule comp\u00e9tence \u00e0 d\u00e9velopper chez l\u2019\u00e9l\u00e8ve, m\u00eame si c\u2019est quelque chose d\u2019extr\u00eamement important. Le travail sur le son montre l\u2019importance de l'oral qui est souvent une activit\u00e9 n\u00e9glig\u00e9e, qui est en tout cas plac\u00e9e en dessous de l'\u00e9crit. C\u2019est un peu, en fran\u00e7ais, l\u2019\u00e9quivalent de la ponctuation (et ne parlons m\u00eame pas de la typographie). On est tous convaincu que son enseignement est absolument important, mais on se consacre \u00e0 des choses plus visibles, la grammaire ou l\u2019orthographe. Or, on vient de le voir, l\u2019\u00e9cole est le royaume de l\u2019\u00e9crit. La plupart des examens (du moins au coll\u00e8ge), des notes sont li\u00e9s \u00e0 l'\u00e9crit. La l\u00e9gitimit\u00e9 de l'oral peut se retrouver par le num\u00e9rique : les tout-petits (voir plus haut l\u2019exemple de Puppet Pals HD) comme les plus grands (cf. les audiobooks, les \u00e9l\u00e8ves film\u00e9s pour r\u00e9aliser les fiches de lecture avec la r\u00e9alit\u00e9 augment\u00e9e ou pour se pr\u00e9senter...). Les activit\u00e9s li\u00e9es \u00e0 l\u2019oral pourraient cependant \u00eatre qualifi\u00e9es d\u2019oral r\u00e9dig\u00e9 : le th\u00e9\u00e2tre, la t\u00e9l\u00e9vision, les interviews pour une \u00e9mission de radio\u2026 Ces derni\u00e8res sont tr\u00e8s int\u00e9ressantes \u00e0 observer. Quand les \u00e9l\u00e8ves se lancent dans ce genre d\u2019activit\u00e9, ils ont tendance \u00e0 privil\u00e9gier des questions ferm\u00e9es limitant les possibilit\u00e9s de la conversation. Ils ont aussi tendance \u00e0 accueillir la r\u00e9ponse de l\u2019autre comme une fin de non-recevoir. C\u2019est comme si ce que disait l\u2019autre ne pouvait \u00eatre accueilli que dans l\u2019acceptation totale. Il a \u00e9t\u00e9 dit ceci ou cela, et les \u00e9l\u00e8ves ont peu l\u2019habitude de demander des d\u00e9tails suppl\u00e9mentaires, des pr\u00e9cisions. Ils n\u2019osent tout simplement pas dire qu\u2019ils n\u2019ont pas compris. Il est une autre activit\u00e9 que j\u2019aimerais mettre en place, le \u00ab talk \u00bb. Un \u00e9l\u00e8ve, sur un sujet de son choix, doit pr\u00e9senter en cinq minutes \u00e0 l'aide d'un PowerPoint une anecdote, une activit\u00e9, un domaine du programme, un voyage, etc. Il s\u2019agit de l\u2019inviter \u00e0 se mettre en avant, \u00e0 exposer ce pour quoi il se passionne voire \u00e0 admettre l\u2019opinion d\u2019autrui sur ce qu\u2019il a de plus cher. Le maniement d\u2019un logiciel du type PowerPoint ne serait pas superf\u00e9tatoire. Combien d\u2019adultes ignorent les rudiments de son usage ! Et comment en serait-il autrement ? Personne ne leur a appris \u00e0 s\u2019en servir ! Il me semble que cette activit\u00e9 de communication pourrait avoir une autre vertu. Des \u00e9l\u00e8ves ne peuvent pratiquer une activit\u00e9 sportive ? Pourquoi pas ne pas recourir \u00e0 ces \u00e9l\u00e8ves pour qu\u2019ils participent, comme ces \u00e9l\u00e8ves qui, lors du cross, vont interviewer les participants ? Pourquoi diable des \u00e9l\u00e8ves dispens\u00e9s de telle activit\u00e9 seraient r\u00e9duits \u00e0 l\u2019inactivit\u00e9 totale ? Le num\u00e9rique \u00e9tant \u00e9minemment socialisant, l\u2019\u00e9l\u00e8ve communique, partage ses connaissances, soutient l\u2019\u00e9l\u00e8ve en difficult\u00e9. Il partage donc ses comp\u00e9tences. De la m\u00eame fa\u00e7on, l\u2019enseignant communique avec la famille : s\u2019\u00e9crire ou m\u00eame se parler \u00e9vacue les difficult\u00e9s, les doutes, les errements. Pour ma part, je pr\u00e9f\u00e8re que l\u2019on m\u2019\u00e9crive, chez moi, \u00e0 l\u2019heure que l\u2019on veut, plut\u00f4t que de trouver le lendemain matin un \u00e9l\u00e8ve dont le d\u00e9sarroi d\u00e9coule de son incapacit\u00e9 \u00e0 avoir fait son travail. Ainsi, on accompagne les \u00e9l\u00e8ves que personne ne peut aider \u00e0 la maison. Enfin un peu de justice dans l\u2019enfer dominical des devoirs ! Au reste, comme mes cours sont directement tap\u00e9s sur mon iPad et vid\u00e9oprojet\u00e9s, il m\u2019est tr\u00e8s facile de les envoyer par mail (mais on verra plus bas qu\u2019il y a encore plus simple). Je pourrais m\u00eame filmer le cours, et le transmettre aux absents.","title":"L\u2019\u00e9l\u00e8ve communique"},{"location":"%C3%89criture/Un%20Centaure%20%C3%A0%20l%27%C3%A9cole/10%20objectifs%20de%20l%E2%80%99%C3%A9cole%20num%C3%A9rique/#leleve-manipule-limage","text":"L\u2019\u00e9l\u00e8ve a acquis une comp\u00e9tence en la mati\u00e8re qui force l\u2019\u00e9tonnement.

Cette d\u00e9mocratisation des usages en rappelle une autre. Souvenons-nous du slogan de Kodak et de son appareil photographique commercialis\u00e9 en 1888 : \u00ab You Press the Button, We Do the Rest ! \u00bb. L'\u00e9l\u00e8ve sait souligner les d\u00e9tails et enregistrer la fr\u00eale beaut\u00e9 d\u2019un moment qui agr\u00e9mente reportages, expos\u00e9s ou tutoriels, notamment lors de sorties scolaires. Il manipule all\u00e8grement Canva ou Post d'Adobe pour illustrer tout ce qui doit l'\u00eatre et cr\u00e9er des banni\u00e8res et des logos (comme pour notre radio ou notre future cha\u00eene de t\u00e9l\u00e9). Comme ce professeur de philosophie, l\u2019\u00e9l\u00e8ve peut se saisir d\u2019Instagram comme d\u2019une contrainte fructueuse pour d\u00e9finir une notion avec concision ou prodiguer un conseil. On peut m\u00eame se demander si le num\u00e9rique ne permet pas tout simplement d\u2019acc\u00e9der \u00e0 la beaut\u00e9 artistique. Vous qui \u00eates n\u00e9 dans les ann\u00e9es 70 ou 80, vous \u00eates-vous d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9merveill\u00e9, \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9cole, de la splendeur de tel tableau ? De tel manuscrit enferm\u00e9 dans les coffres-forts de la BNF ? De tel film en haute d\u00e9finition ? Eh bien ! non, puisque vous n\u2019aviez que cette photocopie en noir et blanc ou cette t\u00e9l\u00e9 \u00e0 tube cathodique juch\u00e9e sur l\u2019armoire du coin de la classe ! Quant aux merveilles de la BNF, vous n\u2019y aviez simplement pas acc\u00e8s. L\u2019\u00e9l\u00e8ve devrait savoir produire un bon mash-up capable de susciter le rire sur des questions d\u2019actualit\u00e9 (et \u00e0 ce propos, la semaine de la presse devrait \u00eatre\u2026 annuelle). Il use \u00e0 foison des gifs anim\u00e9s qui sont devenus \u00e9galement un moyen de communication.

L\u2019\u00e9l\u00e8ve produit ses propres tutoriels sur YouTube (voir ces vid\u00e9os sur l\u2019utilisation de Scratch ou encore le travail des \u00e9l\u00e8ves de Na\u00efma Horchani Carton). J'avais beaucoup aim\u00e9 voir les jeunes \u00e9l\u00e8ves de Fran\u00e7ois Lamoureux se saisir de leur tablette pour expliquer ce qu'est un triangle \u00e9quilat\u00e9ral ou un polygone. Le recours au fond vert d\u00e9cuple les possibilit\u00e9s : mettre en sc\u00e8ne une fiction plus vraie que nature est chose possible. En fran\u00e7ais, nous l'utilisons pour adapter des fables de La Fontaine afin d'en faire des sayn\u00e8tes. L\u2019\u00e9l\u00e8ve sait donc ce qu\u2019est un logiciel de montage vid\u00e9o et conna\u00eet diff\u00e9rents formats (et pas seulement du .wma ou de l\u2019.avi). Mais pour faire de la vid\u00e9o, combien il est important de persuader ces jeunes \u00e9l\u00e8ves qu\u2019il faut accepter sa voix et son corps, qu\u2019il faut accepter de se mettre en avant, face \u00e0 une cam\u00e9ra. Que de comp\u00e9tences sont ainsi \u00e0 cr\u00e9er ! Rien que pour faire une vid\u00e9o en classe, il faut acqu\u00e9rir les connaissances, organiser ses id\u00e9es, \u00e9crire le script, (se) filmer, monter le film puis diffuser et partager. Les professeurs d\u2019art plastique s\u2019en donnent d\u2019ailleurs \u00e0 c\u0153ur joie et combien d\u2019ateliers vid\u00e9o pr\u00e9parant \u00e0 la section audiovisuelle au lyc\u00e9e peut-on trouver ! En parcourant le travail de ces \u00e9l\u00e8ves et de leur enseignant, on voit que toute l\u2019histoire du cin\u00e9ma se retrouve dans leurs productions : depuis le cin\u00e9ma muet et ses sauts dans des sacs de patates jusqu\u2019aux sketchs plus sophistiqu\u00e9s o\u00f9 se retrouvent Stop Motion ou pixilation.","title":"L\u2019\u00e9l\u00e8ve manipule l\u2019image"},{"location":"%C3%89criture/Un%20Centaure%20%C3%A0%20l%27%C3%A9cole/10%20objectifs%20de%20l%E2%80%99%C3%A9cole%20num%C3%A9rique/#leleve-est-un-chercheur","text":"Avant, le travail de l\u2019\u00e9l\u00e8ve \u00e9tait d\u2019apprendre \u00e0 lire, puis de lire tout ce qui lui \u00e9tait soumis. C\u2019\u00e9tait on ne peut plus simple. Dor\u00e9navant, l\u2019\u00e9l\u00e8ve doit \u00e9galement apprendre \u00e0 interroger la validit\u00e9 de ce qui lui est soumis. Il doit apprendre \u00e0 ne pas se satisfaire des premiers r\u00e9sultats propos\u00e9s par Google. Bien souvent, il doit apprendre \u00e0 discerner que ce qui s\u2019offre \u00e0 son regard n\u2019est que publicit\u00e9 et que le lien sur lequel il vient de cliquer et qui ne s\u2019avoue pas comme tel n\u2019est que publireportage. Il doit apprendre \u00e0 ne pas se fier \u00e0 toutes les affirmations reprises ici ou l\u00e0 sans v\u00e9rification aucune. Il doit croiser les sources et d\u00e9passer les deux premi\u00e8res pages de r\u00e9sultats affich\u00e9es par le moteur de recherche. L\u2019\u00e9l\u00e8ve est donc un infatigable chercheur et il conna\u00eet les techniques li\u00e9es \u00e0 une bonne et efficace recherche. Il sait utiliser non pas un mais plusieurs moteurs de recherche : Google bien s\u00fbr, mais aussi et peut-\u00eatre surtout Duck Duck Go, Qwant ou Quant Junior, etc. Il sait affiner sa recherche en recourant \u00e0 tous les outils mis \u00e0 sa disposition, que ce soit en s\u00e9lectionnant telle ou telle option (ainsi dans Google, l\u2019option Outils de recherche lui permet d\u2019op\u00e9rer quelques s\u00e9lections comme les droits d\u2019usage, ce qui suppose qu\u2019il a \u00e9t\u00e9 initi\u00e9 aux licences Creative Commons) mais aussi en recourant \u00e0 quelques \u00e9l\u00e9ments comme des op\u00e9rateurs bool\u00e9ens (tels AND, OR ou NOT). Et l\u2019\u00e9l\u00e8ve ne s\u2019\u00e9tonne pas de tout ce que l\u2019on peut trouver \u00e0 l\u2019aide d\u2019un simple crtl + f ! Le travail \u00e0 r\u00e9aliser est titanesque, car il n\u2019a en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral pas \u00e9t\u00e9 fait. Il a pu faire l\u2019objet d\u2019une ou quelques s\u00e9ances au CDI, mais c\u2019est un travail qui devrait \u00eatre renouvel\u00e9 tout au long de la scolarit\u00e9 voire pratiqu\u00e9 r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement. Faites l\u2019essai avec vos \u00e9l\u00e8ves. Demandez-leur ce qu\u2019est un navigateur (vous pouvez m\u00eame tenter de leur faire trouver le mot tout seul, ce qui peut \u00eatre fort long), demandez-leur ce qu\u2019est un moteur de recherche, demandez-leur de vous en donner au moins cinq, demandez-leur pourquoi selon eux il faudrait multiplier l\u2019usage de moteurs de recherche au lieu de se contenter d\u2019un seul, demandez-leur s\u2019ils savent pourquoi tel r\u00e9sultat appara\u00eet en premier et non \u00e0 la page 12, demandez-leur s\u2019ils savent comment la publicit\u00e9 appara\u00eet dans les r\u00e9sultats, et vous verrez que ces usagers quotidiens du web savent tr\u00e8s peu de choses. Ce qui est doublement f\u00e2cheux, car non seulement les enseignants se sont montr\u00e9s insuffisamment soucieux de d\u00e9velopper des comp\u00e9tences de recherche, mais en plus l\u2019activit\u00e9 de la lecture, on l\u2019a vu, est beaucoup plus complexe qu\u2019auparavant. Le jeune lecteur des ann\u00e9es 90 pouvait se contenter d\u2019apprendre \u00e0 lire, aujourd\u2019hui, notre lecteur doit en plus d\u00e9terminer la validit\u00e9 de l\u2019information. Il doit donc aussi remonter \u00e0 la source d\u2019une info, d\u2019une image et ne s\u2019en laisse pas compter par toutes les rumeurs, qui pullulent \u00e0 chaque \u00e9v\u00e9nement d\u2019importance, comme ce fut le cas pour les attentats de janvier puis de novembre 2015. Il faut bien reconna\u00eetre que l\u2019\u00e9l\u00e8ve est noy\u00e9 dans un flux d\u2019informations dont un grand nombre sont fausses et archifausses. Et le faux ne semble conna\u00eetre aucune limite, comme en t\u00e9moigne cet article de Num\u00e9rama o\u00f9 l'on d\u00e9couvre que l'assaut de la cr\u00e9dulit\u00e9 ne conna\u00eet lui non plus aucune limite. Que l\u2019on songe \u00e9galement aux fausses photos qui circulent \u00e0 chaque \u00e9v\u00e9nement majeur. Lors des attentats, on pr\u00e9tendait que d\u2019autres avaient lieu en m\u00eame temps. Plus vieux, mais tout aussi int\u00e9ressants, lors d\u2019inondations en Australie, certains articles n\u2019h\u00e9sitaient pas \u00e0 pr\u00e9tendre que des requins circulaient dans les rues inond\u00e9es. Songez encore au terrorisme, aux illuminatis ou aux nombreuses th\u00e9ories du complot remettant en question tout et n\u2019importe quoi, et vous en arriverez \u00e0 la m\u00eame conclusion. L\u2019\u00e9ducation aux m\u00e9dias est cruciale. Dans un tel contexte, le CLEMI fait un travail remarquable et fournit de nombreux dossiers \u00e0 l\u2019attention des \u00e9l\u00e8ves. L\u2019\u00e9l\u00e8ve sait qu\u2019il a une responsabilit\u00e9, une responsabilit\u00e9 d\u2019autant plus grande qu\u2019il est conscient des abus li\u00e9s au droit d\u2019auteur. Mais de la m\u00eame fa\u00e7on qu\u2019il partage, il est sensible \u00e0 la culture du libre, des notions de standard, d\u2019honn\u00eatet\u00e9 et de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 intellectuelle. Si celle-ci est inali\u00e9nable, il est conscient qu\u2019un enjeu plus vaste le d\u00e9passe et contribue \u00e0 l\u2019enrichissement du bien commun. Il sait donc ce que signifient les Creative Commons et sait utiliser le travail des autres sans se livrer \u00e0 un pillage que d\u2019aucuns ne manqueraient pas de lui reprocher. L\u2019\u00e9l\u00e8ve sait que ce qu\u2019il \u00e9crit sur Vikidia est lu, et remarqu\u00e9, comment\u00e9 et supprim\u00e9 s\u2019il contrevient aux r\u00e8gles. Il sait que le plagiat est une bien vilaine chose.","title":"L\u2019\u00e9l\u00e8ve est un chercheur"},{"location":"%C3%89criture/Un%20Centaure%20%C3%A0%20l%27%C3%A9cole/10%20objectifs%20de%20l%E2%80%99%C3%A9cole%20num%C3%A9rique/#leleve-est-autonome","text":"^c4e92e Sugata Mitra est un homme passionnant. Si vous ne l\u2019avez jamais \u00e9cout\u00e9, pr\u00e9cipitez-vous sur votre ordinateur et voyez ces trois conf\u00e9rences. Ce chercheur s\u2019int\u00e9resse aux questions d\u2019\u00e9ducation, particuli\u00e8rement dans les milieux d\u00e9favoris\u00e9s. Il a men\u00e9 sa premi\u00e8re exp\u00e9rience \u00e0 New Delhi en 1999. The hole in the wall. L\u2019id\u00e9e consistait \u00e0 donner un acc\u00e8s \u00e0 un ordinateur et \u00e0 internet \u00e0 des enfants qui, de surcroit, ne parlaient pas anglais. \u00c0 cette \u00e9poque, Sugata Mitra avait un bureau \u00e0 c\u00f4t\u00e9 d\u2019un bidonville. Un mur s\u00e9parait son bureau de ce quartier. Il y avait un trou dans ce mur (d\u2019o\u00f9 le nom de l\u2019exp\u00e9rience). Un PC et un touchpad ont \u00e9t\u00e9 encastr\u00e9s dans ce trou avec une bonne connexion internet. Huit heures apr\u00e8s, un petit gar\u00e7on de huit apprenait \u00e0 une fillette de six ans qui se dressait sur la pointe des pieds comment naviguer sur internet. Chose amusante, l\u2019anglais ne semblait pas poser de probl\u00e8me \u00e0 ces enfants. Quelqu\u2019un le leur avait-il appris ? Quelqu\u2019un avait-il aid\u00e9 ces enfants ? Afin de trouver une r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 ces questions, Sugata Mitra renouvelle l\u2019exp\u00e9rience \u00e0 Shivpuri, une ville du centre de l\u2019Inde dans laquelle, s\u2019amuse le chercheur, personne n\u2019avait appris quoi que ce soit \u00e0 qui que ce soit\u2026 Il s'est pass\u00e9 la m\u00eame chose qu'\u00e0 New Delhi. L\u2019exp\u00e9rience s'est poursuivie dans le nord-est de l\u2019Inde dans un village, Madantusi, o\u00f9 il n\u2019y avait pas de professeur d\u2019anglais. Les enfants n\u2019avaient donc jamais appris l\u2019anglais. De plus, dans ce village, il n\u2019y avait pas de connexion possible \u00e0 internet. Sugata Mitra a donc mis un ordinateur et quelques CD. Il est revenu trois mois plus tard. Deux enfants \u00e9taient en train de jouer \u00e0 un jeu et se sont exclam\u00e9s : \u00ab On a besoin d\u2019une nouvelle souris et d\u2019un processeur plus puissant. \u00bb Devant la surprise du chercheur qui se demandait comment les enfants pouvaient savoir cela, ceux-ci ont expliqu\u00e9, avec une pointe d\u2019agacement, que puisque l\u2019ordinateur \u00e9tait en anglais, ils avaient d\u00fb apprendre l\u2019anglais. Mais l\u2019exp\u00e9rience la plus fascinante et la plus amusante est celle o\u00f9 Sugata Mitra s\u2019est demand\u00e9 si des enfants pouvaient apprendre par eux-m\u00eames la biotechnologie et naturellement en anglais. Il a dit \u00e0 26 enfants qu\u2019il y avait des choses tr\u00e8s compliqu\u00e9es dans l\u2019ordinateur qu\u2019il leur confiait et que ce ne serait pas \u00e9tonnant s'ils ne comprenaient absolument rien \u00e0 rien, que tout \u00e9tait en anglais et a conclu : \u00ab Je vous laisse \u00bb. Il est revenu deux mois apr\u00e8s et a demand\u00e9 aux enfants s\u2019ils avaient jet\u00e9 un \u0153il sur les choses qu\u2019il y avait sur l\u2019ordinateur : \u00ab Oui. \u2014 Avez-vous compris quelque chose ? \u2014 Non, rien du tout. \u2014 Combien de temps vous \u00eates-vous entra\u00een\u00e9s avant de d\u00e9clarer que vous ne compreniez rien ? \u2014 On a regard\u00e9 tous les jours. \u2014 Pendant deux mois, vous avez regard\u00e9 des trucs que vous ne compreniez pas ? \u2014 Litt\u00e9ralement. \u00c0 part le fait qu\u2019une mauvaise reproduction de la mol\u00e9cule d\u2019ADN est la cause de maladies g\u00e9n\u00e9tiques, on n\u2019a rien compris d\u2019autre. \u00bb Le score obtenu par la jeune fille qui a fait cette r\u00e9ponse au chercheur \u00e9tait de 30%, ce qui est bien mais malheureusement insuffisant. Sugata Mitra a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 une autre fille, une amie plus \u00e2g\u00e9e de l\u2019enfant, si elle acceptait d\u2019enseigner la biotechnologie afin que l'enfant soit re\u00e7ue \u00e0 l\u2019examen en obtenant 50%. Elle a r\u00e9pondu qu\u2019elle ne le pourrait pas puisqu\u2019elle ne connaissait rien \u00e0 la biotechnologie. Sugata Mitra a r\u00e9torqu\u00e9 qu\u2019elle n\u2019aurait qu\u2019\u00e0 utiliser la m\u00e9thode de la grand-m\u00e8re\u2026 \u00ab Qu\u2019est-ce que c\u2019est ? \u00bb s\u2019est-elle exclam\u00e9e. En fait, tout ce qu\u2019il faut faire c\u2019est se tenir derri\u00e8re l\u2019enfant et l\u2019admirer tout le temps, juste lui dire : \u00ab C\u2019est bien, c\u2019est fantastique. Qu\u2019est-ce que c\u2019est ? Peux-tu m\u2019en montrer davantage ? \u00bb Elle a fait \u00e7a pendant deux mois. Les r\u00e9sultats de la jeune fille sont pass\u00e9s de 30 \u00e0 50%, ce qui correspond au niveau attendu d\u2019un \u00e9l\u00e8ve recevant un enseignement en biotechnologie. On peut donc parier sur l\u2019autonomie des enfants. Pour cr\u00e9er l\u2019\u00e9mulation tant n\u00e9cessaire au processus d\u2019apprentissage, la m\u00e9thode de la grand-m\u00e8re est une invitation \u00e0 poursuivre les efforts, des efforts que les enfants font d\u2019eux-m\u00eames si leur curiosit\u00e9 a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9veill\u00e9e. Tout ce que l\u2019enseignant a eu \u00e0 faire a \u00e9t\u00e9 de mettre en place les conditions de mise en \u0153uvre du travail \u00e0 effectuer. Une enseignante m\u2019avait dit un jour : \u00ab En classe, je ne travaille pas. Je travaille avant, je travaille apr\u00e8s mais, pendant, ce sont les \u00e9l\u00e8ves qui travaillent \u00bb. C\u2019est ce que j\u2019appelle l\u2019autonomie. Une autonomie toute relative puisqu\u2019elle se d\u00e9roule sous les auspices bienveillants du professeur, mais aussi parce que les \u00e9l\u00e8ves travaillent en groupe et trouvent du r\u00e9confort dans l\u2019aide de leurs pairs. Soumettez-leur toutes sortes de probl\u00e8mes et ils les r\u00e9soudront seuls. \u00ab Si une m\u00e9t\u00e9orite se dirigeait vers la terre, comment ferais-tu pour savoir si elle va toucher la terre ou pas ? \u00bb Devant la perplexit\u00e9 de l\u2019enfant, Sugata Mitra, sugg\u00e8re le mot magique : \u00ab tangente \u00bb. Et c\u2019est tout. L\u2019enfant fera le reste. C\u2019est tout le sens de son programme SOLE (sefl organized learning environment). Naturellement, c'est une conception tout \u00e0 fait particuli\u00e8re de l'enseignement, mais une conception qui doit nous inciter \u00e0 r\u00e9fl\u00e9chir \u00e0 la place et au r\u00f4le des uns et des autres. Il ne s\u2019agit donc pas de laisser l\u2019enfant se d\u00e9brouiller seul, ce qui serait une d\u00e9finition de l\u2019autonomie qui mettrait \u00e0 mal le r\u00f4le de l\u2019\u00e9cole. Cette solitude est celle de l\u2019\u00e9tudiant qui doit suivre un MOOC, processus qui, comme l\u2019\u00e9crivent Andr\u00e9 Tricot et Franck Amadou, s\u2019av\u00e8re tr\u00e8s exigeant dans le sens o\u00f9 l\u2019accompagnement est plus faible que lors d\u2019un cours en pr\u00e9sentiel. \u00ab Pour \u00eatre autonome, il faut donc en avoir les moyens \u00bb \u00e9crivent les deux enseignants. Savoir quoi \u00e9tudier, quelles ressources consulter, quelles activit\u00e9s mener, quand et comment, g\u00e9rer son temps sont des comp\u00e9tences complexes. L\u2019autonomie que j\u2019appelle de mes v\u0153ux ne consiste pas \u00e0 attendre de nos petits \u00e9l\u00e8ves qu\u2019ils fassent tout tous seuls, mais bien que toutes les conditions soient r\u00e9unies pour qu\u2019ils produisent un travail riche et extr\u00eamement motivant. L\u2019an dernier, \u00e0 la demande de mon coll\u00e8gue d\u2019\u00e9ducation musicale, j\u2019avais accept\u00e9 d\u2019accompagner l\u2019orchestre et la chorale du coll\u00e8ge \u00e0 la guitare. Je suis donc venu \u00e0 quelques r\u00e9p\u00e9titions puis le soir du spectacle, nous avons jou\u00e9 les morceaux pr\u00e9vus (et choisis par les \u00e9l\u00e8ves eux-m\u00eames). Quelle ne fut pas ma surprise, \u00e0 la fin du spectacle, de voir les \u00e9l\u00e8ves qui venaient de saluer, se rassembler sur la sc\u00e8ne autour du piano ! Ils avaient pr\u00e9par\u00e9 un morceau suppl\u00e9mentaire, une sorte d\u2019hommage collectif au groupe et \u00e0 l\u2019enseignant qui avait organis\u00e9 tout cela. On ne peut pas ne pas en venir \u00e0 la conclusion que les enfants se passent fort bien de leurs ma\u00eetres. En faisant entrer le num\u00e9rique \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9cole (et en y laissant tout de m\u00eame le ma\u00eetre), l\u2019enseignement permet de diff\u00e9rencier la p\u00e9dagogie (l\u2019enseignant ne peut pas se d\u00e9multiplier, mais il peut confier aux \u00e9l\u00e8ves certaines t\u00e2ches \u00e0 r\u00e9aliser sur des ordinateurs ou des tablettes). En proc\u00e9dant ainsi, il d\u00e9gage du temps pour les plus d\u00e9munis. Et par l\u00e0 m\u00eame, il contraint les \u00e9l\u00e8ves \u00e0 devenir autonomes : ils doivent effectuer certains travaux et, tant que le professeur ne s\u2019est pas pench\u00e9 sur leur travail, celui-ci doit \u00eatre effectu\u00e9 avec la pr\u00e9cision et le s\u00e9rieux requis. De surcroit, les \u00e9l\u00e8ves apprennent \u00e0 rechercher l\u2019information, et non attendre qu\u2019on la leur donne. \u00c0 ce sujet, je trouve l'utilisation d'Aurasma en EPS permettant l'autonomie des \u00e9l\u00e8ves particuli\u00e8rement pertinente. Encore une fois, les affiches peuvent \u00eatre mises \u00e0 contribution pour indiquer aux \u00e9l\u00e8ves ce qu\u2019ils ont \u00e0 faire. Ainsi en braquant le t\u00e9l\u00e9phone ou la tablette sur l\u2019affiche, l\u2019\u00e9l\u00e8ve d\u00e9couvrira une vid\u00e9o lui indiquant l\u2019activit\u00e9 \u00e0 r\u00e9aliser. Quelque activit\u00e9 que l'on choisisse de mettre en place, le professeur cr\u00e9e les conditions du travail. Ce n'est pas \u00e0 lui de travailler face \u00e0 des \u00e9l\u00e8ves assis qui b\u00e2illent, mais aux \u00e9l\u00e8ves d'\u00eatre actifs. Dans ces conditions, l'enseignant est un animateur. Je choisis ce terme en raison de la connotation p\u00e9jorative que lui attribuent nombre de coll\u00e8gues qui, ce faisant, oublient que le mot \u00ab animateur \u00bb vient du latin \u00ab anima \u00bb et qu'il signifie l\u2019\u00e2me, l\u2019esprit","title":"L\u2019\u00e9l\u00e8ve est autonome"},{"location":"%C3%89criture/Un%20Centaure%20%C3%A0%20l%27%C3%A9cole/10%20objectifs%20de%20l%E2%80%99%C3%A9cole%20num%C3%A9rique/#leleve-publie","text":"Savoir publier est un enjeu majeur.

Bien souvent ont \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9voqu\u00e9s les enjeux d\u2019une d\u00e9mocratie participative et on imagine mal des citoyens qui ne trouveraient nulle part o\u00f9 s\u2019exprimer. Il serait \u00e9galement fort regrettable que ces m\u00eames citoyens soient paralys\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019id\u00e9e de faire des fautes orthographes ou de commettre quelque maladresse. Les moyens techniques de faire ce qui n\u2019\u00e9tait autrefois r\u00e9serv\u00e9 qu\u2019\u00e0 quelques-uns sont un progr\u00e8s. Il ne faut donc en aucun cas que ce progr\u00e8s soit amoindri par une r\u00e9serve, une timidit\u00e9 lexicale ou syntaxique. L\u2019\u00e9cole a donc un r\u00f4le important \u00e0 jouer. Plus que jamais il importe que l\u2019on sache \u00e9crire et bien \u00e9crire. Il faut aussi savoir \u00e9crire. Pas seulement poss\u00e9der les comp\u00e9tences langagi\u00e8res ni stylistiques mais aussi savoir comment on va \u00e9crire sur le web. Ce probl\u00e8me se pose avec d\u2019autant plus d\u2019acuit\u00e9 que, comme la lecture qui se fait partout (liseuse, t\u00e9l\u00e9phone, ordinateur\u2026), l\u2019\u00e9criture et la publication peuvent conna\u00eetre un essor \u00e9galement prot\u00e9iforme. Pour ma part, j\u2019aime l\u2019id\u00e9e qu\u2019un texte quel qu\u2019il soit puisse instantan\u00e9ment \u00eatre publi\u00e9 sur mon blog, dans un ePub ou sur le r\u00e9seau social de mon choix (je pense, entre autres, \u00e0 Medium). C\u2019est en ce sens que le Markdown, ce \u00ab langage \u00bb de balisage est d\u2019une utilit\u00e9 toute particuli\u00e8re. Expliquons d\u00e9j\u00e0 de quoi il retourne. Comme le dit David Bosman : \u00ab je trouve \u00e7a toujours trop compliqu\u00e9 d\u2019expliquer en th\u00e9orie un truc qui est vraiment tout con en pratique [\u2026] \u00bb Mais essayons. L\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat du Markdown est de sauter une \u00e9tape. Au lieu d\u2019\u00e9crire un texte puis de le formater (mettre certains mots en gras, en italique, cr\u00e9er des liens, etc.) en ajoutant telle ou telle balise HTML, ce qui est souvent fastidieux, on \u00e9crit son texte tout en le formatant gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 un langage qui a le bon go\u00fbt de rester discret, de ne pas encombrer le texte et donc de permettre de sauter une \u00e9tape puisqu\u2019on publie imm\u00e9diatement apr\u00e8s l\u2019\u00e9criture du texte. De plus, c\u2019est facile \u00e0 apprendre. Voyons un exemple. Souvent, on \u00e9crit son texte, comme celui-ci : On peut aussi utiliser 1Writer ou Editorial. Et c\u2019est vraiment tr\u00e8s pratique ! Si on veut publier sur le web, on ajoute (ou on fait ajouter automatiquement par un logiciel) les balises HTML afin de mettre le texte en forme ou d'ajouter les liens, et mon exemple de texte donnerait ceci : <p>Pour cela, on peut aussi utiliser <a href=\"https://appsto.re/fr/GjYO.i\">1Writer</a> ou <a href=\"https://appsto.re/fr/UqWkO.i\">Editorial</a>.<br /> Et c'est vraiment <em>tr\u00e8s pratique</em> !</p> ```` Mais en Markdown, cela donnerait \u00e7a : ```html On peut aussi utiliser [1Writer](https://appsto.re/fr/GjYO.i) ou [Editorial](https://appsto.re/fr/UqWkO.i). Et c'est vraiment *tr\u00e8s pratique* ! C\u2019est plus \u00e9pur\u00e9 et on fait tout en une seule \u00e9tape. L\u2019\u00e9criture et la mise en forme. Votre WordPress saura afficher tout \u00e7a comme si c\u2019\u00e9tait du HTML. Pas convaincu ? Essayons avec un autre exemple. Vous avez d\u00e9j\u00e0 cr\u00e9\u00e9 une liste en HTML ?

Cependant, le Markdown ne s\u2019oppose pas au HTML. Comme le dit un de ses auteurs, \u00ab HTML is a publishing format ; Markdown is a writing format \u00bb. Il me semble qu\u2019\u00e0 l\u2019heure o\u00f9 on parle beaucoup de code \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9cole, ce langage n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 tellement popularis\u00e9 dans le monde de l\u2019\u00c9ducation (pas tellement plus que le HTML d\u2019ailleurs). Les enseignants qui \u00e9crivent beaucoup ont tout int\u00e9r\u00eat \u00e0 adopter ces langages (si tant est qu\u2019on puisse vraiment parler de langage d\u2019ailleurs). Vous publiez beaucoup ?

En ce qui me concerne, je trouve que Medium est un fabuleux terrain d\u2019\u00e9criture et de publication. Vous \u00e9crivez votre texte, vous le publiez. Du fait qu\u2019il s\u2019agit d\u2019un r\u00e9seau, vous n\u2019\u00eates pas seul.

Finalement, ce dont ils ont besoin, c\u2019est d\u2019une pratique r\u00e9guli\u00e8re de l\u2019ordinateur (ou de la tablette ou du smartphone).

Ce blog liste quelques-uns des points qu'il serait n\u00e9cessaire d'acqu\u00e9rir sans quoi le travail est rendu compliqu\u00e9 par les risques de perte ou les pertes de temps. Par exemple, son auteur s'\u00e9tonne \u00e0 juste titre de voir les \u00e9l\u00e8ves ignorer les touches fl\u00e9ch\u00e9es sur le clavier pour se d\u00e9placer dans un texte.

In fine, vous l\u2019aurez compris, l\u2019\u00e9l\u00e8ve initi\u00e9 au num\u00e9rique est un humaniste : faire preuve de jugement, savoir s\u2019exprimer \u00e0 l\u2019aide de diff\u00e9rents m\u00e9dias, d\u00e9fendre des id\u00e9es de partage, participer au d\u00e9veloppement de projets communs, devenir altruiste\u2026 Voil\u00e0 les objectifs qui me semblent \u00eatre ceux de l\u2019\u00e9cole num\u00e9rique.

Enfant, je regardais la s\u00e9rie Cosmos 1999 et je suivais le p\u00e9riple de ces voyageurs \u00e9gar\u00e9s qui, errant dans l\u2019espace, affrontaient toutes sortes de dangers. Et puis quelques ann\u00e9es plus tard, c\u2019est devenu la date \u00e0 laquelle je suis devenu enseignant. En y repensant, je me dis que l\u2019histoire du num\u00e9rique \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9cole est celle d\u2019une longue errance. \u00ab \u00c0 la d\u00e9rive \u00bb est d\u2019ailleurs le titre du premier \u00e9pisode de Cosmos 1999\u2026 Et il aura fallu de tr\u00e8s longues ann\u00e9es pour que le num\u00e9rique entre pour de bon \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9cole. Entr\u00e9e qui ne va pas sans certaines d\u00e9rives. On y reviendra. En 1999, quand j\u2019ai commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 enseigner, l\u2019utilisation d\u2019ordinateurs \u00e9tait d\u00e9j\u00e0 une pratique courante. Chaque coll\u00e8ge \u00e9tant dot\u00e9 d\u2019une salle d\u00e9di\u00e9e (on l\u2019appelait alors la \u00ab salle informatique \u00bb), le professeur et ses \u00e9l\u00e8ves s\u2019y rendaient apr\u00e8s avoir r\u00e9serv\u00e9 ladite salle. Ce n\u2019\u00e9tait pas toujours facile. La feuille sur laquelle on s\u2019inscrivait se trouvait le plus souvent au CDI, un coll\u00e8gue pouvait l\u2019avoir d\u00e9j\u00e0 r\u00e9serv\u00e9e (la salle, pas la feuille). En d\u2019autres occasions, vous pouviez avoir r\u00e9serv\u00e9 la salle mais un ind\u00e9licat s\u2019y \u00e9tait install\u00e9. Il fallait aussi avoir pr\u00e9venu les \u00e9l\u00e8ves et immanquablement un ou deux d\u2019entre eux erraient dans les couloirs jusqu\u2019\u00e0 ce qu\u2019ils prennent conscience du d\u00e9placement de la classe. Les retardataires allumaient ensuite leur ordinateur (qui bootaient p\u00e9niblement sur Windows 95 ou 98 puis, plus tard, XP dans les salles les plus modernes) et cela pouvait prendre quelques longues, longues minutes. Invariablement, un ou deux postes ne fonctionnaient plus et, un peu comme pour la table ronde des romans arthuriens, une place restait vacante et pouvait le rester pour de longs mois. Les r\u00e9parations rapides n\u2019ont jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 le lot de l\u2019\u00c9ducation nationale. On \u00e9tait donc en 1999 et cela faisait 14 ans que le \u00ab plan informatique pour tous \u00bb avait g\u00e9n\u00e9ralis\u00e9 ou tent\u00e9 de g\u00e9n\u00e9raliser le recours \u00e0 \u00ab l\u2019outil informatique \u00bb comme on disait alors\u2026 Je me souviens d\u2019ailleurs de la seule demi-journ\u00e9e de formation qui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 consacr\u00e9e \u00e0 \u00ab l\u2019informatique \u00bb \u00e0 l'attention des futurs professeurs qui apprenaient leur m\u00e9tier \u00e0 l\u2019IUFM : une initiation \u00e0 l\u2019utilisation du traitement de texte sur Word. On avait \u00e9crit un peu de texte, mis du gras et \u00ab appris \u00bb \u00e0 ins\u00e9rer une image (un chat) dans le corps du texte. C\u2019est tout. Et moi qui jouais \u00e0 Star Wars, \u00e0 bord de mon X-wing sur l\u2019ordinateur de mon grand-p\u00e8re au d\u00e9but des ann\u00e9es 80\u2026 Avec les ann\u00e9es, j\u2019avais m\u00eame fini par oublier que j\u2019aimais les ordinateurs\u2026 Je crois qu\u2019en fait une part incroyable des enseignants du secondaire avait tout simplement oubli\u00e9 que les ordinateurs existaient. On remplissait le cahier de textes \u00e0 la main et les bulletins aussi\u2026 L\u2019\u00e9l\u00e8ve que j\u2019\u00e9tais \u00e9tait d\u2019ailleurs compl\u00e8tement pass\u00e9 \u00e0 c\u00f4t\u00e9 de ce plan informatique pour tous\u2026 Quel rendez-vous manqu\u00e9 ! Pourtant, en 1999, on est en pleine r\u00e9forme du coll\u00e8ge. C'est une r\u00e9forme commenc\u00e9e en 1998 qui ambitionne de cr\u00e9er le \u00ab Coll\u00e8ge de l'An 2000 \u00bb bross\u00e9 par Fran\u00e7ois Dubet. Le bulletin officiel du 23 juin 1999 pr\u00e9cise quelques points et propose de \u00ab Donner acc\u00e8s \u00e0 tous \u00e0 la micro-informatique \u00bb : \u00ab Face \u00e0 un d\u00e9veloppement formidable des connaissances, le syst\u00e8me \u00e9ducatif doit se donner comme priorit\u00e9 de rendre l'\u00e9l\u00e8ve capable d'apprendre par lui-m\u00eame. Les technologies d'information et de communication constituent un moyen essentiel d'acc\u00e8s \u00e0 la connaissance \u00bb, \u00ab Il convient d'apprendre aux \u00e9l\u00e8ves \u00e0 savoir chercher des ressources utiles \u00bb, \u00ab Tout \u00e9l\u00e8ve devrait ma\u00eetriser des outils tels qu'un traitement de texte et l'usage d'Internet avant l'entr\u00e9e au lyc\u00e9e \u00bb (notez l'emploi du conditionnel qui sonne d\u00e9j\u00e0 comme une d\u00e9ception). Le bulletin officiel de 2001 (r\u00e9forme de Jack Lang) invite les principaux \u00ab \u00e0 mobiliser les \u00e9quipes p\u00e9dagogiques sur le \u00ab brevet informatique et internet \u00bb (B2i) \u00bb mis en place en novembre 2000. Le B2i \u00e9tait une attestation illustrant la capacit\u00e9 \u00e0 utiliser des outils informatiques. En 2004 (Luc Ferry est alors ministre de l'\u00c9ducation nationale), on entend \u00e0 nouveau \u00ab proposer \u00e0 tous les \u00e9l\u00e8ves la ma\u00eetrise des technologies de l\u2019information et de la communication (TIC) \u00bb. Notez cette fois l'apparition de l'acronyme TIC qui deviendra NTIC (Nouvelles Technologies de l\u2019Information et de la Communication) puis TICE (Technologies de l\u2019Information et de la Communication dans l'\u00c9ducation) et m\u00eame TUIC (Technologies Usuelles de l\u2019Information et de la Communication). En 2005, la circulaire datant de l'\u00e8re Fran\u00e7ois Fillon rappelle que \u00ab La ma\u00eetrise des TIC constitue un facteur de r\u00e9ussite d\u00e9terminant pour la poursuite des \u00e9tudes et l\u2019insertion dans la vie active de chaque \u00e9l\u00e8ve \u00bb. L\u00e0 encore, on souhaiterait mobiliser l'ensemble du corps enseignant : \u00ab les professeurs de toutes les disciplines ont vocation \u00e0 valider les comp\u00e9tences du B2i \u00bb. En 2008, le rapport Pochard remis au ministre Xavier Darcos signale \u00ab l'irruption massive \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9cole \u00bb des TIC qui \u00ab contribue non seulement \u00e0 bouleverser les formes d'acc\u00e8s des \u00e9l\u00e8ves au savoir, mais aussi \u00e0 faire \u00e9voluer profond\u00e9ment le contenu et les formes de l\u2019enseignement \u00bb. Le rapport rappelle l'int\u00e9gration des TIC au socle commun de connaissances et de comp\u00e9tences et poursuit : \u00ab Pour le moment, tous les enseignants ne participent pas de la m\u00eame fa\u00e7on \u00e0 ces \u00e9volutions. Certains r\u00e9sistent, d'autres se r\u00e9signent, beaucoup \u00e9voluent, mais personne n'y \u00e9chappe \u00bb. C'est d'ailleurs \u00e0 peu pr\u00e8s dans le m\u00eame temps que les enseignants ont l'obligation de remplir un cahier de textes d\u00e9sormais num\u00e9rique. En 2010, Luc Chatel lance un Plan de d\u00e9veloppement des usages du num\u00e9rique \u00e0 l'\u00c9cole. On se souvient de la phrase du ministre : \u00ab L'avenir de l'\u00e9cole ne s'\u00e9crira pas \u00e0 la craie sur un tableau noir \u00bb. Manifestement, la chose m\u00e9ritait d'\u00eatre rappel\u00e9e encore de nombreuses ann\u00e9es... Dans la foul\u00e9e de la refondation est cr\u00e9\u00e9e la Direction du num\u00e9rique pour l'\u00e9ducation qui \u00ab assure la mise en place et le d\u00e9ploiement du service public du num\u00e9rique \u00e9ducatif \u00bb... Vous voyez mieux ce que j'entends par errance ? Quoi qu\u2019il en soit, au moment o\u00f9 je me rends dans la salle informatique pour la premi\u00e8re fois de ma carri\u00e8re, je ne constate rien qui e\u00fbt pu m\u2019\u00e9tonner \u00e0 ce moment pr\u00e9cis. Ce n\u2019est qu\u2019en \u00e9crivant ces lignes qu\u2019il me revient \u00e0 la m\u00e9moire l\u2019\u00e9trange disposition des machines. Elles \u00e9taient toutes cal\u00e9es sur des tables pos\u00e9es le long du mur, si bien qu\u2019on avait une sorte de U avec au centre de la salle une b\u00e9ance, un vaste espace vide. Les \u00e9l\u00e8ves \u00e9taient alors invit\u00e9s \u00e0 se consacrer \u00e0 la t\u00e2che fix\u00e9e par l\u2019enseignant. C\u2019\u00e9tait donc un fonctionnement assez proche de ce qu\u2019on pouvait conna\u00eetre dans les salles traditionnelles de cours : des \u00e9l\u00e8ves effectuent des exercices et sont somm\u00e9s de se d\u00e9sint\u00e9resser du voisin. Mais, assez curieusement, la nature de l\u2019homme (enfin de l\u2019enfant) \u00e9tant ce qu\u2019elle est, les \u00e9l\u00e8ves, rendus plus proches les uns des autres par la proximit\u00e9 des ordinateurs, palliaient ce cloisonnement des activit\u00e9s par d\u2019in\u00e9vitables bavardages\u2026 L\u00e0 encore, on y reviendra. S\u00e9parer les \u00e9l\u00e8ves, les faire travailler sur un ordinateur et cela sans se pr\u00e9occuper de son voisin, telle \u00e9tait la t\u00e2che qui \u00e9tait fix\u00e9e, en l\u2019occurrence r\u00e9aliser des exercices d\u2019orthographe avec des logiciels comme Orthogram. C\u2019\u00e9tait l\u2019\u00e9poque o\u00f9 l\u2019on achetait des CD-ROM et Encarta de Microsoft \u00e9tait probablement le plus c\u00e9l\u00e8bre des exemples de ce type d\u2019usage. D\u2019ailleurs, en parent soucieux de l\u2019\u00e9ducation de mes propres enfants, j\u2019achetais moi-m\u00eame des logiciels, des jeux \u00e9ducatifs du type Adiboud\u2019chou ou Lapin Malin. Le modem 56 ko (le d\u00e9bit, ce grand coupable du d\u00e9samour enseignant pour la technique) \u00e9tait la norme et il n'\u00e9tait pas rare de recourir aux CD-ROM fournis par la presse sp\u00e9cialis\u00e9e pour d\u00e9couvrir de nouveaux programmes. En somme, des pratiques p\u00e9dagogiques avec l\u2019\u00e9tat de l\u2019informatique en 1999. Il n\u2019existait pas \u00e0 proprement parler de programmes grand public d\u00e9di\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9ducation. En tout cas, rien de commun avec la d\u00e9bauche de ce qu\u2019on appellera ensuite les \u00ab apps \u00bb et qui fleurissent sur les stores des GAFA : apps Montessori, apps d\u2019apprentissage de l\u2019\u00e9criture, apps pour apprendre l\u2019heure, pour faire des puzzles, pour d\u00e9couvrir de nouveaux livres, pour s\u2019initier \u00e0 la programmation\u2026 Et on avait tr\u00e8s peu de donn\u00e9es \u00e0 exploiter. Il fallait se pencher sur l\u2019\u00e9paule de l\u2019\u00e9l\u00e8ve pour observer ses r\u00e9ussites et ses \u00e9checs puis d\u00e9terminer sa progression. C\u2019\u00e9tait une sorte de p\u00e9riode artisanale o\u00f9 il fallait d\u00e9voyer certaines applications pour les utiliser dans le champ de l\u2019\u00e9ducation. Mais apr\u00e8s tout, c\u2019\u00e9tait encore le web 1.0. Les sites de l\u2019\u00e9poque \u00e0 l'esth\u00e9tique douteuse sur lesquels vous pouvez encore tomber de temps \u00e0 autre t\u00e9moignent de ce temps de gestation qui pr\u00e9c\u00e9dait \u00ab l\u2019\u00e8re du num\u00e9rique \u00bb. Sinon quoi d\u2019autre ? Dans ma pratique de professeur de fran\u00e7ais, pas grand-chose. Naturellement, l'ordinateur me permettait de ne plus faire de d\u00e9coupages de photocopies ni de collages. Ou alors de fa\u00e7on m\u00e9taphorique (le copier/coller...). Mais avec les \u00e9l\u00e8ves ? Les r\u00e9dactions \u00e9taient faites avec un traitement de texte. Un peu plus tard, dans les moments les plus fous, je faisais produire \u00e0 mes \u00e9l\u00e8ves un petit roman photo avec un parc h\u00e9t\u00e9roclite de machines tournant essentiellement sur Windows 95 (et sans internet). Mais c\u2019\u00e9tait bien tout. En somme, sortir de la classe traditionnelle pour utiliser l\u2019informatique est exceptionnel. Combien ce temps para\u00eet lointain et combien la pratique que je viens de d\u00e9crire para\u00eet \u00e9loign\u00e9e des enjeux \u00e9ducatifs qui sont aujourd'hui les n\u00f4tres. C\u2019est une petite fantaisie occasionnelle brisant la monotonie habituelle du cours traditionnel. Pourtant, beaucoup de choses commen\u00e7aient \u00e0 appara\u00eetre. Les exerciseurs avaient, avec Hot Potatoes, leur plus illustre repr\u00e9sentant. Les graveurs de CD, la multiplication des listes de diffusion, le d\u00e9veloppement d'internet inauguraient une fructueuse p\u00e9riode de partage. Certains enseignants faisaient concevoir \u00e0 leurs \u00e9l\u00e8ves des sites internet avec Dreamweaver ou Frontpage. Malgr\u00e9 cela, aujourd'hui, soit 30 ans environ apr\u00e8s le plan informatique pour tous, l\u2019enjeu est encore et toujours de \u00ab faire entrer l\u2019\u00e9cole dans l\u2019\u00e8re num\u00e9rique \u00bb. On remarquera au passage l\u2019abandon du mot \u00ab informatique \u00bb qui qualifiait le plan pr\u00e9c\u00e9dent. Ce changement lexical ne peut pas \u00eatre tenu pour anecdotique. \u00c0 lui seul, il indique quelles sont les ambitions \u00e9ducatives li\u00e9es au num\u00e9rique. Ces ambitions, \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re de ce nouveau plan, doivent \u00eatre interrog\u00e9es. Que signifie ce passage de l\u2019informatique au num\u00e9rique ? Et pourquoi serait-ce si profitable \u00e0 nos \u00e9l\u00e8ves ? Toutefois, il faut se garder de penser que l\u2019introduction du num\u00e9rique s\u2019impose comme une \u00e9vidence. On ne peut y r\u00e9pondre sans prendre en consid\u00e9ration les raisons qui font que le num\u00e9rique fait encore l'objet d'un rejet.","title":"1999"},{"location":"%C3%89criture/Un%20Centaure%20%C3%A0%20l%27%C3%A9cole/Avant-propos/","text":"Comment le num\u00e9rique change (et doit encore changer) l\u2019\u00e9cole, l\u2019\u00e9l\u00e8ve et le professeur \u00c0 mes \u00e9l\u00e8ves dont les \u00e9checs et les r\u00e9ussites ont nourri mes r\u00e9flexions \u00ab L\u2019ordinateur est pour moi l\u2019outil le plus remarquable que nous ayons cr\u00e9\u00e9.

S'est-elle consid\u00e9rablement transform\u00e9e \u00e0 travers les si\u00e8cles ou est-elle demeur\u00e9e inchang\u00e9e ? N'est-elle pas un peu comme ce bon vieux livre, cet ensemble de feuilles reli\u00e9es, qui selon Umberto Eco constitue une perfection ind\u00e9passable, comme le sont la roue ou la cuill\u00e8re 2 ? Un enseignant face \u00e0 des \u00e9l\u00e8ves dans une salle, n\u2019est-ce pas ainsi que l\u2019enseignement doit se pratiquer ? Une \u00e9cole dans laquelle on r\u00e9unit des \u00e9l\u00e8ves ayant \u00e0 peu pr\u00e8s le m\u00eame \u00e2ge, ayant plus ou moins le m\u00eame niveau et faisant la m\u00eame chose en m\u00eame temps, est-ce le mod\u00e8le qui peut perdurer ind\u00e9finiment dans le temps ? Comparer l'\u00e9tat de la m\u00e9decine avec celui de l'enseignement peut \u00eatre assez amusant (m\u00eame si de prime abord, on ne voit pas bien quel pourrait \u00eatre le rapport) et surtout nous permettre de r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 cette question. On peut se dire avec Fran\u00e7ois Taddei que \u00ab Si Pasteur revenait et voyait la m\u00e9decine aujourd\u2019hui, il verrait davantage de diff\u00e9rences que si Jules Ferry rentrait dans une \u00e9cole \u00bb 3 . Le rapprochement n'est pas nouveau. En prenant appui sur le tableau de Laurentius de Voltolina 4 , on a une petite id\u00e9e de la mani\u00e8re dont on faisait cours il y a plus de 600 ans. Mani\u00e8re qui est \u00e0 peu pr\u00e8s celle que l\u2019on peut observer dans bon nombre de salles de classe aujourd\u2019hui : un professeur fait cours \u00e0 une vingtaine d\u2019\u00e9l\u00e8ves assis en rang et dont une partie discute voire dort (ou peut-\u00eatre m\u00eame pleure). Si bien qu'il est tentant d'ironiser et de faire ce parall\u00e8le entre m\u00e9decine et enseignement. Et, de fait, un m\u00e9decin du XIVe si\u00e8cle voyageant dans le temps et qui arriverait dans notre si\u00e8cle serait perdu. Les mots st\u00e9thoscope, scanner, IRM, transfusion sanguine lui seraient inconnus et un h\u00f4pital serait un lieu incompr\u00e9hensible pour lui. En revanche, un enseignant ayant fait le m\u00eame voyage temporel n\u2019aurait qu\u2019\u00e0 se mettre devant ses \u00e9l\u00e8ves et prendre une craie. De 1350 \u00e0 aujourd\u2019hui, il n\u2019y aurait pas un gouffre insurmontable, si l\u2019on excepte une notable \u00e9volution linguistique... La plupart des salles de classe n\u2019ont pas beaucoup chang\u00e9 avec les ann\u00e9es. Un tableau, un bureau, des rang\u00e9es de tables\u2026 La Loi pour la refondation de l\u2019\u00e9cole enjoint pourtant les enseignants \u00e0 op\u00e9rer certaines transformations, des transformations qui, d'ailleurs, n\u2019ont pas attendu l\u2019injonction l\u00e9gislative pour \u00eatre mises en \u0153uvre. Simplement, la loi invite le corps enseignant dans son ensemble \u00e0 faire entrer le num\u00e9rique dans leurs pratiques. Le mot \u00ab num\u00e9rique \u00bb appara\u00eet, dans le texte de loi, 57 fois (\u00e0 titre de comparaison, le mot \u00ab \u00e9cole \u00bb compte 216 occurrences). C\u2019est dire l\u2019importance de la chose. Cependant le mot recouvre une notion tellement vaste qu\u2019il signifie tout et son contraire, le meilleur comme le pire. Car il faut admettre qu\u2019on nous rebat ad nauseam les oreilles avec le num\u00e9rique, et je ne suis pas toujours certain que cela soit \u00e0 bon escient. Pendant un temps - celui des pionniers, dit-on souvent - le num\u00e9rique ne me semblait pouvoir qu\u2019\u00eatre uniquement b\u00e9n\u00e9fique. Et les ann\u00e9es passant, je me suis souvent dit que bien des fois, le num\u00e9rique n\u2019apportait rien ou pas ce qu\u2019il aurait fallu qu\u2019il apporte. Or j\u2019ai r\u00e9cemment lu deux livres qui m\u2019ont litt\u00e9ralement boulevers\u00e9 et qui m\u2019ont, il me semble, aid\u00e9 \u00e0 mieux d\u00e9finir ce que le num\u00e9rique pouvait ou devait \u00eatre. Le premier est Smarter than you think de Clive Thompson qui montre comment la technologie nous rend plus intelligent ; le second est un livre d\u00e9j\u00e0 un peu moins r\u00e9cent, qui est L\u2019\u00c9l\u00e9ment de Ken Robinson, et qui montre combien l\u2019\u00e9cole \u00e9touffe sinon tue la cr\u00e9ativit\u00e9 des enfants. Formul\u00e9 ainsi, j\u2019ai bien conscience que le propos peut para\u00eetre excessivement simpliste, si ce n\u2019est carr\u00e9ment risible. Aussi le livre que vous lisez en ce moment est-il n\u00e9 du d\u00e9sir d\u2019illustrer ce double propos, de montrer comment le num\u00e9rique peut changer l\u2019\u00e9cole ou du moins accompagner l\u2019\u00e9cole dans des changements qu\u2019il est absolument impossible d\u2019\u00e9viter et cela au b\u00e9n\u00e9fice d\u2019\u00e9l\u00e8ves souvent somm\u00e9s de s\u2019asseoir, de se taire et \u00e9ventuellement d\u2019\u00e9couter (ou pas mais en silence). J\u2019avais aussi, \u00e0 l\u2019heure o\u00f9 le mot num\u00e9rique est omnipr\u00e9sent, un besoin d\u2019apporter la caution d\u2019une r\u00e9flexion. Bien s\u00fbr, je n\u2019ai pas d\u2019autre ambition que d\u2019apporter ma modeste pierre \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9difice, en l\u2019occurrence l\u2019objet de ma r\u00e9flexion (my two cents, comme disent les Am\u00e9ricains). J\u2019ai voulu tenter de l\u00e9gitimer l\u2019introduction du num\u00e9rique en classe. S\u2019il est souvent admis que le num\u00e9rique doit rentrer \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9cole, il faut bien voir que nombre d\u2019enseignants - et parmi eux de tr\u00e8s jeunes (ce ne sont donc pas les plus vieux qui sont r\u00e9fractaires \u00e0 des nouveaut\u00e9s qui n\u2019en sont plus) - s\u2019opposent cat\u00e9goriquement \u00e0 ce qu\u2019une machine interf\u00e8re dans leurs pratiques. Je me souviens de la premi\u00e8re formation que j\u2019ai effectu\u00e9e dans un coll\u00e8ge pr\u00e8s d\u2019Orl\u00e9ans. Tout \u00e0 ma joie de commencer ma premi\u00e8re formation, j\u2019arrive un peu en avance. Je me pr\u00e9pare, fais mes branchements dans ce coll\u00e8ge tout neuf dont tous les \u00e9l\u00e8ves et tous les enseignants ont \u00e9t\u00e9 fra\u00eechement \u00e9quip\u00e9s d\u2019iPad. Je m\u2019attends \u00e0 un grand moment de plaisir technophile. Un premier enseignant arrive. Il fait la t\u00eate. La raison : on lui a donn\u00e9 une tablette dont il n\u2019a que faire, il a une formation de plus\u2026 Bref il n\u2019est pas tr\u00e8s heureux d\u2019\u00eatre l\u00e0. Le num\u00e9rique semble lui apporter plus de tracas que de r\u00e9confort. Plus r\u00e9cemment, on m\u2019a dit deux fois \u00e0 quelques jours d\u2019intervalles : \u00ab Je ne vois pas ce que le num\u00e9rique peut apporter \u00e0 ma mati\u00e8re \u00bb. Or j\u2019ai une foi quasi in\u00e9branlable dans le num\u00e9rique. Ce qu\u2019il m\u2019a apport\u00e9 en tant qu\u2019enseignant est inestimable. Il a transform\u00e9 ma p\u00e9dagogie, m\u2019a amen\u00e9 \u00e0 produire des choses dont je ne me serais jamais cru capable. Il m\u2019a transport\u00e9 en des lieux - de Londres \u00e0 San Francisco en passant par Gen\u00e8ve - dans lesquels je n\u2019aurais jamais esp\u00e9r\u00e9 ni m\u00eame envisag\u00e9 \u00eatre invit\u00e9. Et m\u00eame dans les moments les plus futiles, par exemple en \u00e9crivant un tweet, j\u2019ai pu voir combien le num\u00e9rique nourrissait la r\u00e9flexion. Ainsi la pens\u00e9e naissait dans un simple gazouillis (ces quelque 140 caract\u00e8res parfois si d\u00e9consid\u00e9r\u00e9s), se transformait en un article de blog, lequel s\u2019enrichissait de commentaires. La r\u00e9flexion parvenue \u00e0 sa maturit\u00e9 (on l\u2019esp\u00e8re), celle-ci venait s\u2019\u00e9panouir dans un livre (on l\u2019esp\u00e8re aussi). Or ce b\u00e9n\u00e9fice que je tire du num\u00e9rique, je suis non seulement convaincu qu\u2019il peut \u00eatre profitable \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9l\u00e8ve mais qu\u2019il est urgent qu\u2019il le soit ! Voici donc ce dont il sera question dans ce livre. On verra comment l\u2019\u00e9l\u00e8ve aid\u00e9 de son ordinateur (ou d\u2019une tablette ou d\u2019un smartphone) en vient \u00e0 mieux travailler. On en profitera pour battre en br\u00e8che cette id\u00e9e du penseur isol\u00e9 \u00e0 la Rodin, seul en son esprit d\u2019o\u00f9 il d\u00e9gagera des merveilles. L\u2019\u00e9l\u00e8ve tel qu'on se le repr\u00e9sente commun\u00e9ment, tel un petit penseur pench\u00e9 sur son cahier \u00e0 grands carreaux, est un mythe qui n\u2019a pas lieu d\u2019\u00eatre et il faut le dire et le redire \u00e0 tous ceux qui s\u2019inqui\u00e8tent de l\u2019omnipr\u00e9sence de ces machines que nous portons sur nous. Ce que d\u2019aucuns qualifient de proth\u00e8ses n\u2019a rien d\u2019anxiog\u00e8ne. Elles n\u2019ont rien de nouveau. En effet, l\u2019homme consigne ses pens\u00e9es et ce dont il a besoin sur des supports externes depuis des milliers d\u2019ann\u00e9es. Cela s\u2019appelle l\u2019\u00e9criture, cela s\u2019appelle les livres. Pour l\u2019\u00e9l\u00e8ve, cela s\u2019appelle un cartable. On doit donc percevoir comment l\u2019\u00e9l\u00e8ve (mais aussi son enseignant) devient un individu augment\u00e9 (c\u2019est mieux que le proth\u00e9tique) par le num\u00e9rique. C\u2019est en somme une cr\u00e9ature hybride assist\u00e9e d\u2019un ordinateur et que les joueurs d\u2019\u00e9checs ont appel\u00e9 des centaures. Et de savoir ce qu\u2019est un centaure \u00e0 l'\u00e9cole. Cette notion d\u2019hybridit\u00e9, ne la retrouve-t-on pas dans notre quotidien. Par exemple dans notre \u00e9criture, m\u00ealant lettres \u00ab en attach\u00e9 \u00bb et caract\u00e8res d\u2019imprimerie ? Cet entrelacs de signes disparates ne r\u00e9v\u00e8le-t-il pas sans que l\u2019on n\u2019y ait pr\u00eat\u00e9 attention cette mutation qui a commenc\u00e9 bien avant que nos \u00e9l\u00e8ves, pour reprendre l'expression de Michel Serre, ne se transforment en petit(e) pouce(tte) ? Une fois cela dit, une fois \u00e9tabli ce substrat qu\u2019est cette modeste r\u00e9flexion, l\u2019on pourra montrer ce que doit \u00eatre le num\u00e9rique \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9cole. Il s\u2019agit en somme de se demander assez beno\u00eetement ce qu\u2019il apporte (et inversement ce qu\u2019il n\u2019apporte pas). Et j\u2019esp\u00e8re bien, au passage, fragiliser un peu cette m\u00e9fiance dont je parlais plus haut. Parfois, je parlerai de ce que font les \u00e9l\u00e8ves, de ce qu\u2019ils devraient faire et parfois j\u2019\u00e9voquerai mes propres pratiques d\u2019adulte, \u00e9tant bien entendu qu\u2019elles me sont personnelles (ne serait-ce qu\u2019en raison de mon \u00e2ge) mais qu\u2019\u00e0 un moment ou un autre, elles pourraient et devraient m\u00eame \u00eatre inculqu\u00e9es aux plus jeunes. Car c\u2019est bien d\u2019\u00e9ducation qu\u2019il s\u2019agit. L\u2019enseignant entend bien conduire (dans \u00ab \u00e9ducation \u00bb, il y a \u00ab ducere \u00bb = conduire) ses \u00e9l\u00e8ves quelque part (c\u2019est tout le sens de \u00ab \u00e9- \u00bb qui vient de \u00ab ex- \u00bb, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire \u00ab hors de \u00bb mais o\u00f9 ?). N\u2019y a-t-il pas tout un pan du num\u00e9rique qui \u00e9chappe \u00e0 nos \u00e9l\u00e8ves, car l\u2019\u00e9cole n\u2019a pas pris soin de l\u2019enseigner ? Ce livre peut aussi \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme une d\u00e9fense et illustration du num\u00e9rique ou du moins d\u2019un certain num\u00e9rique. De toute fa\u00e7on, me disait un jour un ami, on ne fait pas de barrage contre le Pacifique. Le num\u00e9rique \u00e9tant in\u00e9luctable, la question est de savoir comment l\u2019utiliser au mieux sans renoncer aux ambitions de l\u2019\u00e9cole. D\u00e8s lors, l\u2019on verra que tout change : l\u2019\u00e9cole, l\u2019\u00e9l\u00e8ve, le professeur. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ob_GX50Za6c \u21a9 N\u2019esp\u00e9rez pas vous d\u00e9barrasser des livres , entretiens d\u2019Umberto Eco et Jean-Claude Carri\u00e8re, Grasset, 2009 \u21a9 http://www.lopinion.fr/3-fevrier-2015/evolutions-majeures-qui-pourraient-faire-changer-monde-l-education-20946?utm_source=twitter&utm_medium=social&utm_content=Politique&utm_campaign=content \u21a9 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Laurentius_de_Voltolina_001.jpg \u21a9","title":"Avant propos"},{"location":"%C3%89criture/Un%20Centaure%20%C3%A0%20l%27%C3%A9cole/La%20panac%C3%A9e/","text":"Le num\u00e9rique n\u2019est pas la panac\u00e9e.

Ces natifs du num\u00e9rique s'opposeraient aux immigrants du num\u00e9rique (\u00ab digital immigrants \u00bb), d\u00e9nomination cens\u00e9e d\u00e9signer tous ceux qui ne seraient pas n\u00e9s avec le num\u00e9rique et qui ont d\u00fb s'adapter tant bien que mal au nouveau monde, en gardant des habitudes de l'ancien monde. Notez comme tout cela s'accorde bien avec l'histoire am\u00e9ricaine tout en r\u00e9actualisant (\u00e0 tort) la querelle des Anciens et des Modernes, ainsi que le remarque brillamment Divina Frau-Meigs : \u00ab C\u2019est un mythe des origines, tellurique, install\u00e9 dans le v\u00e9cu am\u00e9ricain de la fronti\u00e8re (le futur, l\u2019inconnu) et de l\u2019immigration (laisser le patrimoine derri\u00e8re soi). C\u2019est aussi un mythe des fins, mill\u00e9nariste, apparu au tournant du nouveau si\u00e8cle, alors que les \u00c9tats-Unis vivaient une s\u00e9rie de crises qui allaient culminer avec 9/11 (crise politique avec la remise en cause des \u00e9lections Bush/Gore, crise \u00e9conomique avec la peur du bug du mill\u00e9naire et l\u2019\u00e9clatement de la premi\u00e8re bulle num\u00e9rique\u2026). C\u2019est aussi une p\u00e9riode cl\u00e9 car elle marque la naissance de l\u2019internet politique suite aux attaques terroristes, apr\u00e8s l\u2019\u00e9mergence de l\u2019internet commercial en 1996 avec le passage de la loi des T\u00e9l\u00e9communications. C\u2019est un mythe par ses proportions inter-g\u00e9n\u00e9rationnelles de querelle des anciens et des modernes (natives et immigrants sont utilis\u00e9s au pluriel) : les modernes natifs sont sophistiqu\u00e9s et appuy\u00e9s par une technologie puissante tandis que les anciens immigrants sont mal pr\u00e9par\u00e9s et d\u00e9pass\u00e9s. Le tout fait crise, avec un substrat o\u00f9 la peur collective touche \u00e0 des valeurs profondes de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9, conditionnant son \u00e9volution, voire sa survie. \u00bb Je n\u2019ai jamais approfondi mes recherches afin de savoir de quelle fa\u00e7on s'est colport\u00e9 ce mythe (on sait cependant qu\u2019il est n\u00e9 sous la plume de Marc Prensky), mais il est facile de deviner combien il est faux. S\u2019il suffit de na\u00eetre au moment o\u00f9 une technique est popularis\u00e9e, je suppose qu\u2019\u00e0 d\u2019autres \u00e9poques, les enfants seraient tous n\u00e9s \u00e9lectriciens ou m\u00e9caniciens. Au reste, il suffit de voir ces jeunes apprentis du num\u00e9rique pour comprendre qu\u2019ils utilisent la technique comme tout un chacun, mais ils ne savent pas vraiment s\u2019en servir. Ils savent faire quelques petites choses qui ne requi\u00e8rent pas un grand savoir-faire et qui peut pourtant \u00e9tonner quelques personnes \u00e2g\u00e9es qui regardent tout \u00e7a en ouvrant de grands yeux, mais qui ne demandent pas un apprentissage forcen\u00e9. Tout au plus, j\u2019ai souvent \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tonn\u00e9 de voir chez certains enfants une capacit\u00e9 \u00e0 tester une interface sans la moindre appr\u00e9hension, alors que l\u2019adulte jette un regard anxiog\u00e8ne sur tout cela, paralys\u00e9 qu\u2019il est \u00e0 l\u2019id\u00e9e de faire une b\u00eatise. Et encore ! Combien de fois ai-je vu l\u2019inverse ! En fait, je ne suis pas m\u00eame s\u00fbr qu\u2019il existe une loi et encore moins un g\u00e8ne de l\u2019habilit\u00e9 num\u00e9rique chez l\u2019utilisateur. Et un jeune utilisateur a fortement besoin d\u2019une \u00e9ducation au num\u00e9rique sans quoi sa vie d\u2019adulte sera consid\u00e9rablement compliqu\u00e9e. Cependant, ce qui est int\u00e9ressant avec l'expression \u00ab digital native \u00bb, c'est qu'elle montre que les enfants qui naissent aujourd'hui (et depuis quelque temps d\u00e9j\u00e0) naissent dans un environnement num\u00e9rique. Comme le note Mark Prensky en exergue, \u00ab Students are not just using technology differently today, but are approaching their life and their daily activities differently because of the technology \u00bb. Tout dans leur vie est num\u00e9rique. Demain, nos \u00e9l\u00e8ves voteront sur leur t\u00e9l\u00e9phone ; aujourd'hui, ils s'appr\u00eatent \u00e0 payer avec ce m\u00eame appareil. Ils rencontreront peut-\u00eatre m\u00eame leur femme par ce truchement. On l'a dit \u00e0 de multiples reprises : tout est num\u00e9rique. En ce cas, qui songerait encore \u00e0 \u00e9crire une lettre sur du papier au lieu d'envoyer un e-mail ? \u00c9crire \u00e0 la main, faire un brouillon, le recopier, mettre la lettre dans une enveloppe, aller \u00e0 la poste et attendre une r\u00e9ponse ? Qui ou quel \u00e9l\u00e8ve voudrait cela si ce n'est pour le charme d'antan, le plaisir surann\u00e9 de la carte postale ? Je ne suis d'ailleurs pas s\u00fbr que l'on s'\u00e9merveille encore de l'imm\u00e9diatet\u00e9 de nos communications devenues num\u00e9riques. On ne les pr\u00e9sentera donc pas comme une \u00e9ni\u00e8me merveille suppos\u00e9e sauver l'\u00e9cole de la d\u00e9r\u00e9liction qui s'est empar\u00e9e d'elle, mais on reconna\u00eetra que l'\u00e9cole ne peut \u00e9chapper au num\u00e9rique. Et si l'\u00e9cole ne peut \u00e9chapper au num\u00e9rique, on notera tout de m\u00eame qu'un certain nombre d'\u00e9l\u00e8ves y ont \u00e9chapp\u00e9 et y \u00e9chappent encore. Or si l'on me permet de prendre les choses par le petit bout de la lorgnette et qu'on veuille bien s'\u00e9loigner des grands d\u00e9bats qui inscrivent notre \u00e9poque dans un clivage si difficilement identifiable, je ferai valoir combien l'\u00e9cole num\u00e9rique sans pr\u00e9tendre avec tr\u00e9molos dans la voix \u00e0 faire du monde \u00ab a better place \u00bb pourraient au moins tr\u00e8s simplement r\u00e9duire certaines injustices qui perdurent de fa\u00e7on incompr\u00e9hensible. Alors, certes, le num\u00e9rique n\u2019est pas la panac\u00e9e, et on peut avoir parfois le sentiment qu\u2019il est pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 comme tel, mais ce n\u2019est pas le cas. Cependant, le num\u00e9rique permet d\u2019\u00eatre plus juste. On ne supprimera pas certaines injustices scolaires, mais on peut au moins trouver quelques solutions \u00e0 des probl\u00e8mes qui n\u2019en avaient autrefois pas. Par le num\u00e9rique on ne r\u00e9soudra pas l\u2019enti\u00e8ret\u00e9 du probl\u00e8me de la difficult\u00e9 scolaire, mais on aura au moins contribu\u00e9 \u00e0 aider davantage ceux qui en ont besoin. Peut-\u00eatre la dyslexie est-elle une difficult\u00e9 que le num\u00e9rique peut sinon tenter de lever du moins aider \u00e0 surmonter. Si vous ne voyez pas bien de quoi il s\u2019agit, vous pouvez recourir \u00e0 ce petit plugin qui donnera \u00e0 n\u2019importe quelle page que vous lisez l\u2019apparence que peuvent rev\u00eatir les mots lorsque vous souffrez de dyslexie. Les lettres se mettent \u00e0 bouger, \u00e0 s\u2019intervertir, \u00e0 se m\u00e9langer. La dyslexie est donc un handicap qui vous emp\u00eache de lire correctement. Les lignes se m\u00e9langent. Les sons se confondent. Cons\u00e9quemment, la lecture est confuse, l\u2019acc\u00e8s au sens partiel et il faut d\u00e9penser une \u00e9nergie importante pour un r\u00e9sultat en dessous des esp\u00e9rances. On l\u2019a vu plus haut, en lisant sur un \u00e9cran, il est possible de changer la police. On a vu aussi le cas de l\u2019OpenDyslexic que l\u2019on trouve sur diff\u00e9rentes applications et notamment sur celle d\u2019Amazon, Kindle. On la retrouve \u00e9videmment sur Kobo mais encore sur OverDrive ainsi que sur Wikip\u00e9dia et m\u00eame Instapaper. Cette police a \u00e9t\u00e9 cr\u00e9\u00e9e par Abelardo Gonzalez qui a voulu qu\u2019elle soit gratuite. Elle est plus facile \u00e0 lire pour les personnes affect\u00e9es de dyslexie. Selon le site Lettres num\u00e9riques, \u00ab d\u2019une part, le bas des lettres est plus gras que le haut, ce qui permet de facilement reconna\u00eetre le sens d\u2019une lettre et de bien identifier chaque ligne de texte. D\u2019autre part, chaque lettre a une forme unique, ce qui facilite leur identification \u00bb. Mais on trouve bien plus qu\u2019une simple police. Il existe aussi des livres sp\u00e9cifiquement con\u00e7us pour les lecteurs dyslexiques. Ce sont des ePubs 3 et, au reste, tout ePub 3 correctement con\u00e7u devrait permettre \u00e0 un \u00e9l\u00e8ve en situation de handicap d\u2019acc\u00e9der au sens. Ce qui int\u00e9ressant avec Mobidys, c\u2019est qu\u2019elle propose des livres qui vont permettre \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9l\u00e8ve d\u2019espacer les caract\u00e8res et les lignes. En a\u00e9rant ainsi le texte, celui-ci devient plus lisible. Les syllabes peuvent aussi \u00eatre affich\u00e9es de diff\u00e9rentes couleurs. Et naturellement, le texte peut-\u00eatre lu (souvenez-vous de la fonction text-to-speech). \u00c0 l\u2019occasion de la journ\u00e9e mondiale de sensibilisation \u00e0 l\u2019autisme, Apple a mis en ligne une vid\u00e9o nous montrant comment la tablette peut aider certains enfants atteints de ce handicap. Ce spot (qu\u2019on n\u2019osera pas trop qualifier de publicitaire) montre comment un adolescent parvient \u00e0 communiquer avec les autres. Il est apparu que les autistes entretenaient une relation positive avec les machines. Et la presse n\u2019a pas manqu\u00e9 de s\u2019en faire l\u2019\u00e9cho, comme avec cet enfant pour lequel l\u2019assistant Siri est devenu son doudou. Le site Application autisme recense une centaine d\u2019applications ayant permis ou permettant \u00e0 des enfants autistes de communiquer ou de d\u00e9couvrir le monde. L\u2019un des principaux obstacles rencontr\u00e9s par les enfants autistes est l\u2019acquisition de la langue. Un autre obstacle est la difficult\u00e9 \u00e0 apprendre dans des domaines r\u00e9clamant un rapport \u00e0 autrui et donc \u00e0 interagir. C\u2019est ce double constat qui a conduit \u00e0 la cr\u00e9ation de classeurs de communication compos\u00e9s d\u2019images de la vie courante et d\u2019expressions fr\u00e9quemment utilis\u00e9es (ce sont les images issues du Picture Exchange Communication System utilis\u00e9 par les parents ou les \u00e9ducateurs depuis 1985). Ces supports visuels permettent aux enfants autistes de communiquer. Num\u00e9ris\u00e9s, ces supports ont constitu\u00e9 un nouvel obstacle, car la manipulation d\u2019une souris \u00e9tait difficile pour ces enfants. L\u2019apparition des interfaces tactiles a permis de lever l\u2019obstacle. Avec Grace App for Autism, l\u2019enfant interagit directement avec les pictogrammes sur l\u2019\u00e9cran. Leur recherche est plus rapide que dans les pages d\u2019un classeur et la synth\u00e8se vocale permet d\u2019entendre les mots ou les phrases cr\u00e9\u00e9s par l\u2019assemblage des pictogrammes. L\u2019enfant peut alors associer une image \u00e0 un son et r\u00e9aliser des progr\u00e8s linguistiques. Bien entendu, ces classeurs de communication ne s\u2019adressent pas uniquement aux seuls enfants autistes. Il est malheureusement de nombreuses autres raisons qui font que la communication n'est pas possible. C\u2019est le cas des personnes aphasiques ou victimes d\u2019un AVC (accident vasculaire c\u00e9r\u00e9bral) qui souffrent de troubles du langage. L\u2019application Comooty propose une collection d\u2019ic\u00f4nes parlantes issues de \u00ab photos prises dans l\u2019environnement du patient et associ\u00e9es \u00e0 des phrases enregistr\u00e9es par une voix famili\u00e8re \u00bb pour engendrer des phrases comme \u00ab Je veux boire un grand chocolat \u00bb ou \u00ab J\u2019ai mal \u00bb. \u00c9videmment, il ne suffit pas de placer une tablette entre les mains d\u2019un enfant autiste et la tablette suffit encore moins \u00e0 permettre l\u2019int\u00e9gration d\u2019un enfant handicap\u00e9 dans une classe. Le r\u00f4le de l\u2019enseignant, la pr\u00e9sence d\u2019une AVS (assistant de vie scolaire) sont infiniment plus importants. On pourra aussi r\u00e9torquer que l\u2019autisme ou la dyslexie ne touchent qu\u2019une infime partie du public scolaire, mais ce n\u2019est pas une raison pour ostraciser toute une partie des \u00e9l\u00e8ves (moins de 20% des \u00e9l\u00e8ves autistes sont scolaris\u00e9s au coll\u00e8ge en France). Prenons donc le cas d\u2019un handicap qui touche potentiellement tout \u00e9l\u00e8ve \u00e0 un moment de sa scolarit\u00e9. C\u2019est le cas de l\u2019accident. Et les enseignants savent que les absences, les pl\u00e2tres et les bandages sont monnaie courante dans nos \u00e9coles. Comment traite-on le probl\u00e8me m\u00eame occasionnel rencontr\u00e9 par ces \u00e9l\u00e8ves ? L\u2019an dernier, ma fille a\u00een\u00e9e s\u2019est cass\u00e9 le bras. Elle s\u2019est fait terriblement mal, n\u2019est pas all\u00e9e en classe et a manqu\u00e9 quelques jours de classe. Elle a d\u00fb alors rattraper les cours qu\u2019elle n\u2019avait pas suivis. Or la chose n\u2019est pas ais\u00e9e. Nombre d\u2019enseignants voudraient le croire ou vous expliqueront qu\u2019ils se d\u00e9brouillaient tr\u00e8s bien tout seuls quand ils \u00e9taient \u00e9l\u00e8ves. Pourtant il me semble que la plupart des difficult\u00e9s rencontr\u00e9es par un \u00e9l\u00e8ve qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 absent pourraient dispara\u00eetre si les cours des enseignants \u00e9taient en ligne. Et pour convaincre ces derniers, un certain nombre de points sont \u00e0 \u00e9claircir. En en \u00ab discutant \u00bb \u00e7\u00e0 et l\u00e0, j\u2019ai pu constater un premier quiproquo. Quand je dis \u00ab mettre les cours en ligne \u00bb, j\u2019entends par \u00ab cours \u00bb tout ce qui pourrait prendre place dans un cahier ou un classeur. Cela comprend les documents que l\u2019enseignant aurait pu photocopier ainsi que la le\u00e7on qu\u2019il a dict\u00e9e ou faite en classe, ce qu\u2019on nomme parfois si disgracieusement la \u00ab trace \u00e9crite \u00bb. Il va de soi que cette \u00ab trace \u00bb n\u2019est que le p\u00e2le reflet de ce qui fait toute la richesse d\u2019un cours : la strat\u00e9gie p\u00e9dagogique mise en \u0153uvre, les explications orales, les interventions des \u00e9l\u00e8ves, etc. \u00c0 moins qu\u2019on ne soit jusqu\u2019au-boutiste, on ne va pas aller tout de m\u00eame jusqu\u2019\u00e0 pas placer une webcam dans notre salle pour tout filmer et mettre sur YouTube ! Outre les probl\u00e8mes que cela pourrait poser (droits, poids du fichier\u2026), \u00e7a aurait un petit c\u00f4t\u00e9 NSA. Notez tout de m\u00eame que la chose serait assez ais\u00e9e : placez une tablette, allumez la cam\u00e9ra et diffusez. Il y aurait m\u00eame des solutions moins co\u00fbteuses en temps, comme utiliser une application comme Periscope, qui permet de diffuser en live. Je me demande m\u00eame si on ne pourrait pas confier la chose \u00e0 quelques \u00e9l\u00e8ves d\u00e9s\u0153uvr\u00e9s en \u00e9tude que l\u2019on pourrait convier \u00e0 filmer puis \u00e0 monter le cours auquel de facto ils seraient oblig\u00e9s de s\u2019int\u00e9resser, ne serait-ce qu\u2019en raison du go\u00fbt que ces \u00e9l\u00e8ves pourraient avoir pour la vid\u00e9o. Parfois, des enseignants \u00e9voquent leur salaire pour ne rien faire. J\u2019expliquerai ci-dessous comment mettre ses cours en 2 minutes chrono, mais quoi qu\u2019il en soit il faut bien admettre que le num\u00e9rique ne doit pas constituer n\u00e9cessairement une charge de travail (ce qui peut bien souvent \u00eatre le cas), mais au contraire aider l\u2019enseignant \u00e0 faire les choses mieux, plus vite et plus efficacement. Dans le cas contraire, \u00e0 quoi serviraient les machines ? Pourquoi avoir des ordinateurs ? Le cours en ligne ne se substitue \u00e9videmment pas au v\u00e9ritable cours (comment le pourrait-il ?), mais constitue un prolongement assez banal du processus d\u2019apprentissage, le m\u00eame qui fait qu\u2019un \u00e9l\u00e8ve poss\u00e8de un cahier. C\u2019est d\u2019ailleurs l\u00e0 la fonction de l\u2019\u00e9criture, celle de permettre d\u2019inscrire durablement les choses dans la m\u00e9moire. Rien de neuf depuis Socrate. Un \u00e9l\u00e8ve a besoin d\u2019apprendre lorsqu\u2019il rentre chez lui, et sa m\u00e9moire n\u2019\u00e9tant pas infaillible, il a besoin de noter ce qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 dit. Il peut avoir mal not\u00e9, il peut avoir oubli\u00e9 de noter quelque chose, il peut avoir mal compris, il peut n\u2019avoir pas not\u00e9 et ce sont alors les parents qui auront peut-\u00eatre besoin de savoir ce qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 not\u00e9, si d\u2019aventure l\u2019enfant essaie de se d\u00e9rober \u00e0 la charge de travail qui lui incombe. Et s\u2019il a \u00e9t\u00e9 absent, il n\u2019a \u00e9videmment rien not\u00e9 du tout. Il y a donc une r\u00e9elle n\u00e9cessit\u00e9, pour telle ou telle raison, de pouvoir acc\u00e9der au travail qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait. La technique le permettant ais\u00e9ment, il n\u2019y a aucune raison pour qu\u2019on ne donne pas cet acc\u00e8s. Cela d\u2019autant plus que le cours en ligne se partage, il se diffuse, il s\u2019enrichit des commentaires des visiteurs. Et en cela, il y a du neuf depuis Socrate : l\u2019\u00e9crit ne fixe plus une pens\u00e9e qui abandonne la richesse du dialogue. Vous pouvez alors nuancer, expliquer \u00e0 nouveau et m\u00eame vous corriger. Quand on partage un cours sur Evernote, par exemple, un \u00e9l\u00e8ve ou un parent peut \u00e0 tout moment poser une question. \u00c0 ce propos, je peux vous affirmer que depuis le temps que je donne mon adresse email, personne n\u2019en a abus\u00e9. Ma vie priv\u00e9e n\u2019est pas viol\u00e9e, perturb\u00e9e, envahie par le domaine professionnel. De temps \u00e0 autre, une question est pos\u00e9e : \u00ab Monsieur, c\u2019est bien \u00e7a qu\u2019il faut faire ? \u00bb, \u00ab Monsieur, c\u2019est bien ceci qu\u2019il fallait comprendre ici ? \u00bb, et c\u2019est \u00e0 peu pr\u00e8s tout, mais c\u2019est d\u00e9j\u00e0 beaucoup. Combien d\u2019erreurs ou de fausse-route \u00e9vite-t-on ? Les \u00e9l\u00e8ves pr\u00e9sents ont donc besoin de vous, mais si ceux-l\u00e0 ont ce besoin que dire des \u00e9l\u00e8ves qui n\u2019\u00e9taient pas l\u00e0 ? Les absents ont toujours tort. C\u2019est \u00e0 ce point que, d\u00e8s qu\u2019on parle d\u2019absent, on pense absent\u00e9isme. M\u00eame, parfois, ce dernier remplace le premier. On parle d\u2019absent\u00e9isme, comme on parle de technologie au lieu de technique, de probl\u00e9matique au lieu de probl\u00e8me, etc. L\u2019absent est suspect. O\u00f9 \u00e9tait-il ? \u00c9tait-il absent pour un v\u00e9ritable motif ? Pire encore. L\u2019enseignant estime bien souvent que l\u2019\u00e9l\u00e8ve doit se d\u00e9brouiller pour rattraper les cours. Il estime que c\u2019est LE travail de l\u2019\u00e9l\u00e8ve. Or rien n\u2019est plus faux. Voici pourquoi. Le travail de l\u2019\u00e9l\u00e8ve consiste \u00e0 apprendre, non pas \u00e0 d\u00e9nicher par tous les moyens le cours. L\u2019\u00e9l\u00e8ve qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 absent d\u00e9pense une \u00e9nergie consid\u00e9rable (non pas \u00e0 apprendre) mais \u00e0 contacter (par t\u00e9l\u00e9phone, mail, SMS voire les r\u00e9seaux sociaux) des \u00e9l\u00e8ves susceptibles de lui transmettre les cours. Cette transmission doit se faire le plus souvent avant la reprise des cours. L\u2019\u00e9l\u00e8ve s\u00e9rieux aura \u00e0 c\u0153ur d\u2019arriver en classe en ayant rattrap\u00e9 ce qu\u2019il a manqu\u00e9. Le weekend est donc d\u00e9volu \u00e0 une lente et parfois infructueuse recherche : tel \u00e9l\u00e8ve ne r\u00e9pond pas, tel autre ne donne qu\u2019une partie des devoirs. Celui-ci a oubli\u00e9 de transmettre telle info (\u00ab Au fait, d\u00e9sol\u00e9, j\u2019ai oubli\u00e9 de te dire que l\u00e0, y a contr\u00f4le \u00bb), celui-l\u00e0 a d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9ment omis de transmettre telle partie du cours, rivalit\u00e9 oblige. La photocopie est frapp\u00e9e d\u2019inanit\u00e9 : elle arrive quand l\u2019\u00e9l\u00e8ve est revenu. L\u2019\u00e9l\u00e8ve d\u00e9couvre ce qu\u2019il y avait \u00e0 faire pour le cours qui va \u00eatre fait. C\u2019est un non-sens. Le rattrapage des cours est une lutte contre le temps : l\u2019absent rattrape le pass\u00e9 pour suivre ce qui va se passer. Je crois que les choses sont assez compliqu\u00e9es, y compris pour un bon \u00e9l\u00e8ve, pour qu\u2019on ne le laisse pas se d\u00e9patouiller ainsi. On ne peut, pour maintes raisons susmentionn\u00e9es, s\u2019en remettre \u00e0 des \u00e9l\u00e8ves pour qu\u2019un rattrapage soit effectu\u00e9. C\u2019est un peu pour la m\u00eame raison que pour les devoirs : si on estime que c\u2019est hors de l\u2019\u00e9cole que le travail doit \u00eatre effectu\u00e9, on d\u00e9l\u00e8gue. On reconna\u00eet que le travail scolaire se fait hors de l\u2019\u00e9cole. C\u2019est, \u00e0 mon humble avis, un autre non-sens. Un peu comme si on demandait \u00e0 un boulanger de finir ses baguettes \u00e0 la maison\u2026 \u00c7a n\u2019a pas vraiment de sens. La direction, c\u2019est celle de l\u2019\u00e9cole, pas celle de la maison. L\u2019\u00e9cole se d\u00e9sint\u00e9resse de la question du rattrapage. Je dis l\u2019\u00e9cole comme je dirais l\u2019institution. Rien n\u2019est mis en place, rien n\u2019est organis\u00e9. On s\u2019en remet \u00e0 la seule bonne volont\u00e9 des uns et des autres, des \u00e9l\u00e8ves, des enseignants ou des parents. Dans le fond, l\u2019institution s\u2019en fiche un peu. C\u2019est peut-\u00eatre, entre autres, un peu pour \u00e7a que 150 000 jeunes sortent du syst\u00e8me scolaire sans qualification. Peut-\u00eatre qu\u2019une aide leur a fait d\u00e9faut, leur a certainement fait d\u00e9faut (je sais bien que tel ou tel enseignant se dira que certains \u00e9l\u00e8ves ne veulent rien faire\u2026 mais on n\u2019est pas oblig\u00e9 d\u2019avoir l\u2019\u00e9l\u00e8ve en suspicion). Ma fille a\u00een\u00e9e, toujours, a eu, apr\u00e8s une lourde op\u00e9ration du dos, huit mois d\u2019absence (l\u00e0, c\u2019\u00e9tait beaucoup plus grave que le coude cass\u00e9). Que propose l\u2019\u00c9ducation nationale ? Un peu de SAPAD qui n\u2019a pas eu lieu ? Un peu de CNED qui vous explique que quand vous \u00eates sous morphine, vous n\u2019\u00eates d\u00e9cid\u00e9ment pas tr\u00e8s productif ? En fait, seuls les coll\u00e8gues \u2013 mes merveilleux et super coll\u00e8gues que je ne remercierai jamais assez \u2013 se sont d\u00e9men\u00e9s, sont venus \u00e0 la maison, \u00e0 l\u2019h\u00f4pital pour apporter \u00e0 ma fille une aide qui plus est gratuite ! Chacun va donc se d\u00e9brouiller, faire comme il peut et on verra bien. Et que voit-on ? De l\u2019\u00e9chec scolaire. Quand on a rencontr\u00e9 les chirurgiens pour notre fille, c\u2019est la premi\u00e8re chose que l\u2019on nous a demand\u00e9e : quel est son niveau scolaire ? Car les difficult\u00e9s scolaires sont bien souvent le lot de tous ces nombreux \u00e9l\u00e8ves hospitalis\u00e9s. Je pr\u00e9cise que ma fille n\u2019a aucune difficult\u00e9 scolaire. Je le pr\u00e9cise, car je devine ais\u00e9ment qu\u2019on me reprocherait de l\u2019amertume, de l\u2019aigreur et qu\u2019on me suspecterait de ne m\u2019int\u00e9resser \u00e0 tout cela qu\u2019en raison des r\u00e9sultats de ma prog\u00e9niture. Mais ils sont tr\u00e8s bons, et l\u2019excellence scolaire est le fruit du travail, pas toujours facilit\u00e9, et en aucun cas des f\u00e9es qui se sont pench\u00e9es sur son berceau. Or il devrait exister une prise en charge des \u00e9l\u00e8ves absents, une vraie (pas un simulacre) quitte \u00e0 cr\u00e9er des emplois, ce qui me semblerait une bonne chose, non ? Parce qu\u2019il faut quand m\u00eame le reconna\u00eetre, le seul argument valable qui m\u2019ait \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9 sur Twitter quand j\u2019\u00e9voquais tout cela pour la premi\u00e8re fois, c\u2019est que l\u2019\u00e9l\u00e8ve a besoin d\u2019explications, d\u2019une v\u00e9ritable aide, pas seulement d\u2019une photocopie ou d\u2019un cours en ligne. Ne pouvant remonter le temps et ne b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiant que du seul cahier, l\u2019absent a manqu\u00e9 d\u2019importants moments. Ces moments ne peuvent \u00eatre r\u00e9cup\u00e9r\u00e9s que par un planning d\u00fbment organis\u00e9, mais un tel planning n\u2019existe pas ou peu. Il va aussi de soi qu\u2019une absence ponctuelle ne saurait avoir autant d\u2019impact que des absences r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e9es et que la prise en charge ne saurait \u00eatre la m\u00eame. En somme, le cours en ligne n\u2019est qu\u2019un pis-aller, mais c\u2019est toujours mieux que rien. Je disais au d\u00e9but de cet article que mettre ses cours en ligne prenait deux minutes. Voyons comment. Longtemps, j\u2019ai aim\u00e9 passionn\u00e9ment mettre les mains dans le cambouis, apprendre \u00e0 \u00e9crire une page web en HTML avec, forc\u00e9ment, du CSS et m\u00eame du JavaScript ou du PHP. \u00c7a devait flatter mon ego d\u2019enseignant que rien ne pr\u00e9parait \u00e0 cela, je voulais voir si je pouvais y parvenir. Et dans une sorte d\u2019hybris de newbie, je voulais tout faire moi-m\u00eame. Des ann\u00e9es apr\u00e8s, j\u2019ai un peu chang\u00e9 d\u2019avis. Mon site Ralentir travaux est devenu une grosse machine manquant de souplesse et je n\u2019ai pas forc\u00e9ment le temps n\u00e9cessaire \u00e0 lui consacrer. Qui plus est, je me suis mis \u00e0 \u00e9crire des livres (des ePubs). Mais cette fois, je ne m\u2019y suis pas laiss\u00e9 prendre. J\u2019utilise des logiciels, des apps comme on dit maintenant. Et c\u2019est fabuleux ! Je peux produire un tas de choses sans avoir \u00e0 \u00e9crire une seule ligne de code. C\u2019est d\u2019ailleurs pour \u00e7a que j\u2019estime que l\u2019enseignement de la programmation au coll\u00e8ge est superf\u00e9tatoire, mais la chose a d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9voqu\u00e9e\u2026 Bref, aujourd\u2019hui, je suis convaincu par ceci : mon job, c\u2019est d\u2019enseigner et le num\u00e9rique doit me permettre de faire les choses bien et rapidement. Pour cela, il y a pl\u00e9thore d\u2019applications. On parle d\u2019iTunes U, de Google for education, de Pronote, d\u2019ENT et de je ne sais trop quoi encore\u2026 Pour ma part, j\u2019utilise Evernote, et \u00e7a me change la vie. Evernote est une application de prise de notes. Je crois m\u00eame qu\u2019il est inutile de la pr\u00e9senter, mais sachez que cette application tient davantage du traitement de texte que de la petite application genre Notes sur iPhone. Vous trouverez une barre d\u2019outils offrant les principales options de formatage (choix de la police, taille, gras, italique, etc.). On peut m\u00eame faire des tableaux ! Les notes sont class\u00e9es dans des classeurs. J\u2019utilise donc Evernote en classe. J\u2019ai mon ordinateur, et au lieu d\u2019\u00e9crire au tableau, j\u2019\u00e9cris dans Evernote que je projette gr\u00e2ce au vid\u00e9oprojecteur que j\u2019ai la chance d\u2019avoir dans ma salle. Ainsi, le cours est d\u00e9j\u00e0 r\u00e9dig\u00e9. Un Mode pr\u00e9sentation permet de pr\u00e9senter le cours de fa\u00e7on plus lisible, plus s\u00e9duisante \u00e0 l\u2019\u0153il, un peu \u00e0 la fa\u00e7on d\u2019une pr\u00e9sentation Keynote ou PowerPoint, mais sans avoir \u00e0 refaire votre fichier texte pour le transformer en diapositive. C\u2019est un gain de temps \u00e9l\u00e9gant. De plus, en haut \u00e0 droite de l\u2019application, se trouve une option de partage. Le cours peut donc \u00eatre partag\u00e9 avec les \u00e9l\u00e8ves (comme vous partageriez un doc avec Dropbox ou Google Drive). Ceux-ci ou leurs parents m\u2019ont donn\u00e9 leur adresse mail (tout comme je leur donne la mienne). Et comme l\u2019application se synchronise automatiquement en ligne, quand mon cours est \u00e9crit, il est d\u00e9j\u00e0 sur internet. Les \u00e9l\u00e8ves absents, alit\u00e9s par exemple ou m\u00eame les parents un peu curieux peuvent suivre le cours en cours de r\u00e9daction. De plus, Evernote s\u2019installe partout : sur un Mac, sur un PC, sur un iPhone ou sur un Android ou un Windows Phone ou sur un navigateur. Je dois confesser que j\u2019aime beaucoup l\u2019id\u00e9e que mes \u00e9l\u00e8ves aient leur cahier dans la poche. Moi-m\u00eame, j\u2019ai mon bureau dans la poche. Je m\u2019ennuie en attendant mes filles qui font des emplettes chez S\u00e9phora ou H&M ? Je m\u2019assois dans un coin, sors mon t\u00e9l\u00e9phone, lance Evernote et je me mets \u00e0 r\u00e9diger quelques projets, \u00e0 commencer quelques cours. Remarquez que la fonction de partage ne se fait pas seulement entre professeurs et \u00e9l\u00e8ves ou parents, mais les \u00e9l\u00e8ves (s\u2019ils sont \u00e9quip\u00e9s d\u2019ordinateurs, de tablettes ou de leur propre t\u00e9l\u00e9phone) peuvent partager entre eux leurs cours. Je peux aussi avoir acc\u00e8s au cahier num\u00e9rique de mes \u00e9l\u00e8ves. Tout le temps, sans avoir rien \u00e0 ramasser. Et puis, il y a le chat ! On peut discuter avec les \u00e9l\u00e8ves ou les parents. On peut \u00e9claircir tel ou tel point. Quel temps gagn\u00e9 ! Que d\u2019erreurs \u00e9vit\u00e9es ! Evernote est un v\u00e9ritable cahier num\u00e9rique. Mes \u00e9l\u00e8ves dot\u00e9s d\u2019un ordinateur prennent leurs cours ainsi. Ils \u00e9crivent leurs cours ainsi. Leur cahier, c\u2019est Evernote. Ils \u00e9crivent, mais peuvent aussi ajouter des images. C\u2019est ce que je fais moi-m\u00eame. Je prends le tableau en photo et je mets les photos dans le cours. Ainsi, les choses vont tr\u00e8s vite. Il faut reconna\u00eetre que j\u2019ai la chance d\u2019avoir un double tableau : l\u2019un pour projeter, l\u2019autre pour \u00e9crire \u00e0 la main. Je peux alors profiter du meilleur des deux mondes num\u00e9rique et analogique. On joue sur les deux tableaux. Tandis que des consignes, des documents, le cours sont affich\u00e9s \u00e0 gauche, les \u00e9l\u00e8ves peuvent tout de m\u00eame se rendre au tableau et \u00e9crire. Parfois, il est d\u2019ailleurs plus simple d\u2019\u00e9crire \u00e0 la main, de faire un sch\u00e9ma \u00e0 main lev\u00e9e, etc. Pour ne pas avoir \u00e0 me faire des n\u0153uds au cerveau en me demandant comment retranscrire tout cela num\u00e9riquement, je prends donc le tableau en photo. Ainsi, je n\u2019ai m\u00eame pas \u00e0 recopier quoi que ce soit et les cours sont instantan\u00e9ment sur internet. On peut faire bien d\u2019autres choses encore. L\u2019enseignant ou l\u2019\u00e9l\u00e8ve peut annoter des images. C\u2019est la m\u00eame chose qu\u2019avec une app comme Skitch. On peut m\u00eame \u00e9crire \u00e0 la main ou dessiner quelques sch\u00e9mas. Les stylets \u00e9tant de mieux en mieux con\u00e7us, j\u2019y recours de plus en plus et notamment, on l\u2019a vu, pour la correction de copie. Il n\u2019est que la dict\u00e9e vocale pour faire un peu d\u2019ombre \u00e0 ce stylet qui consacre le retour de l\u2019\u00e9criture manuscrite. Pour diff\u00e9rentes raisons, cela m\u2019est arriv\u00e9 quelquefois d\u2019utiliser Siri en classe pour dicter le cours qui s\u2019affichait tout seul au tableau pendant que je circulais dans les rangs. On peut utiliser la fonction Enregistrer l\u2019audio de diverses mani\u00e8res. Je peux bien s\u00fbr l\u2019utiliser pour enregistrer ma propre voix. Ce peut aussi \u00eatre pour lire un po\u00e8me ou pour enregistrer une dict\u00e9e, mais je pr\u00e9f\u00e8re encore laisser cette possibilit\u00e9 \u00e0 mes \u00e9l\u00e8ves qui se sont transform\u00e9s r\u00e9cemment en petits journalistes et qui ont utilis\u00e9 Evernote comme un dictaphone pour enregistrer leurs interviews. Enfin, j\u2019ai pris l\u2019habitude de ne pas faire confiance au r\u00e9seau du coll\u00e8ge. J\u2019ai pris \u00e9galement l\u2019habitude de ne pas laisser les \u00e9l\u00e8ves errer vainement sur le web \u00e0 la recherche d\u2019infos. C\u2019est pourquoi, quand je donne un travail de recherches \u00e0 faire, je fais une s\u00e9lection des sites que les \u00e9l\u00e8ves devront visiter. \u00c0 cet effet, je place dans un carnet une s\u00e9lection de sites que les \u00e9l\u00e8ves liront. Mais mieux encore, je t\u00e9l\u00e9charge, aspire toutes les pages, vid\u00e9os, PDF que les \u00e9l\u00e8ves devront lire. Le carnet est partag\u00e9, les donn\u00e9es t\u00e9l\u00e9charg\u00e9es par les \u00e9l\u00e8ves (ou par moi) et on gagne un temps fou ! Bref, c\u2019est une tr\u00e8s belle application. Elle est multiplateforme et gratuite (seule la fonction Pr\u00e9sentation est r\u00e9serv\u00e9e au mod\u00e8le Premium), et je vous assure que je n\u2019ai aucune action dans l\u2019entreprise qui a cr\u00e9\u00e9 Evernote. D\u2019ailleurs, Microsoft avec OneNote d\u00e9veloppe une application similaire qui gagne de nouvelles fonctionnalit\u00e9s r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement. Ainsi, en mettant ses cours sur internet, on \u00e9vite quelques injustices susceptibles d\u2019\u00eatre r\u00e9solues en un rien de temps. On peut de la m\u00eame mani\u00e8re compter sur la technologie pour aider les \u00e9l\u00e8ves \u00e0 progresser en orthographe, notamment en diff\u00e9renciant notre p\u00e9dagogie. En tant que professeur de fran\u00e7ais, il m\u2019a toujours sembl\u00e9 que l\u2019apprentissage de l\u2019orthographe \u00e9tait un probl\u00e8me (je vous \u00e9pargne l\u2019\u00e9tat des lieux des connaissances scolaires des plus jeunes). Je me suis souvent demand\u00e9 comment le num\u00e9rique me permettrait de faciliter la t\u00e2che des \u00e9l\u00e8ves et comment \u00e9valuer leur orthographe, tant il est vrai que l\u2019ancestral recours \u00e0 la dict\u00e9e est d\u00e9sastreux surtout si ladite dict\u00e9e fait l\u2019objet d\u2019une note. Je ne voulais plus proposer \u00e0 mes \u00e9l\u00e8ves une dict\u00e9e unique que le seul enseignant que je suis d\u00e9livre \u00e0 l\u2019ensemble de la classe cens\u00e9e suivre comme un seul homme. Le num\u00e9rique apportant la possibilit\u00e9 d\u2019\u00eatre un peu plus soucieux des rythmes des uns et des autres, j\u2019ai opt\u00e9 depuis plusieurs ann\u00e9es pour la dict\u00e9e que j\u2019ai enregistr\u00e9e au format mp3. Chaque \u00e9l\u00e8ve fait alors la dict\u00e9e \u00e0 son rythme et \u00e0 son niveau. S\u2019il faut une heure \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9l\u00e8ve pour pr\u00e9parer sa dict\u00e9e, il prend une heure. S\u2019il peut la faire en 10 minutes, eh bien, c\u2019est parfait ! Il peut ensuite se consacrer \u00e0 autre chose. Cette dict\u00e9e est faite par un \u00e9l\u00e8ve (sur sa tablette ou sur l\u2019ordinateur). Il travaille seul ou avec son voisin, s\u2019il le souhaite. Je ne veux voir la dict\u00e9e que lorsqu\u2019elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00fbment corrig\u00e9e par l\u2019\u00e9l\u00e8ve lui-m\u00eame ou son groupe. Ainsi la m\u00e9thode est la suivante : l\u2019\u00e9l\u00e8ve \u00e9coute la dict\u00e9e, il l\u2019\u00e9crit puis il fait toutes sortes de v\u00e9rifications. La conjugaison des verbes est v\u00e9rifi\u00e9e dans le Bescherelle, le vocabulaire fait aussi l\u2019objet d\u2019une v\u00e9rification dans le dictionnaire (le Larousse en ligne par exemple). Certains \u00e9l\u00e8ves, notamment les plus en difficult\u00e9, trouvent un r\u00e9confort dans l\u2019utilisation d\u2019un traitement de texte, mais aussi dans un correcteur orthographique, qu\u2019il soit celui du traitement de texte ou ceux propos\u00e9s, entre autres, par Scribens ou le Bon patron. Ces derniers - souvent impuissants \u00e0 corriger tout un texte - fournissent des explications quant aux erreurs commises. Alors seulement, je regarde et corrige le texte avec le ou les \u00e9l\u00e8ves pour les aider \u00e0 corriger tel ou tel point qu\u2019il n\u2019est parvenu \u00e0 orthographier seul. Si le besoin s\u2019en fait ressentir, une correction peut-\u00eatre faite en classe avec un vid\u00e9oprojecteur en partant d\u2019une copie (d\u2019un volontaire naturellement) permettant de traiter des fautes les plus fr\u00e9quemment faites. La dict\u00e9e est photographi\u00e9e puis projet\u00e9e avec l\u2019application Explain everything. On peut l\u2019annoter, enregistrer m\u00eame la correction faite en classe au format vid\u00e9o et la mettre sur internet \u00e0 disposition des \u00e9l\u00e8ves. Une dict\u00e9e est, en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, assortie d\u2019exercices d\u2019approfondissement ou de r\u00e9visions. S\u2019il appara\u00eet qu\u2019il est n\u00e9cessaire de revoir le pass\u00e9 simple, l\u2019\u00e9l\u00e8ve peut relire la le\u00e7on ou faire des exercices interactifs que j\u2019ai pr\u00e9par\u00e9s. Enfin, la dict\u00e9e fait l\u2019objet d\u2019une \u00e9valuation. On voit ainsi ce qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 retenu et appris. Cumulant les dict\u00e9es, on poss\u00e8de alors un vivier de textes dans lesquels on pioche au hasard, l\u2019\u00e9l\u00e8ve devant \u00eatre capable \u2013 d\u00e9sormais \u2013 d\u2019\u00e9crire correctement n\u2019importe lequel d\u2019entre eux, ce qui n\u2019est pas rien quand on en a d\u00e9j\u00e0 fait une dizaine. Cette proposition de travail de l\u2019orthographe n\u2019est pas la panac\u00e9e, elle n\u2019apporte pas de solution miracle, elle n\u2019est pas non plus l\u2019unique et ultime solution. Simplement, il me semble que c\u2019est un moyen de faire, et que l\u2019\u00e9l\u00e8ve y trouve g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement son compte, car il travaille \u00e0 son rythme et selon ses difficult\u00e9s, tout en b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiant et de l\u2019aide qu\u2019apportent les logiciels et de l\u2019aide qu\u2019apportent ses voisins. De la m\u00eame fa\u00e7on, les ENT, la possibilit\u00e9 de consulter les notes de ses enfants, de lire le cahier de textes sans avoir \u00e0 se d\u00e9placer jusque dans l\u2019\u00e9tablissement, la possibilit\u00e9 enfin de discuter en ligne avec les enseignants permet de me suivre ses enfants, de comprendre ce qui est attendu d\u2019eux et de les aider, en tant que parents, \u00e0 faire leur travail. Mais vous connaissez tout cela, ces Espaces Num\u00e9riques de Travail ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 largement popularis\u00e9 depuis quelques ann\u00e9es. J\u2019aime aussi assez l\u2019id\u00e9e que le num\u00e9rique apporte un peu de confiance aux \u00e9l\u00e8ves. Le num\u00e9rique permet par exemple d'enregistrer des \u00e9l\u00e8ves timides qui, dans une relative intimit\u00e9, osent ainsi s\u2019exprimer, se mettre \u00e0 chanter par exemple. C\u2019est le cas de ces \u00e9l\u00e8ves film\u00e9es dans la tranquillit\u00e9 d\u2019une pi\u00e8ce s\u00e9par\u00e9e et qui ont superbement chant\u00e9. Inversement, je me souviens de cet \u00e9l\u00e8ve qui a eu 0,5 parce qu'il avait refus\u00e9 de chanter devant les autres. Le num\u00e9rique est un moyen de donner confiance en soi et si on n\u2019y est pas encore totalement parvenu, on peut pallier cette timidit\u00e9. Il n\u2019est pas rare que mes \u00e9l\u00e8ves investissent le couloir ou une salle libre en face pour enregistrer leurs travaux. Nous avons avec l\u2019application Plickers un autre exemple. L\u2019id\u00e9e est ing\u00e9nieuse : on peut faire de jolis tests, r\u00e9cup\u00e9rer et traiter une foule de donn\u00e9es, et tout cela avec le seul ordinateur de l\u2019enseignant (et de son t\u00e9l\u00e9phone). Ce qui m\u2019int\u00e9ressait, c\u2019\u00e9tait de d\u00e9terminer le niveau de ma classe, d\u2019avoir une estimation pr\u00e9cise des connaissances de tous les \u00e9l\u00e8ves sur un sujet donn\u00e9 (le verbe en l\u2019occurrence). J\u2019aurais pu proc\u00e9der \u00e0 une \u00e9valuation, mais je voulais quelque chose de plus\u2026 fun ! Quelque chose qui soit plus vivant, plus f\u00e9d\u00e9rateur qu\u2019une feuille de papier faisant office d\u2019\u00e9valuation formative que certains \u00e9l\u00e8ves auraient compl\u00e9t\u00e9 mollement. Or Plickers permet justement cela : les \u00e9l\u00e8ves participent all\u00e8grement. Et comme les r\u00e9sultats sont anonymes (si on le d\u00e9sire), personne n\u2019est paralys\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019id\u00e9e de dire ou d\u2019\u00e9crire une b\u00eatise monumentale. Et tout le monde de participer dans la joie et la bonne humeur ! Voil\u00e0 donc comment cela se passe. Tout d\u2019abord, dans votre navigateur, vous ajoutez votre classe et vos \u00e9l\u00e8ves. Un num\u00e9ro et donc une carte sont alors attribu\u00e9s \u00e0 vos \u00e9l\u00e8ves. Le chiffre 1 appara\u00eet aux quatre coins du carr\u00e9. C\u2019est donc la carte 1. C\u2019est cette carte qu\u2019il faudra donner \u00e0 votre \u00e9l\u00e8ve. L\u2019\u00e9l\u00e8ve num\u00e9ro 2 aura la carte num\u00e9ro 2, l\u2019\u00e9l\u00e8ve num\u00e9ro 3 la carte 3 et ainsi de suite\u2026 Vous pouvez r\u00e9cup\u00e9rer les cartes sur le site de l\u2019application. Vous les imprimez puis les distribuez \u00e0 vos \u00e9l\u00e8ves. Quand vous poserez vos questions aux \u00e9l\u00e8ves et que ceux-ci devront r\u00e9pondre, c\u2019est cette carte qui leur a \u00e9t\u00e9 attribu\u00e9e qu\u2019ils devront vous pr\u00e9senter. Le principe est simple. Si l\u2019\u00e9l\u00e8ve choisit la r\u00e9ponse A, il place la carte en mettant le A vers le haut, s\u2019il choisit la r\u00e9ponse B, il tendra la carte en pla\u00e7ant le B vers le haut et ainsi de suite\u2026 \u00c9videmment, pour pouvoir poser des questions \u00e0 vos \u00e9l\u00e8ves, il faut que vous les ayez cr\u00e9\u00e9es, et c\u2019est ce que vous aurez fait dans l\u2019onglet Library du site de Plickers. Quand vous avez cr\u00e9\u00e9 votre questionnaire, attribu\u00e9 les cartes aux \u00e9l\u00e8ves et que ceux-ci ont r\u00e9pondu, vous devrez alors scanner avec votre t\u00e9l\u00e9phone les r\u00e9ponses que vos \u00e9l\u00e8ves vous pr\u00e9sentent avec lesdites cartes qui ne sont rien d\u2019autre que des QR codes. L\u2019application reconna\u00eetra instantan\u00e9ment la r\u00e9ponse, le nom de celui qui l\u2019a donn\u00e9e et la traitera de fa\u00e7on \u00e0 vous indiquer qui a r\u00e9pondu quoi. Pour faire tout cela, vous avez besoin de votre ordinateur et de votre t\u00e9l\u00e9phone. Le premier est branch\u00e9 sur le vid\u00e9oprojecteur et indique la question et les r\u00e9ponses possibles et aussi qui a r\u00e9pondu et qui n\u2019a pas encore r\u00e9pondu. Pour pouvoir afficher cette question, vous avez besoin de votre t\u00e9l\u00e9phone. En effet, vous choisissez sur votre t\u00e9l\u00e9phone l\u2019une des questions que vous avez cr\u00e9\u00e9es. Puis sur votre ordinateur, vous allez dans l\u2019onglet Live View. Selon la qualit\u00e9 de votre connexion, votre question appara\u00eet, les \u00e9l\u00e8ves en prennent connaissance et peuvent choisir la r\u00e9ponse A, B (ou C, D ou E). Vous pilotez donc le questionnaire \u00e0 partir de votre t\u00e9l\u00e9phone et, en un sens, l\u2019ordinateur ne sert plus que d\u2019\u00e9cran d\u2019affichage. Quand tout le monde a r\u00e9pondu, votre t\u00e9l\u00e9phone sert ensuite \u00e0 scanner les r\u00e9ponses de vos \u00e9l\u00e8ves. C\u2019est tr\u00e8s bien fait et l\u2019appareil reconna\u00eet la r\u00e9ponse de l\u2019\u00e9l\u00e8ve m\u00eame au fond de la classe. Ensuite vous avez des statistiques (dans l\u2019onglet Reports). Vous voulez savoir qui n\u2019a pas r\u00e9ussi telle ou telle question ? Eh bien, par exemple, cliquez sur le chiffre 3 de la premi\u00e8re question qui indique que trois \u00e9l\u00e8ves ont choisi une r\u00e9ponse erron\u00e9e (la r\u00e9ponse D). Vous saurez qui c\u2019est, et qui a donc besoin d\u2019une aide suppl\u00e9mentaire. Apr\u00e8s, il m\u2019a sembl\u00e9 opportun de faire le point. Une sorte de brainstorming. J\u2019ai demand\u00e9 aux \u00e9l\u00e8ves : \u00ab Dites-moi tout ce que vous avez retenu d\u00e8s lors que l\u2019on parle de conjugaison \u00bb. On a rassembl\u00e9 toutes les r\u00e9ponses dans un nuage de mots fait avec Wordsalad. Ce nuage sert de moyen mn\u00e9motechnique. C\u2019est la trace de tout ce qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9voqu\u00e9. Ensuite, on constitue des groupes de 3 ou 4 \u00e9l\u00e8ves qui vont devoir r\u00e9diger la le\u00e7on sur le verbe. Ils ont la charge de tout rassembler, reprendre et r\u00e9sumer de fa\u00e7on claire et intelligible ce qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 dit (lors de la phase du questionnaire, des explications ont parfois \u00e9t\u00e9 demand\u00e9es), avec des exemples. En somme, ils doivent se transformer en enseignants qui ont la charge de transmettre une le\u00e7on sur le verbe. Si vos \u00e9l\u00e8ves ont des iPad, ils peuvent r\u00e9aliser eux-m\u00eames et tr\u00e8s facilement quelques vid\u00e9os avec Spark Video par exemple. La conclusion, on la devine ais\u00e9ment. Tout le monde a particip\u00e9 sans h\u00e9sitation ni crainte et m\u00eame avec joie. Tout le monde est actif. Le travail en groupe permet m\u00eame le tutorat. Je trouve qu\u2019ainsi mes le\u00e7ons de grammaire retrouvent un peu de fra\u00eecheur. Le num\u00e9rique permet donc de faire que tout le monde participe, ce qui n\u2019\u00e9tait auparavant pas possible, comme dans les conf\u00e9rences et notamment en amphith\u00e9\u00e2tre. Ainsi les \u00e9tudiants n\u2019osent pas forc\u00e9ment lever la main devant 400 personnes et encore moins interroger un enseignant qui, du haut de sa chaire, n\u2019a pas pour habitude d\u2019\u00eatre questionn\u00e9, contrairement \u00e0 ce qui peut se passer dans les TD d\u2019une universit\u00e9 dont les ma\u00eetres de conf\u00e9rences ont la charge. D\u2019o\u00f9 l\u2019id\u00e9e d\u2019utiliser Twitter. Bruno Dondero, un professeur de droit, annonce le th\u00e8me de son cours sur Twitter, envoie des liens vid\u00e9o \u00e0 consulter et propose \u00e0 ses \u00e9tudiants de poser des questions via Twitter durant le cours. Et l\u2019enseignant de r\u00e9pondre de vive voix. Celui-ci devient plus accessible et les \u00e9tudiants sont plus concentr\u00e9s. La r\u00e9cente introduction de Q&A (questions & answers) par Google dans son application Slides va dans le m\u00eame sens. Slides est le PowerPoint de la firme de Mountain View. En permettant aux conf\u00e9renciers et donc aux enseignants de r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 des questions de l\u2019auditoire ou de la classe, on offre \u00e0 ces derniers la possibilit\u00e9 d\u2019interagir bien s\u00fbr, mais aussi et surtout de participer sans appr\u00e9hension, sans craindre de devoir lever la main devant tout le monde ou de prendre le micro devant des centaines de personnes et m\u00eame d\u2019\u00e9viter que la parole ne soit mobilis\u00e9e par des personnes qui, au contraire, aiment se mettre en avant. Une autre fois, j\u2019\u00e9tais confront\u00e9 \u00e0 des \u00e9l\u00e8ves qui ne parvenaient pas \u00e0 commencer leur r\u00e9daction. Ils devaient r\u00e9diger un conte et n\u2019avaient probablement pas d\u2019id\u00e9es. Ils ne devaient pas avoir cette culture du conte qui leur permettait de fa\u00e7on implicite de comprendre les consignes et de se dire : \u00ab L\u00e0, il va me falloir un adjuvant pour aider le h\u00e9ros qui va ainsi obtenir un objet magique qui l\u2019aidera dans sa qu\u00eate \u00bb. En utilisant l\u2019application Decide Now, je me suis efforc\u00e9 de trouver une solution \u00e0 cette paralysie litt\u00e9raire momentan\u00e9e. Decide Now est en fait une roue virtuelle, un peu comme la roue de la fortune dans le jeu t\u00e9l\u00e9vis\u00e9 du m\u00eame nom. On la fait tourner et on lit la case o\u00f9 elle s\u2019est arr\u00eat\u00e9e. Cette roue ou plut\u00f4t ces roues car j\u2019en avais fait plusieurs contenaient tous les ingr\u00e9dients du conte. Ainsi une roue proposait diff\u00e9rents lieux \u00e0 traverser : un ch\u00e2teau, une grotte, un souterrain, une for\u00eat, des montagnes, une rivi\u00e8re\u2026 Une autre proposait divers objets magiques : une baguette magique, une clef enchant\u00e9e, un anneau qui rend invisible, un tapis volant, des bottes de sept lieues, le pouvoir de se faire oublier\u2026 Et la m\u00eame chose pour les p\u00e9rip\u00e9ties, la r\u00e9compense, la moralit\u00e9, les personnages, etc. En fait, les \u00e9l\u00e8ves avaient juste besoin qu\u2019on leur mette le pied \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9trier. Et une fois qu\u2019on leur avait procur\u00e9 de fa\u00e7on amusante (je ne dirais pas ludique, parce que je ne suis pas s\u00fbr que \u00e7a l\u2019\u00e9tait vraiment) les \u00e9l\u00e9ments constitutifs du conte, ils pouvaient laisser aller leur imagination et commencer leur r\u00e9daction. Il en allait de m\u00eame avec des applications du type Spritz, une application qui utilise le Rapid Serial Visual Presentation. Concr\u00e8tement, l\u2019application n\u2019affiche qu\u2019un mot \u00e0 la fois contenant une lettre rouge cens\u00e9e fixer votre attention en un point pr\u00e9cis. Cette m\u00e9thode doit pouvoir vous apprendre \u00e0 lire tr\u00e8s vite. Elle n\u2019est pas nouvelle et date des ann\u00e9es 70. Vous trouverez une flop\u00e9e d\u2019applications utilisant cette m\u00e9thode. J\u2019ai pour ma part retenu Litz pour sa capacit\u00e9 \u00e0 lire des ePubs. Mais il faut bien reconna\u00eetre que ce n\u2019est pas la solution la plus plaisante (en tout cas pour moi qui lis et aime \u00e0 lire lentement). Cependant, pour des textes plus courts, de ces articles qui ont donn\u00e9 naissance au terme \u00ab infob\u00e9sit\u00e9 \u00bb, une telle fa\u00e7on de lire peut vous permettre d\u2019entamer votre course contre la montre des textes \u00e0 lire dans la journ\u00e9e. Mais dans le cadre scolaire, il peut \u00eatre int\u00e9ressant de pr\u00e9senter aux \u00e9l\u00e8ves cette application. J\u2019ai vu beaucoup de lecteurs bons et moins bons se jeter goulument sur l\u2019application pour lire de plus en plus vite et d\u00e9passer leur nombre de mots par minute. 150, c\u2019est d\u00e9j\u00e0 beaucoup ! Surtout \u00e0 voix haute. Mais encore une fois, le d\u00e9fi, l\u2019aspect ludique sont une invitation \u00e0 surmonter ses h\u00e9sitations, ses appr\u00e9hensions, ses craintes. Ce que l\u2019on voit, par tous ces exemples, c\u2019est que le num\u00e9rique apporte une diversit\u00e9 de bon aloi, une fra\u00eecheur qui aident les \u00e9l\u00e8ves r\u00e9calcitrants et qui ne le sont peut-\u00eatre qu\u2019en raison de la monotonie des travaux effectu\u00e9s depuis des ann\u00e9es. Le dernier exemple que j\u2019ai pris, illustrant l\u2019apprentissage de la lecture, montre que l\u2019on peut travailler des comp\u00e9tences telles que l\u2019acquisition de la lecture et donc sans rien raboter des exigences traditionnelles (le sempiternel lire, \u00e9crire, compter\u2026), mais en variant les approches et m\u00eame en rendant les choses un peu amusantes, ce qui correspond assez \u00e0 ce que l\u2019on tente de faire avec les serious games. Cependant, il n\u2019y a pas que la p\u00e9dagogie qui change. L\u2019enseignant lui-m\u00eame acquiert une nouvelle posture. Son r\u00f4le dans l\u2019\u00e9cole irradie la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 dans laquelle, plus que jamais, sa voix r\u00e9sonne. J\u2019en veux pour exemple la p\u00e9tition lanc\u00e9e par Fran\u00e7oise Cahen qui, dans un article intitul\u00e9 \u00ab Les couilles du bac litt\u00e9raire \u00bb, laissait entendre son indignation : il n\u2019est aucun \u00e9crivain f\u00e9minin au bac de terminale litt\u00e9raire. Aucune femme, aucune auteure. Jamais. N\u2019ayant obtenu le droit de vote qu\u2019en 1944, les femmes vivraient encore et toujours dans l\u2019ombre des hommes ? D\u2019o\u00f9 l\u2019id\u00e9e de lancer une p\u00e9tition dans laquelle l\u2019enseignante \u00e9crit : \u00ab Nous ne demandons pas la parit\u00e9 entre artistes hommes et femmes. Nous aimerions que les grandes \u00e9crivaines comme Marguerite Duras, Mme de Lafayette, Annie Ernaux, Marguerite Yourcenar, Nathalie Sarraute, Simone de Beauvoir, George Sand, Louise Lab\u00e9... soient aussi r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement un objet d'\u00e9tude pour nos \u00e9l\u00e8ves. \u00c0 un type de classe compos\u00e9 en majorit\u00e9 de filles et des profs de lettres qui sont majoritairement des femmes, quel message subliminal veut-on faire passer ? \u00bb. La presse tout enti\u00e8re s\u2019est faite l\u2019\u00e9cho de cette juste demande. Pr\u00e8s de 20 000 personnes ont appos\u00e9 leur signature et Najat Vallaud-Belkacem, la ministre de l\u2019\u00c9ducation, a elle-m\u00eame laiss\u00e9 un commentaire et approuv\u00e9 la p\u00e9tition.","title":"La panac\u00e9e"},{"location":"%C3%89criture/Un%20Centaure%20%C3%A0%20l%27%C3%A9cole/Le%20code%20et%20autres%20modes/","text":"Il s'est install\u00e9 dans l'esprit des gens une dr\u00f4le d'id\u00e9e, celle que les enfants devaient apprendre \u00e0 coder. \u00ab Il faut apprendre \u00e0 coder le plus t\u00f4t possible. Je suis pour le PHP au primaire \u00bb, affirmait le PDG de BlaBlaCar. Un homme politique en campagne pr\u00e9sentant son programme d\u00e9clarait : \u00ab Je veux ... des cours de codage d\u00e8s l'\u00e2ge de six ans \u00bb. Selon un sondage de 2014, 87 % des personnes interrog\u00e9es se disent pour l\u2019enseignement du code. \u00c0 la m\u00eame \u00e9poque, les propos d\u2019Axelle Lemaire, la secr\u00e9taire d'\u00c9tat charg\u00e9e du Num\u00e9rique, tendent \u00e0 montrer qu\u2019il y a l\u00e0 une n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 soci\u00e9tale, les emplois \u00e0 venir requ\u00e9rant cette comp\u00e9tence qui fait si cruellement d\u00e9faut \u00e0 nos enfants. Il semble donc se d\u00e9gager une sorte de consensus autour de la question. Dans tous ces exemples, l\u2019usage du singulier me saute aux yeux : coder, \u00ab codage \u00bb (sic), enseignement du code\u2026 Je suppose qu\u2019il y a l\u00e0 une analogie avec le code de la route : il y aurait un code \u00e0 apprendre, mais rien n\u2019est si \u00e9loign\u00e9 de la r\u00e9alit\u00e9. Il y a tant de codes ! Et puis, je remarque l\u2019emploi absolu du verbe : coder quoi ? On ne sait pas, il n\u2019y a g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement pas de compl\u00e9ment d\u2019objet. Ce peut \u00eatre tout et n\u2019importe quoi. Peut-\u00eatre cela n\u2019importe-t-il d\u2019ailleurs pas. L\u2019important est de coder ! Je veux bien reconna\u00eetre que j\u2019ergote un peu. On dit bien, apr\u00e8s tout, apprendre \u00e0 lire. \u00c0 lire quoi ? On ne le dit pas non plus, mais c\u2019est parce que la suite va de soi. On va apprendre \u00e0 lire des textes sur quelque support que ce soit. Mais ce n\u2019est pas du tout \u00e9vident pour le verbe coder. Les possibilit\u00e9s sont immenses et je me demande s\u2019il est vraiment raisonnable d\u2019orienter de jeunes \u00e9l\u00e8ves vers un apprentissage qui peut un jour s\u2019av\u00e9rer caduc. Qui aurait soup\u00e7onn\u00e9 il y a 15 ans que le Flash finirait par \u00eatre honni ? D\u2019ailleurs, dans les exemples que j\u2019ai donn\u00e9s, est \u00e9voqu\u00e9 l\u2019apprentissage du PHP. On peut discuter longtemps de la pertinence de ce choix, mais la destination de son enseignement \u00e0 des enfants de six ans suffit \u00e0 elle seule \u00e0 condamner une telle proposition. Comment des enfants qui ne savent pas \u00e9crire vont-ils inscrire des instructions plut\u00f4t abstraites et qui plus est en anglais ? C\u2019est tout simplement impossible ! M\u00eame \u00e0 14 ans, nombre de mes \u00e9l\u00e8ves \u00e9crivent avec un doigt sur le clavier. J\u2019imagine ceux de 6 ans \u00e0 la recherche des raccourcis clavier permettant de coder\u2026 L\u2019apprentissage du code est pourtant passionnant. Il faut en convenir. Le livre Computer Science Unplugged dont la version fran\u00e7aise est un petit tr\u00e9sor r\u00e9dig\u00e9 \u00e0 l'attention des plus jeunes (d\u00e8s l'\u00e9cole primaire). On leur montre comment \u00ab pense \u00bb un ordinateur, comment tout ce qu'il affiche (textes, formes, images...) n'est en fait compos\u00e9 que de 0 et de 1. Il n'y a m\u00eame pas, comme l'indique le titre (unplugged = d\u00e9branch\u00e9), besoin d'ordinateur. On peut ainsi initier les enfants \u00e0 la pens\u00e9e informatique (\u00ab computational thinking \u00bb) avec quelques feuilles de papier. Mais comment enseigner tout cela, en se contentant de greffer ici de l'algorithmie, l\u00e0 un peu d'initiation ? Il faudrait cr\u00e9er une nouvelle mati\u00e8re. Est-ce r\u00e9ellement possible ? De plus, je suis persuad\u00e9 qu\u2019un usage pr\u00e9coce serait contreproductif, en tout cas au primaire et probablement au coll\u00e8ge. Si on veut bien admettre qu\u2019un \u00e9l\u00e8ve n\u2019a aucune id\u00e9e qu\u2019un logiciel puisse \u00eatre autre chose que WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get), vous comprendrez que l\u2019urgence n\u2019est pas \u00e0 la notion de variable ni m\u00eame de programmation. Encore qu\u2019on pourrait envisager une s\u00e9lection pr\u00e9coce des enfants : les litt\u00e9raires d\u2019un c\u00f4t\u00e9, les scientifiques de l\u2019autre, mais ce n\u2019est pas ce qu\u2019on veut. On veut des scientifiques qui ont des id\u00e9es, des scientifiques litt\u00e9raires en somme, des ing\u00e9nieurs ing\u00e9nieux sachant s\u2019exprimer et d\u00e9velopper des projets. C\u2019est certes une bonne chose que les \u00e9l\u00e8ves voient ce qu\u2019il y a derri\u00e8re le rideau (the man behind the curtains) et qu\u2019ils comprennent comment fonctionnent ces machines que nous utilisons tant, mais il faudra se fixer des objectifs raisonnables. En fait, on peut simplement vouloir apprendre aux \u00e9l\u00e8ves quelques rudiments, les initier \u00e0 l\u2019algorithmie. C\u2019est ce que font nombre d\u2019enseignants avec un programme comme Scratch, d\u00e9velopp\u00e9 par le MIT \u00e0 l\u2019attention des plus jeunes. Et les enseignants qui utilisent ce programme le disent tous. C\u2019est une formidable initiation \u00e0 la programmation et au d\u00e9veloppement de la logique. Avec Scratch, on peut cr\u00e9er de petits programmes et on peut m\u00eame recr\u00e9er un des anc\u00eatres du jeu vid\u00e9o comme Pong. En cr\u00e9ant le programme, on \u00e9tudie les angles et s\u2019il y a la moindre erreur, le programme ne fonctionne pas. L\u2019\u00e9l\u00e8ve s\u2019en rend imm\u00e9diatement compte et cherche l\u2019erreur, une erreur qu\u2019il sait exister, qu\u2019il ne peut pas manquer de voir et dont il n\u2019aurait m\u00eame pas eu conscience avec un travail plus traditionnel. Et surtout on am\u00e8ne l\u2019\u00e9l\u00e8ve \u00e0 consid\u00e9rer que l\u2019erreur est normale. Comme me le disait Samuel Chalifour, \u00ab Aucun informaticien ne code sans erreur. On code, on lance, on corrige, on relance, etc. \u00bb. Ken Robinson nous rappellerait alors qu'on ne peut pas \u00eatre cr\u00e9atif en ayant la crainte de se tromper. Pour cr\u00e9er, il faut accepter les erreurs. C'est ainsi que l'on trouvera son chemin (le mot \u00ab erreur \u00bb est de la m\u00eame famille que \u00ab errer \u00bb, du latin \u00ab errare \u00bb, aller \u00e7\u00e0 et l\u00e0, marcher \u00e0 l'aventure). Cependant il me semble que cet apprentissage ne concerne qu\u2019une partie de la population. Il est certes int\u00e9ressant que l\u2019on ait tous des connaissances qui nous permettent de mieux comprendre les machines, mais tous nos \u00e9l\u00e8ves ne seront pas d\u00e9veloppeurs. Je trouve qu\u2019il y a l\u00e0 une quasi-sp\u00e9cialisation un peu inutile alors que tous nos \u00e9l\u00e8ves qu\u2019ils soient d\u00e9veloppeurs ou boulangers ou chef d\u2019entreprise auront besoin de savoir \u00e9crire, de savoir d\u00e9busquer des informations, de travailler en \u00e9troite collaboration avec les uns et les autres, etc. Or pas un enseignant ne se plaint de la boursouflure gargantuesque du programme. Les ambitions de l\u2019\u00e9cole tiennent un peu de la gourmandise intellectuelle de Grangousier \u00e9crivant \u00e0 son jeune fils, \u00e0 ceci pr\u00e8s qu\u2019on ne veut plus enseigner l\u2019h\u00e9breu ni le grec, mais \u00ab le code \u00bb. Et c\u2019est bien aux langues que l\u2019on compare l\u2019apprentissage du code : \u00ab On apprend l\u2019anglais, le chinois, il faut apprendre \u00e0 coder ! \u00bb, nous disait Alexandre Lemaire. Vous remarquerez, au passage, \u00e0 quel point on fait fi de la distinction saussurienne entre langue et langage, comme si c\u2019\u00e9tait une seule et m\u00eame chose. Au reste, si l\u2019on veut absolument consacrer du temps \u00e0 l\u2019apprentissage du code, je me demande vraiment o\u00f9 on va le placer dans l\u2019emploi du temps d\u2019\u00e9l\u00e8ves d\u00e9j\u00e0 tr\u00e8s occup\u00e9s. Quelles mati\u00e8res devront \u00eatre sacrifi\u00e9es sur l\u2019autel de la modernit\u00e9 ? Le latin, le fran\u00e7ais, la SVT ? Peut-\u00eatre aussi la r\u00e9forme a-t-elle partiellement r\u00e9pondu \u00e0 cette question\u2026 Si l\u2019on doit couper dans le tas, je souhaiterais alors que les choses soient tr\u00e8s claires : disons aux parents, aux \u00e9l\u00e8ves, aux associations que le niveau ne baisse pas, il change. On forme les enfants selon des imp\u00e9ratifs qui varient selon les \u00e9poques. Et, enfin, si enseignement du code il doit y avoir, il me semblerait \u00eatre un formidable bond en arri\u00e8re. \u00c0 l\u2019heure o\u00f9 Thomson revient sur la sc\u00e8ne commerciale, tout cela n\u2019est pas sans rappeler le Plan informatique pour tous. Faut-il rappeler les raisons de son \u00e9chec ? A-t-on d\u00e9j\u00e0 oubli\u00e9 ? Or c\u2019est bien l\u00e0 le probl\u00e8me. Il me semble qu\u2019il y a bien plus urgent qu\u2019enseigner un code, tant la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 d\u2019initier au num\u00e9rique est urgente. De ce point de vue, il faut battre en br\u00e8che l\u2019id\u00e9e que l\u2019apprentissage du code est n\u00e9cessaire. Veut-on cr\u00e9er un site ? A-t-on besoin d\u2019apprendre le HTML, le CSS ou le JavaScript (ni langue ni langage d\u2019ailleurs) ? Franchement, \u00e0 part pour le d\u00e9fi intellectuel que cela repr\u00e9sente, pour assouvir la passion qui peut en d\u00e9couler, non. Je le sais, je l\u2019ai fait. Dans un sursaut d\u2019orgueil, j\u2019ai mis mon site \u00e0 la poubelle, et je l\u2019ai refait enti\u00e8rement avec mes petites mains et mon \u00e9diteur de texte. \u00c7a a \u00e9t\u00e9 un d\u00e9fi, \u00e7a m\u2019a passionn\u00e9 et me passionne toujours, mais aujourd\u2019hui, je le regrette. Il me serait plus confortable d\u2019utiliser un CMS. Je gagnerai un temps fou, comme je gagne beaucoup de temps \u00e0 d\u00e9marrer ma voiture ou utiliser mon micro-onde sans comprendre le moins du monde ce qu\u2019il se passe \u00e0 ce moment. La vulgate voudrait que l\u2019utilisateur passe de consommateur \u00e0 acteur, comme si l\u2019apprentissage du code allait, comme l\u2019assurent certaines personnes, vous permettre de modifier un smartphone. Croit-on vraiment cela ? Vous voyez une g\u00e9n\u00e9ration d\u2019utilisateurs modifiant \u00e0 la main le firmware de leur routeur, codant au passage une blagounette en assembleur \u00e0 destination de la NSA ? Soyons s\u00e9rieux. Et d\u2019o\u00f9 vient cette passion pour le software ? Pourquoi personne n\u2019insiste sur la ma\u00eetrise du hardware ? Pourquoi ne mettrions-nous pas un fer \u00e0 souder entre les mains de nos enfants ? Parce que c\u2019est impossible voire superf\u00e9tatoire. \u00c0 moins de faire miroiter \u00e0 notre coll\u00e9gien la confection d\u2019un smartphone de 15 pouces\u2026 La seule raison qui me ferait admettre l\u2019enseignement du code, ce serait pour des motifs purement intellectuels, pour la rigueur, l\u2019apprentissage de la logique, pour la culture, pour le fun, mais pas sous des pr\u00e9textes fallacieux de geek en herbe. Que l\u2019on nous \u00e9pargne cette vision complaisante pr\u00e9sentant les gamins comme de petits hackers ne demandant qu\u2019\u00e0 \u00eatre \u00e9veill\u00e9s, toisant l\u2019industrie californienne de leur sup\u00e9riorit\u00e9 \u00e0 venir. Voil\u00e0 une forme d\u2019hybris num\u00e9rique, en somme. Et surtout que l\u2019on \u00e9quipe les \u00e9tablissements d\u2019abord, que l\u2019on s\u2019acquitte du n\u00e9cessaire ensuite (\u00e9duquer au num\u00e9rique), et que l\u2019on all\u00e8ge les programmes avant de les alourdir \u00e0 nouveau. Apr\u00e8s, pourquoi pas, laissons-les coder. Mais si l\u2019on met la charrue avant les b\u0153ufs \u2013 je prends les paris \u2013 l\u2019apprentissage d\u2019un quelconque code suscitera autant de passion que l\u2019accord du participe pass\u00e9. Cet engouement pour le code me semble donc \u00eatre une mode. Or il en est d\u2019autres qui, pour int\u00e9ressantes qu\u2019elles soient, me paraissent incompatibles avec la richesse induite par le num\u00e9rique. C\u2019est pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment le cas de la classe invers\u00e9e. Dans le fond, je n\u2019ai pas grand-chose contre ce type d\u2019approche. Je crois m\u00eame que certains enseignants font de tr\u00e8s belles choses. Cependant, j\u2019en go\u00fbte peu le principe. Je regrette qu\u2019on ajoute quelques devoirs \u00e0 des \u00e9l\u00e8ves fort peu d\u00e9sireux de les faire. Michel Guillou ajouterait que certaines capsules (le mot n\u2019est d\u00e9cid\u00e9ment pas tr\u00e8s joli) sont fort m\u00e9diocres. Mais si la chose vous pla\u00eet, qu\u2019ai-je \u00e0 dire ? Inversez si tel est votre bon plaisir. En revanche, je suis fort surpris de l\u2019engouement m\u00e9diatique provoqu\u00e9 par la classe invers\u00e9e. Et \u00e0 dire vrai, on nous rebat les oreilles avec la classe invers\u00e9e. On a eu le droit \u00e0 une d\u00e9bauche d\u2019articles et de reportages sur le sujet tant et si bien qu\u2019on avait l\u2019impression que le num\u00e9rique \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9cole, c\u2019\u00e9tait l\u2019inversion de la classe. Moi-m\u00eame, j\u2019ai eu quelques vell\u00e9it\u00e9s. C\u2019est dire ! Comprenez-moi bien. Ce n\u2019est pas tant le principe de la classe invers\u00e9e qui m\u2019agace (c\u2019est m\u00eame int\u00e9ressant dans le fond), c\u2019est la surm\u00e9diatisation et la surrepr\u00e9sentation du sujet dans les conversations, les conf\u00e9rences et autres grands raouts d\u00e9di\u00e9s au num\u00e9rique. C\u2019est qu\u2019au bout du compte, on a le sentiment que le num\u00e9rique se r\u00e9duit parfois \u00e0 la classe invers\u00e9e. En fait, cette classe invers\u00e9e fait vraiment flipper (d\u00e9sol\u00e9 pour la m\u00e9diocrit\u00e9 du jeu de mots qui doit certainement \u00eatre \u00e9cul\u00e9) : c\u2019est une mode, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire un go\u00fbt collectif et passager, en l\u2019occurrence, pour un domaine de la p\u00e9dagogie. C\u2019est donc une mode ennuyante, qui occulte (en pr\u00e9sentant une pratique comme \u00e9tant la solution) d\u2019autres pratiques tout aussi int\u00e9ressantes et, comme toute chose exer\u00e7ant une fascination, elle est bien peu compatible avec la r\u00e9flexion. Mais peut-\u00eatre que ma coll\u00e8gue Aur\u00e9lie Gascon a raison quand elle affirme que le probl\u00e8me, c'est que la p\u00e9dagogie est souvent peu spectaculaire et que cela favorise certaines pratiques plus \u00ab photog\u00e9niques \u00bb. D\u2019o\u00f9 les modes. Il y a donc des p\u00e9dagogies qui passent mieux que d\u2019autres, des pratiques plus photog\u00e9niques que d\u2019autres. Les moches sont pri\u00e9s de laisser les m\u00e9dias tranquilles. C\u2019est dommage parce que la vari\u00e9t\u00e9 induite par le num\u00e9rique est pass\u00e9e sous silence. Or, pour moi, le num\u00e9rique m\u2019apparait comme le lieu de tous les possibles. C\u2019est ce qui me frappe quand j\u2019ouvre le livre de Ghislain Domin\u00e9 Les TICE en classe. Il y a tant de choses \u00e0 faire (y compris inverser la classe), mais il n\u2019y a pas que \u00e7a ! Seulement un certain nombre de pratiques ne doivent pas \u00eatre photog\u00e9niques et elles n\u2019int\u00e9ressent pas les m\u00e9dias et ne trouvent pas leur place l\u00e9gitime dans les discussions qui se produisent sur les r\u00e9seaux. C\u2019est finalement quelque peu inqui\u00e9tant : la p\u00e9dagogie serait, hormis les quelques exemples auxquels justement je m\u2019en prends, peu rago\u00fbtante. C\u2019est peut-\u00eatre pour cela que les enseignants dits innovants sont pronum\u00e9riques. Il faut croire que ceux-ci sont tri\u00e9s sur le volet et que les autres sont pri\u00e9s de rester dans l\u2019ombre. Or combien sont formidables, avec pour seul arsenal que leur seule personne, leur imagination et leur savoir-faire (m\u00eame avec une craie) ? Lisez L\u2019\u00c9l\u00e9ment de Ken Robison, vous en trouverez de tr\u00e8s beaux exemples. J\u2019ai \u00e9t\u00e9 fascin\u00e9 par cet exemple d\u2019une classe mise au centre d\u2019une maison de retraite. On peut faire tant de choses avec si peu de paillettes num\u00e9riques ! Quoi qu\u2019il en soit, je me suis rendu compte que la petite sph\u00e8re d\u2019enseignants hyperconnect\u00e9e fonctionnait par cycle : \u00e0 un moment, il fallait absolument que les \u00e9l\u00e8ves tweetent (ce qui est fort bien au demeurant) ; ensuite on a eu le droit au code (c\u2019est extr\u00eamement bien cependant) ; plus r\u00e9cemment, on ne pouvait plus enseigner sans Minecraft (\u00e7\u2019a l\u2019air bien aussi) ; et il y a l\u2019ineffable classe invers\u00e9e ( qui donne lieu \u00e0 plein de bonnes choses aussi par ailleurs). On a donc, par p\u00e9riodes, des obsessions p\u00e9dagogiques qui parfois se chevauchent, se croisent, s\u2019annulent, en occultent d\u2019autres. Mais enfin, il est de ces moments o\u00f9 il n\u2019est plus question que de ceci ou de cela. Vous ouvrez votre timeline, votre flux RSS, votre Flipboard et paf ! Minecraft ici, Minecraft l\u00e0 ! Minecraft partout ! Minecraft toujours ! Je comprends d\u00e9sormais les r\u00e9ticences de certains enseignants peu port\u00e9s sur les 0 et les 1. Go\u00fbtant peu les joies du num\u00e9rique, ils en sont d\u00e9go\u00fbt\u00e9s avant m\u00eame d\u2019avoir commenc\u00e9, tant on leur rebat les oreilles avec certaines pratiques qu\u2019ils sont somm\u00e9s d\u2019admirer. Pri\u00e8re de s\u2019\u00e9merveiller pourrait pr\u00e9c\u00e9der chaque article portant sur le num\u00e9rique et la p\u00e9dagogie. Tout se passe comme si le m\u00e9lange du num\u00e9rique et de la p\u00e9dagogie reproduisait dans certains cas cette fascination li\u00e9e aux \u00e9crans. On regarde, \u00e9baubi, et on ne pense plus. On est dans l\u2019enthousiasme avec tout ce que le mot comporte de religieux. Je me demande m\u00eame si on (oui, vous aurez remarqu\u00e9 que je me mets dans le lot) n\u2019est pas les adorateurs d\u2019un dieu vide et factice. Il y a m\u00eame quelque chose de vici\u00e9 dans cette pr\u00e9sentation de merveilles num\u00e9rico-p\u00e9dagogiques. Pour les pr\u00e9senter, rappelait Fran\u00e7ois Lamoureux sur Twitter, on recourt au bon vieux cours magistral. Notez le paradoxe : pour montrer ce qui bat en br\u00e8che le cours magistral, on recourt au cours magistral. Mais revenons-en aux antiennes m\u00e9diatiques. Que pr\u00eachent-elles ? Eh bien, on l\u2019a vu, il faut apprendre \u00e0 coder. On emploie \u00e0 tort et \u00e0 travers diff\u00e9rentes expressions : le codage ou encore l\u2019emploi absolu du verbe coder. C\u2019est la m\u00eame chose avec la classe invers\u00e9e. On met l\u2019accent sur le dispositif mais pour quoi faire ? Eh bien on n\u2019en parle jamais ! Ah certes, on parle de m\u00e9thode. On parle d\u2019applications pour faire des capsules ! Mais du contenu ? Jamais ! De ce que l\u2019\u00e9cole doit transmettre ? Jamais. Hormis en cas d\u2019attentats, les valeurs sont rel\u00e9gu\u00e9es au second plan. \u00c7a me rappelle tr\u00e8s nettement la critique de Tzvetan Todorov sur l\u2019enseignement de la litt\u00e9rature dans le secondaire et sa capacit\u00e9 \u00e0 instrumentaliser les textes pour faire \u00e9tudier ici une m\u00e9taphore, l\u00e0 un emploi verbal. Mais de l\u2019homme, de ce que l\u2019\u0153uvre a \u00e0 dire, \u00e0 transmettre ? Jamais. On a m\u00eame le sentiment que l\u2019accident l\u2019emporte sur l\u2019essence. Par exemple, dans l\u2019enseignement du fran\u00e7ais, il est souvent question de slam. Et la presse de s\u2019\u00e9merveiller ! Un enseignant fait produire \u00e0 ses \u00e9l\u00e8ves un slam ! On voit bien que l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat se d\u00e9place : on est davantage int\u00e9ress\u00e9 par un enseignement qui ferait \u00e9tudier Baudelaire et qui le moderniserait en le transposant en slam. On met en avant le slam qui a permis \u00e9ventuellement d\u2019\u00e9tudier Baudelaire. Il m\u2019arrive ainsi de penser que l\u2019on m\u00e9rite la virulence de certaines critiques du camp adverse (ceux qui se disent r\u00e9publicains par opposition \u00e0 nous autres p\u00e9dagos). Car enfin il est vrai que de savoir, de connaissance, de discipline, il n\u2019est nulle question. Ou en tout cas pas assez. Et je voudrais r\u00e9affirmer que toutes ces techniques, ces outils, ces dispositifs, ces moyens mis en \u0153uvre ne sont que les efforts de l\u2019enseignant pour transmettre son amour des sciences ou de la litt\u00e9rature. Il ne faudrait donc pas confondre la fin et les moyens. Loin de moi l\u2019id\u00e9e de penser que des enseignants font mal leur travail, qu\u2019ils ne s\u2019interrogent pas ou qu\u2019ils n\u2019en sont pas venus tout seuls aux m\u00eames conclusions que moi, mais le maelstr\u00f6m m\u00e9diatique laisse accroire que l\u2019important, c\u2019est de coder tout court, d\u2019inverser et puis c\u2019est tout, de tweeter et il en restera bien quelque chose. Moi-m\u00eame, j\u2019ai embrass\u00e9 tout cela, mais \u00e7a ne peut pas constituer l\u2019essentiel du m\u00e9tier d\u2019enseignant, ce que Franck Amadieu et Andr\u00e9 Tricot formulent tr\u00e8s bien : \u00ab La technologie n\u2019est pas en soi un dispositif p\u00e9dagogique \u00bb.","title":"Le code et autres modes"},{"location":"%C3%89criture/Un%20Centaure%20%C3%A0%20l%27%C3%A9cole/Le%20num%C3%A9rique%20en%202016/","text":"17 ans apr\u00e8s, l\u2019omnipr\u00e9sence du num\u00e9rique n\u2019\u00e9chappe \u00e0 personne. Pardon pour la banalit\u00e9 du discours, mais on voit bien que le num\u00e9rique est partout. En 2016, quand un b\u00e9b\u00e9 na\u00eet, il se vend environ deux iPhone. Le num\u00e9rique assiste notre venue au monde par le truchement d\u2019un moniteur f\u0153tal. Il nous guide via la puce GPS de notre t\u00e9l\u00e9phone. Par l\u2019ESP, il assure notre protection lorsqu\u2019il ajuste la trajectoire de notre v\u00e9hicule ou il d\u00e9clenche nos airbags. Tout est (ou devient) num\u00e9rique : nos paiements, notre \u00e9clairage, notre cuisine et m\u00eame nos villes. Ces derni\u00e8res brassent des millions de donn\u00e9es estimant la qualit\u00e9 de l\u2019air, l\u2019\u00e9tat du trafic ou pr\u00e9venant les inondations. M\u00eame les pigeons peuvent \u00eatre mis \u00e0 contribution pour analyser la qualit\u00e9 de l\u2019air et donner l\u2019information aux citadins sur Twitter. Les imprimantes 3D ont permis des choses compl\u00e8tement ahurissantes. On a vu des proth\u00e8ses con\u00e7ues en 3D redonnant une main \u00e0 un enfant de moins de 10 ans. On peut m\u00eame imprimer des maisons ou de la peau en 3D. Et l\u2019on pourrait multiplier \u00e0 l\u2019envi les exemples. Le vocabulaire t\u00e9moigne \u00e9galement de cette omnipr\u00e9sence. On l\u2019a dit, on trouve le mot \u00ab num\u00e9rique \u00bb dans la loi pour la refondation de l\u2019\u00c9cole. Il fut autrefois signe inqui\u00e9tant de fracture. Il est aujourd\u2019hui l\u2019objet de r\u00e9flexions tr\u00e8s avanc\u00e9es de la part d\u2019intellectuels comme Michel Serres ou Bernard Stiegler. On r\u00e9clamait m\u00eame qu\u2019il soit, apr\u00e8s l\u2019autisme ou l\u2019illettrisme, d\u00e9clar\u00e9 Grande cause nationale. Ce \u00ab num\u00e9rique \u00bb n\u2019est donc pas qu\u2019un mot. C\u2019est une r\u00e9alit\u00e9 tr\u00e8s concr\u00e8te. Mais, \u00e0 y bien r\u00e9fl\u00e9chir, on ne sait pas trop ce qu\u2019est le \u00ab num\u00e9rique \u00bb pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment. On le sait partout. On peut comprendre ce qu\u2019est une ampoule connect\u00e9e ou un paiement \u00e9lectronique, mais on a un peu plus de mal \u00e0 expliquer ce qu\u2019on entend par \u00ab le num\u00e9rique \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9cole \u00bb. Je vous ferai gr\u00e2ce d\u2019une d\u00e9finition puis\u00e9e dans le dictionnaire. Cependant, revenons \u00e0 l\u2019ann\u00e9e 1985, l\u2019ann\u00e9e du Plan Informatique pour tous. L\u2019informatique, tout le monde sait ce que c\u2019est : des machines, des 0 et des 1, des langages, des logiciels, le traitement de l\u2019information, etc. Le num\u00e9rique, c\u2019est plus compliqu\u00e9. Bien s\u00fbr, dans la d\u00e9finition que je ne vous ai pas donn\u00e9e, on trouverait aussi les 0 et les 1, mais est-ce tout ? De 1985 \u00e0 2013 (date de la loi de la refondation de l\u2019\u00e9cole), on aurait juste assist\u00e9 \u00e0 une substitution lexicale ? Non bien s\u00fbr. En fait, j\u2019ose croire que le passage de l\u2019informatique au num\u00e9rique a un sens, selon la double acception du terme : une direction et une signification. En effet, depuis 1985, on a envie de croire que les choses ont chang\u00e9 et que l\u2019on sait o\u00f9 l\u2019on va, que l\u2019on ne r\u00e9p\u00e9tera pas les m\u00eames erreurs. On admet qu\u2019il ne suffit pas d\u2019\u00e9quiper en ordinateurs des \u00e9tablissements, que sans formation des professeurs, le seul \u00e9quipement informatique ne changera pas l\u2019enseignement. Il ne saurait uniquement s\u2019agir d\u2019enseigner le Basic, le Logo ou quelque langage de programmation que ce soit. Aussi avons-nous d\u00e9laiss\u00e9 le mot \u00ab informatique \u00bb au profit de \u00ab num\u00e9rique \u00bb, charg\u00e9 \u00e0 lui seul de toutes les promesses d\u2019une \u00e9cole plus appropri\u00e9e aux d\u00e9fis actuels, plus juste, plus efficace. Mais de quelle fa\u00e7on l\u2019injonction du passage au num\u00e9rique remplira-t-elle cet objectif ? Cela n\u2019a rien d\u2019\u00e9vident. Voyons ce que c\u2019est que le num\u00e9rique en 2016. Emmanuel Davidenkoff commence son livre ainsi : \u00ab Un tsunami s\u2019appr\u00eate \u00e0 d\u00e9ferler sur nos \u00e9coles, nos universit\u00e9s, nos grandes \u00e9coles \u00bb. Je ne voudrais pas faire un mauvais proc\u00e8s \u00e0 l\u2019auteur de cet excellent livre, mais enfin il faut avouer que sous nos contr\u00e9es le tsunami num\u00e9rique avance \u00e0 la vitesse d\u2019un modem 56 k. La plupart des salles n\u2019ont pas grand-chose de num\u00e9rique. Heureusement, nous sommes \u00e0 un tournant et le pr\u00e9sident Fran\u00e7ois Hollande a annonc\u00e9 que tous les coll\u00e9giens de 5e seraient \u00e9quip\u00e9s d\u2019une tablette\u2026 en 2016. On sait donc d\u00e9sormais que \u00e7a ne sera pas le cas. En fait, seulement 25% des coll\u00e8ges seront \u00e9quip\u00e9s. Il faudra encore beaucoup d\u2019acharnement de la part des collectivit\u00e9s locales ou des enseignants, f\u00e9rus de num\u00e9rique et qui d\u00e9veloppent des tr\u00e9sors d\u2019inventivit\u00e9 pour faire entrer le num\u00e9rique dans leur pratique. Ils donnent \u00e9galement beaucoup de leur personne. Ils donnent aussi beaucoup de leur porte-monnaie. Si l\u2019on proc\u00e8de \u00e0 un \u00e9tat des lieux des pratiques et si l\u2019on excepte ces quelques enseignants qui litt\u00e9ralement luttent parfois contre leur hi\u00e9rarchie ou certains parents et qui sont des exceptions, on verra qu\u2019on est toujours\u2026 en 1350. Un bureau, des rang\u00e9es de tables, des chaises. Parfois on a mass\u00e9 des \u00e9l\u00e8ves (et on est quand m\u00eame somm\u00e9 de faire entrer le num\u00e9rique), parfois on trouve un peu de num\u00e9rique. Voyons donc \u00e0 pr\u00e9sent quelles sont les pratiques les plus fr\u00e9quentes, celles-l\u00e0 m\u00eames qui sont entr\u00e9es dans les habitudes. Le num\u00e9rique en classe est surtout \u00e0 chercher du c\u00f4t\u00e9 des professeurs qui l'utilisent depuis belle lurette. Ceux-ci produisent leurs cours avec, parfois les projettent en classe. Ils ont souvent pris le soin de t\u00e9l\u00e9charger telle vid\u00e9o sur YouTube afin de n'\u00eatre pas d\u00e9pendants des lenteurs d'un r\u00e9seau faiblard et sursollicit\u00e9. Mais c'est \u00e0 peu pr\u00e8s tout. L'ordinateur de l'enseignant \u00e0 la maison ou branch\u00e9 en classe sur le vid\u00e9oprojecteur, mais rien pour les \u00e9l\u00e8ves (du moins si l'on excepte les acad\u00e9mies pionni\u00e8res ou les coll\u00e8ges connect\u00e9s qui, on l\u2019a vu, sont loin de repr\u00e9senter la totalit\u00e9 des \u00e9tablissements du territoire). Cet ordinateur professoral sert aussi \u00e0 faire l'appel, rentrer les notes ou remplir le cahier des textes, mais on voit l\u00e0 qu'on n'est pas particuli\u00e8rement dans l'innovation. Et encore celle-ci n'est-elle pas forc\u00e9ment rendue possible par les politiques d'\u00e9quipement des \u00e9tablissements. J\u2019allais \u00e9crire que la plupart des salles \u00e9taient aujourd\u2019hui \u00e9quip\u00e9es d\u2019un vid\u00e9oprojecteur et j\u2019ai demand\u00e9 sur Twitter ce qu\u2019il en \u00e9tait. Ce n\u2019est malheureusement pas le cas dans le primaire. Et il y a, dans le secondaire, de fortes disparit\u00e9s. En 2015, on compte en moyenne 31 vid\u00e9oprojecteurs et 11 tableaux interactifs pour 1 000 coll\u00e9giens. L'utilisation de vid\u00e9oprojecteurs interactifs dans le primaire s'\u00e9l\u00e8ve \u00e0 6,5 pour 1000 \u00e9coliers et \u00e0 14,3 pour les \u00e9coles ayant b\u00e9n\u00e9fici\u00e9 du plan ENR (Ecole Num\u00e9rique Rurale). Et l\u2019on voit avec ce document que l\u2019\u00e9quipement informatique a doubl\u00e9 en 10 ans. Cela laisse r\u00eaveur. Pour rappel, Ray Tomlinson, le papa de l\u2019email, est mort le 6 mars 2016. Son invention, le SNDMSG, qui permettait d'envoyer un message sur le r\u00e9seau Arpanet date de\u2026 1971 (et le \u00ab Readmail \u00bb, qui permettait de r\u00e9cup\u00e9rer et de lire ces messages). Autre exemple : la premi\u00e8re utilisation du terme \u00ab PDA \u00bb (\u00ab Personal Digital Assistant \u00bb), cet anc\u00eatre de la tablette, remonte \u00e0 1992. Combien l\u2019adoption de technologies si peu r\u00e9centes est lente ! Mais revenons \u00e0 nos vid\u00e9oprojecteurs. Il est parfois difficile de remplacer un appareil d\u00e9fectueux et le remplacement d\u2019une lampe peut prendre des mois en fonction du budget. Quoi qu\u2019il en soit, l\u2019introduction d\u2019un tel appareil s\u2019est faite lentement mais s\u00fbrement. Elle s\u2019est faite d\u2019autant plus facilement que la chose venait succ\u00e9der au r\u00e9troprojecteur. Il y avait donc une filiation et l\u2019usage du vid\u00e9oprojecteur n\u2019avait rien d\u2019intrusif, de \u00ab disruptif \u00bb comme se plaisent \u00e0 le dire des utilisateurs anglophiles. Parfois certaines salles sont \u00e9quip\u00e9es de TBI (Tableaux Blancs Interactifs) qui peuvent avoir quelques usages int\u00e9ressants mais n\u2019offrent rien de transcendants. Pour ma part, je m\u2019en sers quand je morcelle les activit\u00e9s en classe. Ainsi certains \u00e9l\u00e8ves finissent leurs r\u00e9dactions car ils ont eu besoin d\u2019un peu plus de temps, quelques-uns enregistrent leur audiobook et d\u2019autres, enfin, font des exercices interactifs au tableau. C\u2019est pratique, mais ce n\u2019est pas la r\u00e9volution num\u00e9rique. Faire des exercices \u00e0 trous au tableau ne justifie pas qu\u2019on investisse dans un tableau de 1000 \u00e0 1500 \u20ac. Ces tableaux ont connu un fort succ\u00e8s il y a quelques ann\u00e9es en apportant un peu d\u2019interaction, mais \u00e0 l\u2019usage on s\u2019est vite rendu compte que l\u2019engouement pour une telle technologie avait une limite p\u00e9dagogique. En effet, l\u2019int\u00e9gration des nouvelles technologies s\u2019apparentait \u00e0 une reproduction de p\u00e9dagogies anciennes. En d\u2019autres termes, le num\u00e9rique n\u2019apportait rien ou pas grand-chose. On rempla\u00e7ait l\u00e0 la feuille et le stylo par le traitement de texte, ici le livre papier par un ebook. Il n\u2019est pas rare de constater que l\u2019\u00e9quipement num\u00e9rique ne remplace rien du tout. Je me souviens d\u2019un m\u00e9decin qui me parlait de ses enfants, lesquels venaient d\u2019obtenir du Conseil g\u00e9n\u00e9ral un ordinateur. On \u00e9tait au tout d\u00e9but du plan d\u2019\u00e9quipement initi\u00e9 par le conseil des Landes. C\u2019\u00e9tait donc en 2001. Les ordinateurs \u00e9taient lourds. Or les enfants de ce m\u00e9decin \u00e9taient somm\u00e9s d\u2019apporter leur ordinateur et\u2026 les manuels scolaires\u2026 et les cahiers. On est l\u00e0 dans une \u00e9tape de coexistence de l\u2019ancien et du nouveau. Il y a pourtant une r\u00e9flexion \u00e0 mener : comment la technologie va-t-elle modifier l\u2019enseignement ? Le mod\u00e8le SAMR a \u00e9t\u00e9 cr\u00e9\u00e9 par Ruben Puentedura, un chercheur am\u00e9ricain. L\u2019acronyme SAMR signifie Substitution, Augmentation, Modification et Red\u00e9finition. Chaque mot d\u00e9finit un grade dans l\u2019\u00e9chelle d\u2019adoption du num\u00e9rique. La premi\u00e8re est donc la substitution : la technologie remplace les outils sans apporter d\u2019am\u00e9lioration. C\u2019est donc le plus bas niveau d\u2019int\u00e9gration. L\u2019enseignant peut alors se demander quel est l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat du num\u00e9rique. \u00c9crire pour \u00e9crire, \u00e0 quoi bon utiliser un clavier \u00e0 la place d\u2019un stylo ? La deuxi\u00e8me \u00e9tape est l\u2019augmentation. La technologie remplace les outils habituels mais en apportant cette fois une am\u00e9lioration. Le traitement de texte pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment cit\u00e9 peut permettre un \u00e9ventuel recours au correcteur orthographique. La troisi\u00e8me \u00e9tape du sch\u00e9ma est la modification. Cette fois, la technologie permet une red\u00e9finition significative des t\u00e2ches. Par exemple, un texte mis en ligne peut \u00eatre enrichi des commentaires d\u2019\u00e9ventuels visiteurs. Le traitement du texte peut d\u2019ailleurs \u00eatre r\u00e9alis\u00e9 sur une application en ligne et le travail devient collaboratif. On recourt alors \u00e0 l\u2019intelligence collective pour mettre \u00e0 bien des projets complexes, riches et qui n\u00e9cessitent diverses interventions. Enfin, la red\u00e9finition est la derni\u00e8re \u00e9tape. La technologie permet de r\u00e9aliser de nouvelles t\u00e2ches auparavant inconcevables. Par exemple, le texte con\u00e7u pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment peut \u00eatre le pr\u00e9lude \u00e0 la r\u00e9alisation sinon d\u2019un documentaire vid\u00e9o, du moins peut-il \u00eatre enrichi de vid\u00e9os, de sons, d\u2019images. Les journaux t\u00e9l\u00e9vis\u00e9s ou les webradios sont un bon exemple de ce que le num\u00e9rique permet aujourd\u2019hui de faire et que l\u2019on ne pouvait r\u00e9aliser auparavant. On pouvait certes organiser de petits sketchs autour d\u2019une table o\u00f9 chaque \u00e9l\u00e8ve pouvait jouer au journaliste mais le travail ne recevrait aucun \u00e9cho de l\u2019ext\u00e9rieur. Aucun parent ne pouvait voir ce qu\u2019avaient fait les \u00e9l\u00e8ves, aucun journaliste ne pouvait intervenir durant le d\u00e9bat \u00e0 l\u2019impromptu, cr\u00e9ant la surprise, et faisant b\u00e9n\u00e9ficier la classe de conseils inattendus. Aucun visiteur du bout du monde ne pouvait ainsi r\u00e9v\u00e9ler \u00e0 la classe \u00e9bahie l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat que l\u2019on peut prendre \u00e0 un travail scolaire dont le seul professeur \u00e9tait en principe le destinataire. Aucun \u00e9l\u00e8ve ne pouvait ressentir ce petit frisson si n\u00e9cessaire de la publication. Produire et avoir une audience, voil\u00e0 \u00e0 coup s\u00fbr, un int\u00e9r\u00eat suppl\u00e9mentaire de bien faire. Si l\u2019apport du num\u00e9rique est faible ou si le num\u00e9rique est une simple reproduction de ce qu\u2019on pouvait faire sans, alors il m\u00e9rite qu\u2019on le consid\u00e8re comme un vulgaire gadget. Or on ne peut nier la propension que l\u2019on a \u00e0 reproduire avec du nouveau ce que l\u2019on faisait auparavant. C\u2019est absolument normal. On a tous vu au moins une fois cette caricature repr\u00e9sentant deux femmes de m\u00e9nage, l\u2019une \u00e9poussetant les tapis avec une tapette et l\u2019autre\u2026 avec son aspirateur. Cette derni\u00e8re ne comprenant pas bien quel peut \u00eatre l\u2019apport de la modernit\u00e9, l\u2019objet \u00e9tant si lourd, si peu pratique et si peu efficace ! Ce dessin nous montre cette propension que nous avons \u00e0 reproduire des habitudes avec de nouveaux \u00ab outils \u00bb. Pourvu qu\u2019on ne prenne pas les enseignants \u00e0 rebrousse-poil en leur disant qu\u2019il faut absolument qu\u2019ils changent leurs pratiques abusivement qualifi\u00e9es de d\u00e9pass\u00e9es et de r\u00e9trogrades, on pourra avantageusement leur pr\u00e9senter le mod\u00e8le SAMR et leur faire miroiter tout l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat de la Red\u00e9finition. On pourra se demander : qu\u2019est-ce que le num\u00e9rique apporte de si indispensable ? \u00c0 cette question, de nombreux enseignants ont r\u00e9pondu en d\u00e9veloppant des ressources nombreuses, vari\u00e9es et ils les diffusent all\u00e8grement sur les r\u00e9seaux sociaux mais ces enseignants hyper connect\u00e9s ne sont pas la majorit\u00e9 du corps et avant de voir ce qu'ils font, demandons-nous \u00e0 nouveau ce que le num\u00e9rique a de si n\u00e9cessaire qu'il faille l'int\u00e9grer en classe.","title":"Le num\u00e9rique en 2016"},{"location":"%C3%89criture/Un%20Centaure%20%C3%A0%20l%27%C3%A9cole/Les%20centaures/","text":"Le d\u00e9but du livre de Clive Thompson, Smarter than you think , nous raconte une histoire extraordinaire. Celle-ci commence avec le champion d\u2019\u00e9checs Garry Kasparov et sa d\u00e9faite contre Deep Blue, un ordinateur con\u00e7u par IBM, en 1996. Cette d\u00e9faite consacrait-elle le succ\u00e8s de l\u2019intelligence artificielle ? Fallait-il abdiquer toute pr\u00e9tention \u00e0 jouer \u00e0 un jeu auquel les machines excellaient ? Des machines capables de calculer 200 millions de coups par seconde ? Garry Kasparov eut une id\u00e9e. Il se dit que plut\u00f4t de lutter contre la machine, il fallait jouer avec la machine. L\u2019homme et l\u2019ordinateur devaient collaborer. L\u2019un et l\u2019autre b\u00e9n\u00e9ficieraient de leurs qualit\u00e9s respectives. L\u2019ordinateur apporterait sa puissance de calcul et donc sa capacit\u00e9 \u00e0 traiter en un instant des millions de possibilit\u00e9s, ses bases de donn\u00e9es contenant l\u2019historique et le d\u00e9tail de milliers de parties, tandis que l\u2019homme apporterait sa cr\u00e9ativit\u00e9, sa capacit\u00e9 \u00e0 percer l\u2019adversaire et \u00e0 le d\u00e9stabiliser en jouant un coup inattendu par son intuition et sa perspicacit\u00e9. C\u2019est ce qu\u2019on a baptis\u00e9 Advanced Chess, une technique de jeu qui permettrait d\u2019\u00e9viter de perdre \u00e0 cause d\u2019une erreur de calcul. Ainsi allaient s\u2019affronter deux \u00e9quipes : un homme et un ordinateur contre un autre homme \u00e9quip\u00e9 lui aussi d\u2019un ordinateur. \u00c0 ce jeu, Kasparov affronta un autre grand joueur, Veselin Topalov. Ce dernier \u00e9tait moins fort que son adversaire, mais il gagna, ayant mieux exploit\u00e9 les ressources offertes par l\u2019ordinateur. Cette technique de jeu assist\u00e9 par ordinateur a donn\u00e9 naissance au Freestyle Chess, une variante de l\u2019Advanced Chess. Le joueur, appel\u00e9 Centaure, peut \u00eatre assist\u00e9 d\u2019autres joueurs ainsi que de divers programmes d\u2019\u00e9checs. Le centaure est ici un \u00eatre hybride qui parie sur l\u2019int\u00e9gration de l\u2019homme et de la machine. La v\u00e9ritable force du centaure est d\u2019\u00eatre capable de combiner les capacit\u00e9s strat\u00e9giques purement humaines \u00e0 la puissance de calcul de l\u2019ordinateur (la \u00ab brute force \u00bb). En 2005, un fait int\u00e9ressant durant ces parties de Freestyle est \u00e0 prendre en consid\u00e9ration : des amateurs ont \u00e9t\u00e9 confront\u00e9s \u00e0 des professionnels, et ces amateurs ont r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 battre des joueurs professionnels parce qu\u2019ils \u00e9taient plus prompts \u00e0 collaborer, \u00e0 travailler ensemble par \u00e9quipe tout en s\u2019aidant d\u2019ordinateurs. Ils collaboraient avec les machines, sachant quand se fier \u00e0 leurs conseils et quand privil\u00e9gier des combinaisons jug\u00e9es peu fiables par la machine mais susceptibles de d\u00e9contenancer l\u2019adversaire. Mieux encore, ce sont des amateurs qui ont battu Hydra, un ordinateur beaucoup plus puissant que Deep Blue (un cluster de plusieurs machines disposant de 16 processeurs Intel Xeon cadenc\u00e9 \u00e0 3,06 GHz et poss\u00e9dant 32 Go de m\u00e9moire vive). Clive Thompson en arrive \u00e0 cette question : qui est le plus intelligent ? L\u2019\u00eatre humain ? La machine ? En fait, il ne sert \u00e0 rien de les opposer. Ils travaillent ensemble. Cette id\u00e9e du mariage entre l'intelligence humaine et l\u2019intelligence artificielle, on la retrouve d\u00e9velopp\u00e9e par Emmanuel Davidenkoff. Selon le journaliste, l'intelligence artificielle va changer la fa\u00e7on d'exercer de nombreux m\u00e9tiers auxquels on acc\u00e8de aujourd'hui avec un bac + 5 voire davantage. Dans certains m\u00e9tiers, 80% de ce que font des hommes peut \u00eatre r\u00e9alis\u00e9 par une machine pour un co\u00fbt moindre. Dans ces 80 %, il y a le par c\u0153ur, l'empilement de connaissances, l\u2019automatisation, toutes sortes de comp\u00e9tences pour lesquelles l'ordinateur bat l'homme \u00e0 plate couture. Les 20% restant vont prendre une nouvelle importance. Ce sont les qualit\u00e9s humaines que la machine est incapable de dupliquer comme l\u2019empathie ou la capacit\u00e9 \u00e0 prendre un risque. Dans le contexte des langues vivantes, l\u2019individu peut se pr\u00e9valoir de la compr\u00e9hension d'une culture, d'une nuance qui \u00e9chappera \u00e0 la machine. Par quelque bout que l\u2019on prenne les choses, l\u2019\u00eatre humain et la machine doivent collaborer. Il faut se faire \u00e0 l'id\u00e9e qu'une intelligence artificielle puisse devenir l'une de vos coll\u00e8gues, comme dans ce cabinet d'avocats. Cela semble d\u00e9sormais un processus in\u00e9vitable que ce remplacement de certains m\u00e9tiers par la machine. Qui se souvient qu'il y a encore quelques ann\u00e9es, il fallait une main d'\u0153uvre nombreuse pour faucher le bl\u00e9 \u00e0 la main (ou du moins \u00e0 l'aide une faux) ? Qu'un individu venait \u00e0 vous, vous demandait ce que vous vouliez et vous servait l'essence dans le r\u00e9servoir de votre voiture ? Qu'une op\u00e9ratrice, au t\u00e9l\u00e9phone (les \u00ab demoiselles du t\u00e9l\u00e9phone \u00bb), vous mettait en communication avec la personne demand\u00e9e \u00e0 une \u00e9poque o\u00f9 le r\u00e9seau t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique n'\u00e9tait pas automatis\u00e9 ? Combien de temps y aura-t-il encore des gens \u00e0 une caisse dans un supermarch\u00e9 pour scanner vos articles ? Jusqu'\u00e0 quel point les voitures autonomes remplaceront-elles les conducteurs de taxis ou de VTC ? Allez-vous \u00e0 la banque pour retirer de l'argent ou privil\u00e9giez-vous la caisse automatique ? Qui se souvient de ce qu'est un portefaix ? Cette liste peut m\u00eame avoir quelque chose d'assez angoissant si l'on se contente de regarder notre activit\u00e9 d\u00e9cro\u00eetre. Et cela ne risque pas de s'arranger. Selon une r\u00e9cente recherche, 45% des activit\u00e9s pour lesquelles les gens sont pay\u00e9s pourrait \u00eatre r\u00e9alis\u00e9 par des machines, y compris des m\u00e9tiers qui requi\u00e8rent des qualifications importantes. Le premier robot pharmacien devrait arriver vers 2021. Cela signifie quand m\u00eame qu'une part non n\u00e9gligeable de l'activit\u00e9 pour laquelle nous sommes r\u00e9mun\u00e9r\u00e9s pourrait \u00eatre d\u00e9barrass\u00e9e de t\u00e2ches ingrates et qui seront probablement mieux r\u00e9alis\u00e9es par un robot. Remarquez que cela ne signifie pas que certains lieux seront enti\u00e8rement robotis\u00e9s. La pr\u00e9sence humaine, pour des raisons assez \u00e9videntes, est encore n\u00e9cessaire. On pr\u00e9f\u00e9rera toujours au r\u00e9veil d'une lourde op\u00e9ration avoir affaire \u00e0 un \u00eatre humain qu'\u00e0 une machine. D'ailleurs, en mati\u00e8re de sant\u00e9, le m\u00e9tier d'infirmi\u00e8re n\u00e9cessiterait une expertise et un contact direct avec le patient qu'aucune machine ne saurait remplacer. Seuls 30% de l'activit\u00e9 d'une infirmi\u00e8re pourrait \u00eatre automatis\u00e9. Pour un dentiste, cette proportion tombe \u00e0 13%. Cependant, une partie de notre travail ou de notre environnement sera automatis\u00e9. Par exemple, pour rester dans le domaine de la sant\u00e9, administrer un anesth\u00e9siant ou lire une radio ou une image provenant d'un scanner peuvent \u00eatre automatis\u00e9s (op. cit.). Peut-\u00eatre que les enseignants (lesquels n'ont rien \u00e0 craindre de cette \u00ab invasion \u00bb des machines), en privil\u00e9giant certaines activit\u00e9s dont il sera question plus loin dans ce livre, recourent d\u00e9j\u00e0 aux machines pour r\u00e9aliser un certain type de travail. Pour ma part, je pense aux dict\u00e9es que l'ordinateur r\u00e9p\u00e8te \u00e0 l'envi selon un rythme choisi par l'\u00e9l\u00e8ve et pour lesquelles l'ordinateur est susceptible de faire quelques suggestions de corrections orthographiques avant que je ne vienne regarder ce qu'a fait l'\u00e9l\u00e8ve, le conseiller, le rassurer ou l'aider. Mais il ne s'agit pas seulement de laisser faire la machine ou d'automatiser autant de t\u00e2ches que faire se peut. Il s'agit d'apprendre \u00e0 travailler avec la machine. J\u2019ai toujours regrett\u00e9 que des \u00e9l\u00e8ves aient des t\u00e9l\u00e9phones dont la puissance est rel\u00e9gu\u00e9e au fond de la poche. Et surtout, on voit encore une fois que loin d\u2019isoler l\u2019individu dans des pratiques asociales de geeks renferm\u00e9s, travailler avec un ordinateur suppose la collaboration avec ces ordinateurs mais aussi, comme dans le Freestyle Chess, avec d\u2019autres utilisateurs. Le travail collaboratif est d\u2019ailleurs l\u2019illustration m\u00eame de ce qu\u2019est aujourd\u2019hui internet, de Wikip\u00e9dia aux r\u00e9seaux sociaux. Je suis m\u00eame de plus en plus convaincu que toute activit\u00e9 scolaire doit impliquer cette dimension sociale qui enrichit consid\u00e9rablement (et pour des raisons que nous d\u00e9velopperons ult\u00e9rieurement) les activit\u00e9s r\u00e9alis\u00e9es en classe. Le num\u00e9rique, en \u00e9tant social, favorise la collaboration et accro\u00eet les exigences que les enseignants sont en mesure d'attendre de leurs \u00e9l\u00e8ves. Mais, pour en revenir \u00e0 notre propos, cette id\u00e9e de collaboration est extr\u00eamement importante. On la retrouve tout r\u00e9cemment dans les propos tenus par Demis Hassabis, le fondateur du logiciel d'AlphaGo tournant sur DeepMind, l'ordinateur qui a battu Lee Sedol, le champion du monde du jeu de Go, jeu qui \u00e9tait r\u00e9put\u00e9 pour \u00eatre le dernier bastion de l'intelligence humaine. AlphaGo ne s'est pas simplement livr\u00e9 \u00e0 des calculs en force brute afin de d\u00e9terminer des milliers de coups d\u2019avance, comme ce fut le cas avec Deep Blue d\u2019IBM face \u00e0 Kasparov, mais a pris la place d\u2019un joueur. AlphaGo ne r\u00e9p\u00e8te pas des combinaisons, il apprend. Les commentateurs \u2014 et Sedol lui-m\u00eame \u2014 ont \u00e9t\u00e9 surpris par l\u2019attitude de l\u2019intelligence artificielle qui a fait preuve d\u2019ing\u00e9niosit\u00e9 et d\u2019originalit\u00e9. Mais ce qui est \u00e9tonnant, c'est que Sedol ait \u00e9t\u00e9 capable de rivaliser contre un ordinateur capable de calculer des dizaines de milliers de positions par seconde et m\u00eame repousser AlphaGo dans ses retranchements. Certes, sur les cinq manches que comptait le tournoi, AlphaGo en a remport\u00e9 4. Le champion a tenu 5 heures lors de la troisi\u00e8me manche et tenu en \u00e9chec la machine. Ce qui signifie que le joueur a observ\u00e9 le comportement de la machine et a \u00e9t\u00e9 capable de s'adapter autant que faire se pouvait. Et si l'on se demande \u00e0 quoi cette intelligence artificielle peut bien servir sinon d\u00e9primer des champions du monde, le fondateur d'AlphaGo nous donne la r\u00e9ponse : \u00ab What I\u2019m really excited to use this kind of AI for is science, and advancing that faster. I\u2019d like to see AI-assisted science where you have effectively AI research assistants that do a lot of the drudgery work and surface interesting articles, find structure in vast amounts of data, and then surface that to the human experts and scientists who can make quicker breakthroughs. I was giving a talk at CERN a few months ago ; obviously they create more data than pretty much anyone on the planet, and for all we know there could be new particles sitting on their massive hard drives somewhere and no-one\u2019s got around to analyzing that because there\u2019s just so much data. So I think it\u2019d be cool if one day an AI was involved in finding a new particle. \u00bb Ainsi, \u00e0 l'heure du big data, l'intelligence artificielle va aider l'homme \u00e0 trier et analyser des quantit\u00e9s indicibles de donn\u00e9es. Nous cr\u00e9ons environ 2,5 trillions d\u2019octets de donn\u00e9es tous les jours et il est impensable que la seule activit\u00e9 humaine puisse proc\u00e9der \u00e0 un stockage, un tri, une analyse de ces donn\u00e9es. En devenant num\u00e9rique, notre activit\u00e9 est enregistr\u00e9e et analys\u00e9e en permanence : emails, likes sur les r\u00e9seaux sociaux, clics divers sur internet, activit\u00e9 de lecture, d\u00e9placements, podom\u00e8tre, sommeil, consommation... Tout est mesur\u00e9 et calcul\u00e9. Comme l'indique Dominique Cardon, on pourrait maudire la machine si l'on ne se rappelait que \u00ab les technologies trament notre monde depuis si longtemps qu\u2019il est erron\u00e9 de s\u00e9parer les humains de leur environnement sociotechnique \u00bb. Et il ajoute un peu plus loin, \u00e9voquant l'influence des calculateurs et des algorithmes sur notre comportement : \u00ab Plut\u00f4t que de dramatiser le conflit entre les humains et les machines, il est plus judicieux de les consid\u00e9rer comme un couple qui ne cesse de r\u00e9troagir et de s'influencer mutuellement \u00bb. Selon Dominique Cardon toujours, l'individu peut briser le d\u00e9terminisme math\u00e9matique qui cherche \u00e0 orienter nos comportements par le biais des algorithmes. Il peut mettre \u00e0 mal l'assujettissement de l'internaute vers telle information, telle vid\u00e9o ou tel parcours, encore qu'il lui faille comprendre \u00e0 quoi r\u00eavent les algorithmes. Mais c'est un autre sujet. Il s'agit donc de collaboration et pas uniquement d'affrontement entre l'homme et la machine. Tous deux doivent collaborer. Et je crois qu'il est vraiment important que les \u00e9l\u00e8ves apprennent \u00e0 travailler avec des machines et \u00e0 retrouver et trier et utiliser des masses de donn\u00e9es. Ce qui s\u2019est pass\u00e9 avec les Panama Papers est un exemple suppl\u00e9mentaire du travail collaboratif qui sera de fa\u00e7on irr\u00e9fragable le lot de nos \u00e9l\u00e8ves devenus adultes. Les Panama Papers sont la fuite de donn\u00e9es la plus importante de l\u2019histoire du journalisme qui repr\u00e9sente 11,5 millions de documents, soit 2,6 t\u00e9raoctets (2600 Go) de donn\u00e9es secr\u00e8tes d\u00e9couvertes, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire 1500 fois Wikileaks. Comment traite-t-on autant de donn\u00e9es ? Assur\u00e9ment pas seul. 376 journalistes ont travaill\u00e9 ensemble sous la houlette du ICIJ (Consortium international des journalistes d\u2019investigation). Mais des centaines de journalistes ne suffisent pas. Il leur faut des ordinateurs et notamment un moteur de recherche con\u00e7u sp\u00e9cifiquement pour explorer les bases de donn\u00e9es des journalistes. Encore fallait-il savoir s\u2019en servir et \u00eatre capable de proc\u00e9der \u00e0 des recherches avanc\u00e9es. Il fallait aussi savoir utiliser un OCR afin de parcourir des documents non encore num\u00e9ris\u00e9s. Ce ne sont que quelques exemples des outils n\u00e9cessaires \u00e0 la r\u00e9alisation du travail journalistique. Ce n\u2019est \u00e9videmment pas tout et l\u2019on voit que les journalistes ont d\u00fb apprendre \u00e0 travailler avec la machine pour trier ce \u00ab big data \u00bb mais aussi avec leurs confr\u00e8res, communiquer avec pr\u00e8s de 400 d\u2019entre eux sur un forum s\u00e9curis\u00e9. Mais il y a une autre raison pour laquelle j\u2019aime l\u2019image du centaure. C\u2019est qu\u2019elle nous renvoie \u00e0 l\u2019animal. Manifestement, ces cr\u00e9atures n\u2019ont pas bonne presse et c\u2019est le cas de toutes ces cr\u00e9atures hybrides que sont les faunes ou les satyres ou encore le Sphinx. Songez \u00e9galement au minotaure. Cela dit, et parmi les centaures m\u00eames, il y a des exceptions notables comme Chiron, pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment r\u00e9put\u00e9 pour sa sagesse et l\u2019\u00e9tendue de ses connaissances. Mais le centaure Chiron, c\u2019est aussi\u2026 un enseignant ou disons un pr\u00e9cepteur, celui d\u2019Achille par exemple, \u00e0 qui il a dispens\u00e9 une \u00e9ducation intellectuelle et physique. C\u2019est notamment la vivacit\u00e9 physique qui me s\u00e9duit dans cette m\u00e9taphore du centaure, et donc du caract\u00e8re hybride de l\u2019individu et du num\u00e9rique. En effet, on a pu penser que le num\u00e9rique nous transformerait en individus avachis sur un fauteuil de bureau ou sur le canap\u00e9, mais pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment, c\u2019est le contraire qui se passe. Votre smartphone ou votre montre vous rappelle qu\u2019il est temps de vous lever, de vous bouger, de faire vos 10000 pas par jour ou de faire votre jogging. On me demandait il y a quelque temps si le fait d\u2019aller courir dans la for\u00eat ne serait pas l\u2019occasion id\u00e9ale de se d\u00e9connecter. Je trouvais la question plut\u00f4t pertinente, mais je me disais alors que mon smartphone m\u2019est d\u2019une utilit\u00e9 \u00e0 laquelle je ne saurais me soustraire. Passons le fait qu\u2019il enregistre des donn\u00e9es qu\u2019il m\u2019est int\u00e9ressant de consulter ne serait-ce que pour me fixer des objectifs \u00e0 d\u00e9passer. Surtout, la machine m\u2019invite \u00e0 faire mieux (pas dans un futur hypoth\u00e9tique, mais d\u00e8s maintenant, au moment o\u00f9 je cours). La musique (parfois choisie en fonction de mes go\u00fbts, parfois choisie par un algorithme en fonction de mon rythme) est une invitation \u00e0 poursuivre, elle est en elle-m\u00eame un entra\u00eenement. Mais ce que je pr\u00e9f\u00e8re par-dessus tout, c\u2019est l\u2019\u00e9coute de podcasts \u2014 ces \u00e9missions de radio (le plus souvent) que j\u2019ai sauvegard\u00e9es sur mon t\u00e9l\u00e9phone \u2014 et qui pendant que je fatigue le corps, s\u2019adressent \u00e0 l\u2019esprit. C\u2019est d\u2019ailleurs un excellent moyen de se concentrer sur ce qui se dit (surtout si l\u2019on \u00e9coute France Culture) et d\u2019oublier momentan\u00e9ment la fatigue. \u00c9videmment, tout le monde comprendra que l\u2019on renouvelle la formule \u00ab anima sana in corpore sana \u00bb. Je reprends la citation en ces termes (et non \u00ab mens sana\u2026 \u00bb) eu \u00e9gard \u00e0 mes chaussures (ASICS = anima sana in corpore sana). Il m\u2019arrive souvent, en courant, de convoquer Siri et de lui demander de prendre en note les pens\u00e9es qui me viennent \u00e0 l\u2019esprit. L\u2019activit\u00e9 sportive si elle est l\u2019occasion de se reposer l\u2019esprit est aussi r\u00e9g\u00e9n\u00e9ratrice, roborative et au moment o\u00f9 vous voudriez \u00e9vacuer tout le reste, c\u2019est \u00e0 ce moment pr\u00e9cis que ce reste a la dr\u00f4le d'id\u00e9e de surgir. N\u2019avez-vous jamais pest\u00e9 contre cette r\u00e9flexion brillante qui vous venait au moment le plus inattendu et que vous auriez voulu \u00e0 tout prix inscrire, mais que pour une raison ou une autre vous ne pouviez pas ? Maintenant, vous pouvez tout noter, tout le temps, partout. Le jeu peut aussi \u00eatre le moyen d\u2019am\u00e9liorer ses performances. Par exemple, l\u2019application Zombies Run vous plonge dans une aventure que les spectateurs de The Walking Dead connaissent. Le monde est infest\u00e9 de zombies et il faut les fuir. Ainsi l\u2019application vous accompagne dans vos d\u00e9placements comme n\u2019importe quelle application de footing, mais elle vous incite \u00e0 courir plus vite pour \u00e9chapper aux morts vivants. Et plus vous courez, plus vous r\u00e9coltez des objets qui vous permettront d\u2019am\u00e9liorer votre camp de survivants. Utilis\u00e9e en EPS, une telle application conna\u00eetrait un certain succ\u00e8s, \u00e0 n\u2019en pas douter. Pok\u00e9mon Go, v\u00e9ritable ph\u00e9nom\u00e8ne de soci\u00e9t\u00e9, met un dernier coup \u00e0 l'id\u00e9e que le jeu vid\u00e9o serait l'apanage des gens assis. En m\u00ealant g\u00e9olocalisation et r\u00e9alit\u00e9 augment\u00e9e, l'application vous invite \u00e0 sortir de chez vous (ou m\u00eame \u00e0 courir) et, tout en parcourant des kilom\u00e8tres, \u00e0 attraper des Pok\u00e9mons. Cela est b\u00e9n\u00e9fique pour la sant\u00e9, comme le souligne cet article qui met en \u00e9vidence les b\u00e9n\u00e9fices de la marche. \u00c0 en croire le Huffington Post, le jeu inciterait un enfant autiste \u00e0 sortir de chez lui et \u00e0 se sociabiliser. Enfin, bien s\u00fbr, c'est l'ensemble des joueurs qui sont amen\u00e9s \u00e0 discuter les uns avec les autres pour d\u00e9couvrir des astuces soit par le biais de forums cr\u00e9\u00e9s pour l'occasion, soit IRL (c'est-\u00e0-dire In Real Life). Ces jeux soulignent combien il ne sert \u00e0 rien d'opposer le virtuel (jeux, r\u00e9seaux...) et le r\u00e9el (les lieux, les individus...), mais qu'au contraire l'un s'articule \u00e0 l'autre. Il y a une dialectique entre virtuel et r\u00e9el dont il est bien difficile de dire o\u00f9 elle nous m\u00e8nera. Ce centaure, il faut donc le laisser courir. Il faut d\u00e9brider son imagination et ne pas obligatoirement vouloir la faire rentrer \u00e0 toute force dans le cadre parfois \u00e9troit du programme scolaire. Michel de Montaigne a depuis fort longtemps expos\u00e9 la m\u00e9thode. S\u2019adressant \u00e0 une future m\u00e8re, Diane de Foix, la comtesse de Gourson, Montaigne r\u00e9dige un ensemble de propositions visant essentiellement la formation d\u2019un jeune aristocrate. L\u2019extrait qui suit explique quel ma\u00eetre devrait recevoir cet enfant, et selon quelle m\u00e9thode il devrait \u00eatre \u00e9duqu\u00e9 : \u00ab [...] je voudrais aussi qu\u2019on f\u00fbt soigneux de lui choisir un conducteur qui e\u00fbt plut\u00f4t la t\u00eate bien faite que bien pleine, et qu\u2019on y requ\u00eet tous les deux, mais plus les m\u0153urs et l\u2019entendement que la science ; et qu\u2019il se conduis\u00eet en sa charge d\u2019une nouvelle mani\u00e8re. On ne cesse de criailler \u00e0 nos oreilles, comme qui verserait dans un entonnoir, et notre charge ce n'est que redire ce qu'on nous a dit. Je voudrais qu'il corrige\u00e2t cette partie, et que, de belle arriv\u00e9e, selon la port\u00e9e de l'\u00e2me qu'il a en main, il commen\u00e7\u00e2t \u00e0 la mettre sur la montre, lui faisant go\u00fbter les choses, les choisir et discerner d\u2019elle-m\u00eame ; quelquefois lui ouvrant chemin, quelquefois le lui laissant ouvrir. Je ne veux pas qu'il invente et parle seul, je veux qu'il \u00e9coute son disciple parler \u00e0 son tour. Socrate et, depuis, Arc\u00e9silas faisaient premi\u00e8rement parler leurs disciples, et puis ils parlaient \u00e0 eux. Obest plerumque iis qui discere volunt auctoritas eorum qui docent. Il est bon qu'il le fasse trotter devant lui pour juger de son train et juger jusqu'\u00e0 quel point il se doit ravaler pour s\u2019accommoder \u00e0 sa force. \u00c0 faute de cette proportion nous g\u00e2tons tout ; et de la savoir choisir, et s\u2019y conduire bien mesur\u00e9ment, c'est l'une des plus ardues besognes que je sache ; et est l'effet d'une haute \u00e2me et bien forte, savoir condescendre \u00e0 ses allures pu\u00e9riles et les guider. Je marche plus s\u00fbr et plus ferme \u00e0 mont qu'\u00e0 val. Ceux qui, comme porte notre usage, entreprennent d'une m\u00eame le\u00e7on et pareille mesure de conduite r\u00e9genter plusieurs esprits de si diverses mesures et formes, ce n'est pas merveille si, en tout un peuple d'enfants, ils en rencontrent \u00e0 peine deux ou trois qui rapportent quelque juste fruit de leur discipline. \u00bb Que l\u2019on mette enfin ces enfants chevalins, ces centaures \u00ab sur la montre \u00bb. Qu\u2019on les \u00ab fasse trotter \u00bb, qu'ils galopent m\u00eame ! Qu'on leur l\u00e2che la bride ! Or le num\u00e9rique permet pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment cela : \u00e9viter que l\u2019autorit\u00e9 de ceux qui enseignent nuise \u00e0 ceux qui veulent apprendre (la machine tol\u00e8re vos erreurs, ne vous condamne pas, r\u00e9p\u00e8te inlassablement, ne vous toise pas) ; diff\u00e9rencier la p\u00e9dagogie afin qu\u2019on n\u2019entreprenne plus de r\u00e9genter d\u2019une seule mani\u00e8re des esprits si divers. Cela dit, il est int\u00e9ressant de remarquer que la technique influe sur notre fa\u00e7on d\u2019appr\u00e9hender le monde, appr\u00e9hension qui se manifeste dans notre langage. Ken Robinson, dans L\u2019\u00c9l\u00e9ment, fait observer que les m\u00e9taphores que nous utilisons r\u00e9v\u00e8lent cette pr\u00e9gnance de la technologie : \u00ab Combien de fois par jour entendons-nous les gens comparer leur cerveau \u00e0 un disque dur, dire qu\u2019ils ont perdu les p\u00e9dales ou p\u00e9t\u00e9 les plombs, qu\u2019ils manquent de ressort, qu\u2019ils sont d\u00e9connect\u00e9s de la r\u00e9alit\u00e9, qu\u2019ils n\u2019impriment pas, ou encore qu\u2019ils ont \u00e9t\u00e9 programm\u00e9s pour se comporter de telle ou telle mani\u00e8re ? \u00bb Or nous ne sommes pas des machines et c\u2019est pourquoi je voudrais que mon centaure soit un individu qui s\u2019\u00e9panouisse en des activit\u00e9s vari\u00e9es et nombreuses. Il faut le sortir, ce centaure. Il suffit d\u2019observer un peu les \u00e9l\u00e8ves lors d\u2019une sortie scolaire pour comprendre combien une telle activit\u00e9 est vivifiante et appr\u00e9ci\u00e9e. Peut-\u00eatre que cela l\u2019est parce que les sorties sont rares. Mais on peut se demander pourquoi elles sont rares. Peut-\u00eatre parce que les activit\u00e9s scolaires sont cantonn\u00e9es dans la hi\u00e9rarchie des mati\u00e8res et que sont privil\u00e9gi\u00e9es les langues, les math\u00e9matiques, etc., toutes sortes de domaines n\u00e9cessaires \u00e0 l\u2019obtention d\u2019un emploi sur le march\u00e9 du travail. Et quand bien m\u00eame ce ne serait pas le cas (lisez pour vous en persuader le beau livre de Ken Robinson), tout enseignant reconna\u00eetra que l\u2019\u00e9cole privil\u00e9gie l\u2019intelligence analytique, logique, langagi\u00e8re, mais que le reste est d\u00e9laiss\u00e9 ou rel\u00e9gu\u00e9 au second rang : l\u2019intelligence spatiale, kinesth\u00e9sique, interpersonnelle\u2026 Selon Ken Robinson, il existe de multiples formes d\u2019intelligence. Il \u00e9crit : \u00ab Si l\u2019intelligence verbale et l\u2019intelligence math\u00e9matique \u00e9taient les seules \u00e0 exister, la danse classique n\u2019aurait jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 invent\u00e9e. Pas plus que la peinture abstraite, le hip-hop, le design, l\u2019architecture ou les caisses en libre-service des supermarch\u00e9s \u00bb. Il existe donc une diversit\u00e9 de l\u2019intelligence et il revient \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9cole de l\u2019exploiter. En lisant L\u2019\u00c9l\u00e9ment, je me demandais comment tant de g\u00e9nies devenus millionnaires avaient ainsi pu \u00eatre purement et simplement ignor\u00e9s de l\u2019\u00e9cole. Comment ont-ils pu \u00e0 ce point rater leur scolarit\u00e9 ? Comment un professeur de musique avait-il pu ne pas remarquer qu\u2019il avait Paul McCartney et George Harrison dans sa classe ? Dans une de ses conf\u00e9rences, Robinson s\u2019amuse en imaginant le bulletin scolaire du jeune Shakespeare : \u00ab Must try harder \u00bb ! Et son p\u00e8re de lui dire : \u00ab Go to bed. Now ! And put the pencil down. And stop speaking like that. It's confusing everybody ! \u00bb Mais la r\u00e9ponse est probablement toute simple. Ce g\u00e9nie qui allait s\u2019\u00e9panouir dans l\u2019\u0153uvre musicale ou litt\u00e9raire n\u2019existait pas encore. L\u2019enfant ou l\u2019adolescent n\u2019\u00e9taient alors probablement que des \u00e9l\u00e8ves parmi d\u2019autres et rien ne les distinguait. Mais en ce cas, pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment, le r\u00f4le de l\u2019\u00e9cole est de favoriser l\u2019\u00e9mergence du g\u00e9nie. Combien de g\u00e9nies en tout genre ont souffert de l\u2019\u00e9cole ? Il parait m\u00eame qu\u2019Einstein n\u2019\u00e9tait pas dou\u00e9 pour apprendre des choses par c\u0153ur\u2026 Michel Tournier ne semble pas avoir connu un parcours fort paisible\u2026 Le num\u00e9rique est justement un moyen d\u2019explorer le potentiel des \u00e9l\u00e8ves. Chaque projet r\u00e9alis\u00e9 avec des ordinateurs et des tablettes met au jour les capacit\u00e9s de collaboration et d\u2019invention des \u00e9l\u00e8ves tout en supprimant la hi\u00e9rarchie des mati\u00e8res. Le centaure, par exemple, travaille les arts et les sciences de concert. Il constitue un herbier en SVT lors d\u2019une sortie en for\u00eat et en compagnie du professeur de fran\u00e7ais et de sport, il herborise \u00e0 la Rousseau et fait le calcul des calories br\u00fbl\u00e9es \u00e0 l\u2019aide du podom\u00e8tre int\u00e9gr\u00e9. Le num\u00e9rique met donc en \u0153uvre une d\u00e9marche de projet, dans le croisement des disciplines, favorisant la cr\u00e9ativit\u00e9 intellectuelle et artistique, ce qui correspond assez bien \u00e0 la d\u00e9finition du programme de cette r\u00e9forme si d\u00e9cri\u00e9e qu\u2019est celle du coll\u00e8ge pour la rentr\u00e9e 2016. On peut conclure ce chapitre avec Milad Doueihi et affirmer que \u00ab le num\u00e9rique consacre l'hybride comme aboutissement de notre culture \u00bb. Notre culture \u00e0 la fois ancienne et moderne, classique et num\u00e9rique ne renonce \u00e0 aucune exigence intellectuelle. Le num\u00e9rique fait sans cesse dialoguer le pass\u00e9 et le pr\u00e9sent, le pr\u00e9sent et l'absent, l'homme et la machine, le r\u00e9el et le virtuel, etc. Dans ces conditions, voyons ce que notre jeune centaure aura \u00e0 apprendre.","title":"Les centaures"},{"location":"%C3%89criture/Un%20Centaure%20%C3%A0%20l%27%C3%A9cole/Liens/","text":"Un centaure a\u0300 l\u2019e\u0301cole \u2013 Livre sur Google Play Un centaure \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9cole par Yann Houry (Books) Un Centaure \u00e0 l'\u00e9cole - Livre sur Kobo Un Centaure \u00e0 l'\u00e9cole - Livre sur Amazon (Kindle) Un Centaure \u00e0 l'\u00e9cole - Livre sur Amazon (format broch\u00e9)","title":"Liens"},{"location":"%C3%89criture/Un%20Centaure%20%C3%A0%20l%27%C3%A9cole/Paradigme%20de%20l%27enseignant/","text":"Il est incontestable que le num\u00e9rique donne un r\u00f4le nouveau \u00e0 l\u2019enseignant. Son r\u00f4le n\u2019est plus circonscrit au seul \u00e9tablissement dans lequel il officie ni \u00e0 la salle des professeurs. Ce r\u00f4le est encore moins limit\u00e9 \u00e0 \u00ab sa \u00bb salle. Il s\u2019est tout simplement \u00e9largi. C\u2019est ce que fait le num\u00e9rique en cr\u00e9ant des communaut\u00e9s qui s\u2019\u00e9largissent spontan\u00e9ment \u00e0 coups de hashtag. Et le point de d\u00e9part est souvent la notion de partage, un mot qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 emprunt\u00e9 \u00e0 la communaut\u00e9 du libre en informatique (que l\u2019on songe \u00e0 Wikip\u00e9dia). Qu'il serait merveilleux de voir adopt\u00e9e et adapt\u00e9e par l'ensemble du corps enseignant la d\u00e9claration du Manifeste des humanit\u00e9s num\u00e9riques qui date de 2011 : Nous, acteurs des digital humanities, nous nous constituons en communaut\u00e9 de pratique solidaire, ouverte, accueillante et libre d\u2019acc\u00e8s. Nous sommes une communaut\u00e9 sans fronti\u00e8res. Nous sommes une communaut\u00e9 multilingue et multidisciplinaire. Nous avons pour objectifs le progr\u00e8s de la connaissance, le renforcement de la qualit\u00e9 de la recherche dans nos disciplines, et l\u2019enrichissement du savoir et du patrimoine collectif, au-del\u00e0 de la seule sph\u00e8re acad\u00e9mique. Nous appelons \u00e0 l\u2019int\u00e9gration de la culture num\u00e9rique dans la d\u00e9finition de la culture g\u00e9n\u00e9rale du XXIe si\u00e8cle. Pour ma part, je me souviens, au d\u00e9but de ma carri\u00e8re, d\u2019un professeur d\u2019histoire qui avait avec lui, en permanence, deux gros classeurs. Je commen\u00e7ais tout juste \u00e0 enseigner, et ces classeurs m\u2019apparaissaient comme une somme, un v\u00e9ritable tr\u00e9sor, le fruit d\u2019un travail riche d\u2019exp\u00e9riences, de lectures et de recherches, une sorte de Graal auquel tout enseignant devait n\u00e9cessairement et in\u00e9luctablement parvenir apr\u00e8s quelques ann\u00e9es d\u2019enseignement. J\u2019admirais d\u2019autant plus ces deux classeurs qu\u2019ils me semblaient la mat\u00e9rialisation de ce qui reste d\u2019habitude invisible, le travail de l\u2019enseignant. En effet, les cours de l\u2019enseignant sont parfois intangibles, car ils n\u2019ont pas n\u00e9cessairement besoin d\u2019\u00eatre mis par \u00e9crit pour \u00eatre transmis. Mais ces deux classeurs avaient aussi un c\u00f4t\u00e9 d\u00e9risoire que leur poids et leur encombrement rendaient \u00e9vident. Pourquoi donc emporter en tout lieu et en tout temps ces deux \u00e9normes classeurs ? Ce professeur leur trouvait-il un usage quotidien ? Voulait-il absolument avoir sous la main le document qui deviendrait tout \u00e0 coup n\u00e9cessaire \u00e0 un de ces moments o\u00f9 le hasard p\u00e9dagogique vous m\u00e8ne ? Je ne sais plus quelle r\u00e9ponse j\u2019ai obtenue \u00e0 ce sujet, mais je sais depuis que le num\u00e9rique a achev\u00e9 de frapper d\u2019inanit\u00e9 ce lourd bagage. Ces deux classeurs tiennent dans un iPad. Or mon site d\u2019abord, mes manuels ensuite, ce sont un peu mes classeurs. Mais je ne voulais pas les garder ferm\u00e9s. Je voulais les tenir \u00e0 la disposition des autres, pour \u00e0 la fois les leur offrir et les leur soumettre. C\u2019\u00e9tait \u00e0 la fois par altruisme et par \u00e9go\u00efsme, car, pour plagier Montaigne, je dirais volontiers que votre approbation comme votre condamnation me seront utiles. Ces manuels num\u00e9riques sont libres de droits, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire que pour la premi\u00e8re fois on proposait \u00e0 l\u2019enseignant d\u2019\u00eatre, dans sa classe, totalement en r\u00e8gle avec la loi. En pla\u00e7ant ces ouvrages sous licence Creative commons by SA, on reconnaissait \u00e0 l\u2019enseignant le droit de copier, modifier et distribuer ces manuels. Les images, les textes, les questionnaires, tout peut \u00eatre partag\u00e9 ou transform\u00e9. Pourquoi un tel \u00ab don \u00bb ? Il faut dire et redire \u00e0 quel point le droit d\u2019auteur est une plaie pour le monde de l\u2019\u00e9ducation, un fl\u00e9au qui restreint drastiquement la diffusion des \u0153uvres. Combien de p\u00e9pites, de d\u00e9couvertes resteront dans les tr\u00e9fonds de mon ordinateur et de ceux de mes coll\u00e8gues ? Combien d\u2019ouvrages ne pourront \u00eatre partag\u00e9s sous le pr\u00e9texte que les droits d\u2019auteur ont enferm\u00e9 la culture pour une vingtaine d\u2019ann\u00e9es d\u2019abord (lors de la R\u00e9volution fran\u00e7aise), puis pour cinquante, aujourd\u2019hui pour soixante-dix ans ? Cette confiscation des \u0153uvres, parfois totalement arbitraire (songez \u00e0 cette traduction du Vieil homme et la mer de Fran\u00e7ois Bon), enferme le patrimoine culturel dans la sph\u00e8re du priv\u00e9, prive le public de sa possession, de son droit de reproduction quand ce n\u2019est pas purement et simplement de son droit de consultation. Par d\u00e9sir de profiter d\u2019une mani\u00e8re financi\u00e8re, par crainte du vol \u00e9galement. Or, dans le cas du num\u00e9rique, la confusion est totale. Si vous copiez un texte ou reproduisez une image, vous ne volez rien du tout. Vous copiez. Il n\u2019y a pas vol. J\u2019avais \u00e9t\u00e9 tr\u00e8s \u00e9tonn\u00e9 en entendant pour la premi\u00e8re fois la chanson du copyleft. Copier n\u2019est pas voler. Si je vole un v\u00e9lo, le propri\u00e9taire du v\u00e9lo est l\u00e9s\u00e9. Si je copie un texte ou une image, personne n\u2019y perd. Le propri\u00e9taire n\u2019a pas perdu son texte ou son image, mais, \u00e0 pr\u00e9sent, il y en a deux. C\u2019est qu\u2019il faut distinguer le bien mat\u00e9riel du bien immat\u00e9riel. Et, \u00e9tonnamment, le XVIIIe si\u00e8cle faisait cette distinction : \u00ab Un homme a-t-il le droit d\u2019emp\u00eacher un autre homme d\u2019\u00e9crire les m\u00eames choses que lui-m\u00eame a \u00e9crites le premier ? \u2026 En effet, on sent qu\u2019il ne peut y avoir aucun rapport entre la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 d\u2019un ouvrage et celle d\u2019un champ, qui ne peut \u00eatre cultiv\u00e9 que par un homme, et dont, par cons\u00e9quent, la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 exclusive est fond\u00e9e sur la nature de la chose. Ainsi ce n\u2019est point ici une propri\u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9riv\u00e9e de l\u2019ordre naturel, et d\u00e9fendue par la force sociale ; c\u2019est une propri\u00e9t\u00e9 fond\u00e9e par la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 m\u00eame. Ce n\u2019est pas un v\u00e9ritable droit, c\u2019est un privil\u00e8ge, comme ces jouissances exclusives de tout ce qui peut \u00eatre enlev\u00e9 au possesseur unique sans violence. Tout privil\u00e8ge est donc une g\u00eane impos\u00e9e \u00e0 la libert\u00e9, une restriction mise aux droits des autres citoyens ; dans ce genre il est nuisible non seulement aux droits des autres qui veulent copier, mais aux droits de tous ceux qui veulent avoir des copies \u2026 \u00bb Il existe donc une culture du partage, assez ancienne. Celle-ci s\u2019incarne \u00e0 merveille chez deux enseignants que j\u2019ai eu la chance de conna\u00eetre. J\u2019ai rencontr\u00e9 Ghislain Domin\u00e9 pour la premi\u00e8re fois \u00e0 Gen\u00e8ve. En ce temps-l\u00e0, nous \u00e9tions tous deux formateurs. Si nous nous voyions pour la premi\u00e8re fois, nous avions eu de nombreuses occasions de nous parler puisque nous avions discut\u00e9 \u00e0 plusieurs reprises sur Twitter. Nous n\u2019\u00e9tions donc pas des inconnus. Ou alors nous \u00e9tions ce qu'on pourrait appeler des inconnus connus... ou l\u2019inverse. Quand j\u2019ai d\u00e9couvert l\u2019existence de ce jeune enseignant, celui-ci \u00e9tait en train de r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 une autre enseignante qui se demandait comment elle pourrait surmonter un probl\u00e8me technique. C\u2019est en essayant de r\u00e9soudre ce probl\u00e8me que nous avons \u00e9t\u00e9 amen\u00e9s \u00e0 discuter ensemble. \u00c0 ce moment, Ghislain Domin\u00e9 avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 r\u00e9dig\u00e9 une premi\u00e8re version de son Guide pour l\u2019iPad \u00e0 l\u2019usage des enseignants, ouvrage compos\u00e9 d\u2019une suite de sc\u00e9narios p\u00e9dagogiques que l\u2019iPad permettait de mettre en \u0153uvre tels que Publier un podcast \u00ab vie de classe \u00bb, R\u00e9aliser un photoreportage, Cr\u00e9er et faire vivre une cha\u00eene de t\u00e9l\u00e9vision\u2026 Le livre montrait assez pr\u00e9cocement (nous \u00e9tions en 2011/2012) comment le num\u00e9rique favorisait une certaine approche p\u00e9dagogique. La diversit\u00e9 de ces approches n\u2019\u00e9tait pas la moindre des qualit\u00e9s de ce livre. C\u2019est cette diversit\u00e9 que l\u2019on retrouve - affranchie cependant de la seule plateforme d\u2019Apple - dans un livre publi\u00e9 en 2105, Les TICE en classe, mode d\u2019emploi. C\u2019est un livre qui a beaucoup compt\u00e9 pour moi en ceci qu\u2019il montre bien en quoi la p\u00e9dagogie pr\u00e9vaut sur l\u2019approche technique, une approche qu\u2019il faudra sans cesse remettre en question tant les productions de la Silicon Valley sont soumises \u00e0 des al\u00e9as que l\u2019enseignant est sans cesse oblig\u00e9 de questionner : cette application est-elle la meilleure ? Vraiment ? Et celle-ci ? Telle autre est en passe de mourir, vers quelle autre me retourner ? Telle marque est-elle compatible avec ma vision ou ma philosophie ou m\u00eame ma d\u00e9ontologie ? Comment puis-je m\u2019emparer de cette application pour atteindre tel objectif p\u00e9dagogique ? Mais par-dessus tout impressionne la volont\u00e9 et la capacit\u00e9 de l\u2019auteur d\u2019aider les enseignants. Et c\u2019est ce qui m\u2019avait frapp\u00e9 en voyant Ghislain travailler en formation. L\u2019homme se d\u00e9menait comme un beau diable, r\u00e9pondant inlassablement aux questions qui lui \u00e9taient pos\u00e9es. C\u2019\u00e9tait comme si le poste de conseiller p\u00e9dagogique que l\u2019on peut trouver dans certains \u00e9tablissements \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tranger avait \u00e9t\u00e9 con\u00e7u pour lui. Cependant, cette vision m\u00ealant p\u00e9dagogie et num\u00e9rique ne fait pas l\u2019\u00e9conomie d\u2019une r\u00e9flexion sur ce que l\u2019\u00c9ducation nationale doit ou ne doit pas faire. Cette r\u00e9flexion pourtant mesur\u00e9e avait valu \u00e0 Ghislain de graves ennuis. Dans un article de blog, l\u2019auteur d\u00e9plorait la \u00ab fascination pour la technologie \u00bb, une fascination politique imposant un \u00e9ni\u00e8me plan et une \u00ab logique massive de \u2026 distribution de mat\u00e9riel \u00bb alors que \u00ab le num\u00e9rique n\u2019est que vernis \u2026 L\u00e0 o\u00f9 on impose du num\u00e9rique, c\u2019est de la p\u00e9dagogie qu\u2019il faut prodiguer \u00bb. Remettre en question la vulgate institutionnelle n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 du go\u00fbt de tous. En la personne de Ghislain, nous avons donc un enseignant auteur, blogueur et formateur. Il ne manquait plus qu\u2019\u00e0 passer \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tape suivante. Comment aider davantage les enseignants ? Eh bien en devenant chef de projet num\u00e9rique au Canop\u00e9 de Lille. L\u00e0, dans ce qui fut autrefois le CDDP (centre d\u00e9partemental de documentation p\u00e9dagogique), des ateliers sont r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement mis en place. Ce sont de v\u00e9ritables fablabs o\u00f9 tout le monde peut venir et ainsi acqu\u00e9rir de nouvelles comp\u00e9tences. Vous voulez apprendre \u00e0 publier votre livre, \u00e0 vous autopublier plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment ? Vous voulez cr\u00e9er votre radio ? Ghislain, v\u00e9ritable sage-femme de l\u2019\u00e9ducation, se livre \u00e0 cette ma\u00efeutique des esprits et s\u2019adresse \u00e0 tout public. L\u2019enseignant formateur a eu ses \u00e9l\u00e8ves comme public, ses coll\u00e8gues. C\u2019est \u00e0 la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 tout enti\u00e8re qu\u2019il s\u2019adresse aujourd\u2019hui potentiellement. Et j\u2019appr\u00e9cie tout particuli\u00e8rement l\u2019id\u00e9e que l\u2019\u00e9cole puisse, d\u2019une fa\u00e7on ou d\u2019une autre, continuer \u00e0 jouer son r\u00f4le y compris quand celui-ci est en principe termin\u00e9. Il y a une vie apr\u00e8s l\u2019\u00e9cole. Tel pourrait \u00eatre le credo du num\u00e9rique. On continue \u00e0 apprendre et on va vous y aider. Enfin une bonne claque \u00e0 ce discours parental, professoral, soci\u00e9tal enjoignant dans l\u2019angoisse l\u2019enfant \u00e0 pr\u00e9parer d\u2019urgence sa vie d\u2019adulte sur les bancs de l\u2019\u00e9cole s\u2019il ne veut pas rater sa vie. L\u2019usager n\u2019est-il pas lui aussi un acteur de cette 4e r\u00e9volution industrielle, lui qui pourrait avoir sa petite usine sur son bureau ? Nicolas Olivier (@nicoguitare sur Twitter) est un professeur d\u2019\u00e9ducation musicale au coll\u00e8ge Sainte-Genevi\u00e8ve \u00e0 Saint-Jory. Outre le fait que l\u2019enseignant publie r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement sur son site ses derni\u00e8res trouvailles, et ce avec une bonne humeur communicative (l\u2019homme n\u2019h\u00e9sitant pas \u00e0 se mettre en sc\u00e8ne ou \u00e0 s\u2019affubler d\u2019une perruque), Nicolas Olivier s\u2019est illustr\u00e9 par son dynamisme qui a trouv\u00e9 sur Twitter un joli moyen d\u2019expression. Ce r\u00e9seau a souvent \u00e9t\u00e9 compar\u00e9 \u00e0 une salle de professeurs \u00e9largie. Et il est vrai que les enseignants discutent souvent de leurs pratiques, \u00e9changent conseils, id\u00e9es, etc. Ce genre de r\u00e9unions sur le web se produit pratiquement depuis que le web est\u2026 web. Mais ce qui est remarquable, c\u2019est que ce rassemblement ne se fait pas que sur la toile. Nicolas Olivier (et Gathy Jund) ont r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 faire na\u00eetre une communaut\u00e9 d\u2019enseignants (rien moins que cinquante pour la premi\u00e8re ann\u00e9e) qui se sont r\u00e9unis apr\u00e8s avoir suivi une simple balise sur Twitter, #EdmusConnect . Tous ces enseignants se sont rencontr\u00e9s \u00e0 Toulouse, l\u2019an dernier. Et lors de cette journ\u00e9e, ont pu \u00eatre \u00e9voqu\u00e9s p\u00e9dagogie, num\u00e9rique, programmation au travers de discussions, d\u2019ateliers, de concerts\u2026 Comment une telle id\u00e9e leur est venue ? En 2014, Nicolas Olivier se trouvait \u00e0 Ludovia (cet autre grand rassemblement du num\u00e9rique) afin d\u2019y animer un atelier. \u00c0 la fin de celui-ci, une de ses coll\u00e8gues vient le trouver et lui dit qu\u2019elle est venue uniquement pour le voir ! Les deux enseignants discutent un moment et se disent qu\u2019il faut absolument qu\u2019ils se voient, eux et les autres coll\u00e8gues de musique int\u00e9ress\u00e9s par la p\u00e9dagogie et le num\u00e9rique. De l\u00e0 est n\u00e9e l\u2019id\u00e9e d\u2019organiser Edmus Connect, ce pied de nez \u00e0 l\u2019id\u00e9e que le num\u00e9rique vous isole. Si vous tra\u00eenez sur Facebook ou Twitter, vous aurez forc\u00e9ment, \u00e0 un moment ou \u00e0 un autre, lu l\u2019acronyme IRL, qui signifie In Real Life, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire \u00ab dans la vraie vie \u00bb. Ces trois lettres veulent dire que le num\u00e9rique ne signifie pas la mort des rapports sociaux (ce qui, \u00e0 l\u2019heure des r\u00e9seaux sociaux est d\u00e9j\u00e0 une incongruit\u00e9 \u00e0 formuler), mais qu\u2019au contraire le num\u00e9rique r\u00e9unit les gens sur le web tout d\u2019abord puis dans la vraie vie, IRL. Et ce n\u2019est pas la moindre des merveilles de constater que ces gens traversent la France et parfois m\u00eame l\u2019Europe pour se retrouver. Pour la deuxi\u00e8me it\u00e9ration d\u2019Edmus Connect (en avril 2016), ce n\u2019est pas moins de 80 enseignants qui se sont donn\u00e9 rendez-vous et encore ceux-ci avaient-ils dans l\u2019id\u00e9e de former un petit groupe. Mais il se pourrait que la 3e manifestation soit plus imposante encore, car les enseignants disposeront d\u2019un amphith\u00e9\u00e2tre et de salles \u00e9quip\u00e9es (et notamment d\u2019une connexion wifi) permettant de faire intervenir divers intervenants. Ces rencontres sont fructueuses. Ce Padlet (et suivez les liens qui m\u00e8nent \u00e0 d\u2019autres Padlet et notamment celui-ci) r\u00e9unit des centaines de ressources essentiellement vid\u00e9os : histoire du violon, la polyphonie, l\u2019appareil phonatoire, la sonate, le baroque, le tempo, la pulsation\u2026 Voil\u00e0 quelques exemples de notions que vous d\u00e9couvrirez. Il y a une telle profusion de donn\u00e9es que les membres d\u2019Edmus ont recourt \u00e0 des feuilles de calcul dans lesquelles sont class\u00e9s et r\u00e9pertori\u00e9s tous les liens, ressources, capsules qu\u2019ils cr\u00e9ent ou recensent : musique et dyslexie, r\u00e9alit\u00e9 augment\u00e9e, lutherie sauvage, brain gym, Audacity, GargeBand, Philarmonie, etc. Cette r\u00e9union d\u2019enseignants \u00e9tait d\u00e9j\u00e0 une belle r\u00e9ussite, mais il a suffi \u00e0 Nicolas Olivier de lancer sur Twitter un autre hashtag (#edlangFR) pour susciter chez les coll\u00e8gues de langue l\u2019envie de faire la m\u00eame chose. Et l\u2019on peut donc d\u00e9sormais compter sur une nouvelle communaut\u00e9 d\u2019enseignants qui eux aussi se r\u00e9unissent afin de travailler ensemble. O\u00f9 l\u2019on voit que l\u2019initiative, l\u2019autonomie, la mutualisation et le partage sont d\u00e9sormais des vertus professorales que l\u2019institution n\u2019aurait jamais pu ne serait-ce qu\u2019imaginer en r\u00eave. On comprend donc la place que prennent les r\u00e9seaux sociaux. L\u2019interaction est devenue un lieu commun, mais elle est infiniment appr\u00e9ciable. Posez votre question et nul doute qu\u2019on vous r\u00e9pondra rapidement pour vous aider. Cette entraide ne semble pas vraiment conna\u00eetre de limite, car on ne saurait simplement se contenter d\u2019apporter une information quand on peut faire tellement plus. Ainsi, l\u2019enseignant dont le pseudonyme est Ticeman sur Twitter propose sur son blog quasi quotidiennement des tutoriels, des suggestions d\u2019apps multiplateformes test\u00e9es et expliqu\u00e9es. Vous rencontrez une difficult\u00e9 ? Le monsieur vous aidera et fera peut-\u00eatre m\u00eame le travail \u00e0 votre place ! Or il est arriv\u00e9 que l\u2019iPad de cet enseignant soit venu \u00e0 chuter. Un iPad qui servait essentiellement de machine de test. Comment aider celui qui vous a tant aid\u00e9 ? L\u2019occasion \u00e9tait toute trouv\u00e9e. Un enseignant a expliqu\u00e9 qu\u2019il suffisait de cliquer sur le bouton Paypal du site de Ticeman et de lui procurer ainsi les fonds n\u00e9cessaires \u00e0 l\u2019achat d\u2019une machine qui servait \u00e0 tester des applications et des services qui serviraient \u00e0 ceux qui en auraient besoin. Or ceux qui en avaient besoin ont spontan\u00e9ment convi\u00e9 les uns et les autres \u00e0 donner quelques euros pour que ces \u00e9changes puissent perdurer. Notez que la pratique n\u2019est pas rare et qu\u2019une de nos tr\u00e8s bonnes et tr\u00e8s g\u00e9n\u00e9reuses amies souhaitait d\u00e9couvrir le Chrome Book. C\u2019\u00e9tait son anniversaire et l\u2019occasion, une fois encore, \u00e9tait trop belle. Et puis qu\u2019est-ce que cela co\u00fbte \u00e0 de telles communaut\u00e9s d\u2019enseignants qui parfois ne se sont d\u2019ailleurs jamais rencontr\u00e9s ? Financi\u00e8rement, pas grand-chose. Encore que dans mon cas, le recours au financement collaboratif via Ulule m\u2019a permis de troquer mon vieux Mac contre un iMac de 27 pouces tout neuf. Cette campagne de crowdfunding m\u2019a ainsi permis de travailler dans de meilleures conditions et de produire un \u00e9ni\u00e8me manuel scolaire, libre et gratuit. Pour l\u2019occasion, je transformais la licence sous laquelle je pla\u00e7ais mes productions en licence CC by SA. Souvenez-vous de cette m\u00e9taphore attribu\u00e9e \u00e0 Bernard de Chartres nous pr\u00e9sentant comme des nains juch\u00e9s sur des \u00e9paules de g\u00e9ants. Il voulait dire par l\u00e0 que nous nous \u00e9levions par la lecture des grands auteurs du pass\u00e9. Aujourd'hui, nous prenons \u00e0 la fois appui sur nos illustres pr\u00e9d\u00e9cesseurs, mais aussi sur nos contemporains qui, gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 l'intelligence collective, haussent la r\u00e9flexion \u00e0 un stade que l'isolement dans lequel se trouvaient auparavant le chercheur ou l'\u00e9crivain ne pouvait permettre d'atteindre. Par l'aide financi\u00e8re, psychologique et intellectuelle que mes amis (fussent-ils virtuels sur Facebook), mes abonn\u00e9s (sur Twitter), mes lecteurs et commentateurs sur mon site ou mon blog m'apportent, je parviens \u00e0 un r\u00e9sultat auquel, seul, je n'aurais pu pr\u00e9tendre. L\u2019enseignant est donc moins isol\u00e9 que jamais. Il est au c\u0153ur d\u2019une communaut\u00e9. S\u2019il \u00e9tait un artiste, peut-\u00eatre pourrait-on parler de mouvement ou s\u2019il peut \u00eatre apparent\u00e9 \u00e0 un intellectuel probablement peut-on parler de courant. Et s\u2019il est bien un courant pour lequel les questions d\u2019\u00e9ducation ont constitu\u00e9 une pr\u00e9occupation importante, c\u2019est bien l\u2019humanisme. C\u2019est devenu un lieu commun que de comparer l\u2019invention d\u2019internet \u00e0 l\u2019invention de l\u2019imprimerie qui, selon la vision qui en d\u00e9coule, aurait produit une violente acc\u00e9l\u00e9ration de la diffusion du savoir. La technique serait en ce sens bienfaitrice et ce n\u2019est pas tout \u00e0 fait faux et ce n\u2019est pas tout \u00e0 fait vrai, parce qu\u2019il a fallu de nombreuses ann\u00e9es pour que l\u2019acc\u00e8s au livre se d\u00e9mocratise et qu\u2019au d\u00e9but, celui-ci \u00e9tait tr\u00e8s co\u00fbteux \u00e0 produire et donc rare. Mais \u00e0 terme l\u2019invention de l\u2019imprimerie a r\u00e9ellement donn\u00e9s acc\u00e8s \u00e0 un savoir qui restait auparavant l\u2019apanage de quelques moines isol\u00e9s dans leur coin, et qui prenaient seuls dans leur coin des d\u00e9cisions concernant la graphie ou l\u2019orthographe de tel mot seuls ou sans pouvoir ais\u00e9ment partager leur r\u00e9flexion ou leurs doutes. Je me suis souvent demand\u00e9 ce qu\u2019auraient fait ces hommes s\u2019ils avaient eu internet. Nul doute qu\u2019on y aurait tous gagn\u00e9. Apr\u00e8s tout, certaines orthographes r\u00e9sultent de choix qui remontent pour certains au XVIe si\u00e8cle. L\u2019orthographe en aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 simplifi\u00e9e. Les moines auraient pu s\u2019entendre sur tel ou tel point, s\u2019accorder \u00e0 choisir la solution la plus \u00e9l\u00e9gante ou la plus pratique. Internet aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 un moyen d\u2019unifier l\u2019anarchie qu\u2019est l\u2019orthographe. Mais le XVIe si\u00e8cle, ce n\u2019est pas uniquement le si\u00e8cle de l\u2019imprimerie. C\u2019est aussi le si\u00e8cle de l\u2019humanisme. Et, de fait, on parle souvent d\u2019humanisme 2.0. Mais qu\u2019est-ce que l'humanisme pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment ? Tout d\u2019abord, c\u2019est un acte de confiance dans l\u2019homme heurtant la conception chr\u00e9tienne qui met l\u2019accent sur la mis\u00e8re de celui-ci. Pic de La Mirandole, dans son Discours de la dignit\u00e9 de l\u2019homme, montre Adam au centre de l\u2019univers. Nu, fragile, sans armes, il est muni de sa seule intelligence qui lui assure sa domination sur les animaux. Le retour \u00e0 la pens\u00e9e antique et le culte des Anciens qui ne d\u00e9couragent pas les Modernes de rivaliser avec leurs devanciers et m\u00eame de les d\u00e9passer lui procure le sentiment d\u2019appartenir \u00e0 une \u00e9poque de r\u00e9veil spirituel. S'il admet n'\u00eatre qu'un nain, il se sait perch\u00e9 sur des \u00e9paules de g\u00e9ants. L\u2019humaniste a foi dans l\u2019avenir. De plus, \u00e0 sa culture livresque, s\u2019ajoutent l\u2019observation, l\u2019exp\u00e9rience personnelle et le go\u00fbt du voyage. Il y a l\u00e0 un \u00e9largissement de l\u2019horizon intellectuel qui s\u2019accompagne d\u2019une volont\u00e9 de rompre avec le vieux monde, un monde de valeurs vieillies qui m\u00e9conna\u00eet un nouvel art de vivre, une aspiration \u00e0 une nouvelle culture. Se d\u00e9fiant des id\u00e9es toutes faites, l\u2019humaniste se fait aussi \u00ab inquisiteur de v\u00e9rit\u00e9 \u00bb. Appliquant l\u2019exercice de sa raison, c\u2019est tout l\u2019univers qui s\u2019offre \u00e0 la gourmandise humaniste. L'homo numericus, c'est Gargantua \u00e0 table. Guillaume Bud\u00e9 est souvent pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 comme le p\u00e8re de l\u2019humanisme. Il obtient du roi la cr\u00e9ation du Coll\u00e8ge des Lecteurs royaux en 1530, qui deviendra le Coll\u00e8ge de France o\u00f9 on enseigne le grec, l\u2019h\u00e9breu et le latin. A. Lefranc d\u00e9crit le Coll\u00e8ge ainsi : \u00ab Plus de grades obligatoires, plus de licence pour enseigner, plus de frais d\u2019\u00e9tudes arbitraires et monstrueux ; des cours ind\u00e9pendants, gratuits, ouverts \u00e0 tous, le grec et l\u2019h\u00e9breu envahissent l\u2019\u00c9cole. C\u2019\u00e9tait toute une r\u00e9volution dont personne, pas m\u00eame ceux qui la provoqu\u00e8rent, n\u2019avait au juste mesur\u00e9 la port\u00e9e. \u00bb Naturellement, ce Coll\u00e8ge \u00e9tait en compl\u00e8te rupture avec l\u2019enseignement prodigu\u00e9 par la Sorbonne et les th\u00e9ologiens. Il est assez amusant de constater que les humanistes avaient le souci d\u2019aborder le texte authentique sans pr\u00e9jug\u00e9, en lisant un texte \u00e9pur\u00e9 de ses commentaires, un texte tronqu\u00e9 par des traductions erron\u00e9es dans lesquels on avait cherch\u00e9 \u00e0 tout prix \u00e0 concilier la pens\u00e9e des Anciens avec le christianisme. Les Anciens ne lisaient pas Aristote pour lui-m\u00eame mais pour le mettre au service de la th\u00e9ologie. L\u2019humaniste n\u2019h\u00e9site donc pas \u00e0 remettre en question les dogmes, les v\u00e9rit\u00e9s \u00e9tablies, \u00e0 mesurer la relativit\u00e9 des opinions et rejette la notion d\u2019auctoritas, l\u2019autorit\u00e9 de l\u2019\u00c9glise qui fonde l\u2019orthodoxie. Il recherche la connaissance, quitte \u00e0 lui substituer celle du respect de l\u2019autorit\u00e9 des Anciens. Naturellement, cette \u00e9poque o\u00f9 fleurissent les utopies est aussi une \u00e9poque terrible. Les guerres d\u2019Italie ou les guerres de religion sont l\u2019autre versant de cette \u00e9poque et de cette volont\u00e9 de retour aux sources (songez \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9vang\u00e9lisme \u00e9rasmien). Le 3 ao\u00fbt 1546, \u00c9tienne Dolet meurt avec ses livres sur un b\u00fbcher\u2026 pour une phrase. Cet humaniste, ce grand d\u00e9fenseur de la langue fran\u00e7aise, cet imprimeur de Fran\u00e7ois Rabelais et Cl\u00e9ment Marot meurt pour avoir remis en cause l\u2019immortalit\u00e9 de l\u2019\u00e2me. Aujourd\u2019hui, le parall\u00e8le avec l\u2019humanisme s\u2019impose de lui-m\u00eame. J\u2019irais m\u00eame jusqu\u2019\u00e0 dire que le num\u00e9rique est un avatar de l\u2019humanisme. Certes, on ne meurt plus en France sur un b\u00fbcher, mais on a vu des blogueurs risquer leur vie. Le saoudien Raif Badawi a \u00e9t\u00e9 condamn\u00e9 fin 2014 \u00e0 1000 coups de fouet, une amende de 225 000 euros et 10 ans de prison. La libert\u00e9 d\u2019expression co\u00fbte cher en Arabie Saoudite. J\u2019imagine qu\u2019il en va de m\u00eame pour ceux qui y enseignent. Mais quand je lis la d\u00e9finition que Wikip\u00e9dia donne de l\u2019humanisme, je me demande si l\u2019on parle du XVIe si\u00e8cle ou de notre si\u00e8cle : \u00ab Consid\u00e9rant que l\u2019Homme est en possession de capacit\u00e9s intellectuelles potentiellement illimit\u00e9es, les intellectuels de l\u2019\u00e9poque consid\u00e8rent la qu\u00eate du savoir et la ma\u00eetrise des diverses disciplines comme n\u00e9cessaires au bon usage de ces facult\u00e9s. Ils pr\u00f4nent la vulgarisation de tous les savoirs \u2026 . \u00bb Par vulgarisation, il faut entendre que le savoir devient ordinaire. \u00ab vulgaire \u00bb vient de \u00ab vulgum \u00bb et signifie \u00ab le commun des hommes \u00bb. En mettant la connaissance \u00e0 port\u00e9e de clic, le num\u00e9rique le rend accessible. Le num\u00e9rique apporte l\u2019intelligence (en latin, \u00ab interlegere \u00bb, c\u2019est faire des liens entre les choses), c\u2019est la connexion. Comme les objets qu\u2019elle enrichit (le smartphone, par exemple), le num\u00e9rique nous rend plus intelligents. Par le num\u00e9rique, l\u2019\u00e9l\u00e8ve est li\u00e9 \u00e0 son professeur lequel est li\u00e9 aux autres professeurs. Un r\u00e9seau social \u00e9largit consid\u00e9rablement les dimensions de la salle des professeurs : la terre enti\u00e8re devient un lieu d\u2019\u00e9changes o\u00f9 les id\u00e9es, les pratiques, les conseils sont transmis d\u2019un bout \u00e0 l\u2019autre du globe. En somme, le num\u00e9rique est un rapport social qui diffuse un savoir tous azimuts. Et non seulement, il le diffuse \u00e0 une \u00e9chelle jamais atteinte pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment, mais il le diffuse mieux. Selon Marin Dacos, le num\u00e9rique favorise l'acc\u00e8s aux ressources : \u00ab Quand un chercheur jusqu'\u00e0 pr\u00e9sent, dans une revue papier, pr\u00e9tendait qu'il avait vu dans les registres paroissiaux une croissance d\u00e9mographique ou au contraire une r\u00e9gulation des naissances et qu'il pouvait le d\u00e9duire de ses donn\u00e9es, on ne devait le croire que sur parole et on ne pouvait pas reproduire son travail puisqu'il fallait retourner aux archives et refaire cinq ans de consultation d'archives. D\u00e9sormais on peut techniquement diffuser le corpus avec le produit intellectuel qu'on en a d\u00e9duit et quelqu'un d'autre va pouvoir contredire, affiner et r\u00e9utiliser les donn\u00e9es. Et \u00e9videmment \u00e7a change absolument tout parce que du coup, l'administration de la preuve est beaucoup plus solide d'une part et d'autre part, en plus, on peut imaginer qu'on r\u00e9utilise des corpus \u00e0 des fins qui n'\u00e9taient pas pr\u00e9vues \u00bb. C'est en ce sens que la loi sur l'open access, cette possibilit\u00e9 qu'ont les auteurs d\u2019articles scientifiques de communiquer librement leurs r\u00e9sultats (6 mois pour le domaine sciences dures et 12 mois pour les sciences humaines) est fondamentale. Cette diffusion de l'intelligence, \u00e0 l'heure des r\u00e9seaux, ne peut \u00eatre que collective. On a souvent, de mani\u00e8re humoristique, oppos\u00e9 l'intelligence artificielle \u00e0 la b\u00eatise naturelle, mais c'est \u00e0 l'intelligence collective qu'il faut l'opposer. Le r\u00f4le de la technologie n'est pas de remplacer l'homme, mais de favoriser l'essor de collectifs intelligents. Pourrait-on jamais plus \u00eatre intelligent tout seul ? Qui pourrait pr\u00e9tendre embrasser la totalit\u00e9 du savoir, ma\u00eetriser toutes les connaissances et toutes les comp\u00e9tences ? Nous sommes oblig\u00e9s d'\u00eatre intelligents ensemble. Bien s\u00fbr, comme le rappelle Pierre L\u00e9vy, quand on parle d'intelligence, le mot doit \u00eatre compris comme dans l'expression \u00ab travailler en bonne intelligence \u00bb ou \u00ab intelligence avec l'ennemi \u00bb. La technologie introduit un nouveau rapport au savoir. On l'a vu dans ce livre \u00e0 de multiples reprises. Elle cr\u00e9e un lien social d\u00e9licieux : \u00ab [...] qui est l'autre ? C'est quelqu'un qui sait. Et qui sait de surcro\u00eet des choses que je ne sais pas. L'autre n'est plus un \u00eatre effrayant, mena\u00e7ant : comme moi, il ignore beaucoup et ma\u00eetrise certaines connaissances. Mais comme nos zones d'inexp\u00e9rience ne se recouvrent pas, il repr\u00e9sente une source d'enrichissement possible de mes propres savoirs. Il peut augmenter mes puissances d'\u00eatre, et cela d'autant plus qu'il diff\u00e8re de moi. Je pourrais associer mes comp\u00e9tences avec les siennes de telle sorte que nous fassions mieux ensemble que si nous restions s\u00e9par\u00e9s. \u00bb Et l'auteur d'ajouter un peu plus loin : \u00ab Ce projet convoque un nouvel humanisme qui inclue et \u00e9largisse le \u00ab connais-toi toi-m\u00eame \u00bb vers un \u00ab apprenons \u00e0 nous conna\u00eetre pour penser ensemble \u00bb et qui g\u00e9n\u00e9ralise le \u00ab je pense donc je suis \u00bb \u00e0 un \u00ab nous formons une intelligence collective, donc nous existons comme communaut\u00e9 \u00e9minente \u00bb. On passe du cogito cart\u00e9sien au cogitamus \u00bb. Ce cogitamus, c'est l'humain mis au c\u0153ur m\u00eame des machines. Ce qui assur\u00e9ment, \u00e0 l'image des ateliers Canop\u00e9 susmentionn\u00e9s, des fablabs, est un moyen de briser la damnation de l'\u00e9chec scolaire. L'intelligence \u00e9tant partout distribu\u00e9e, tout individu sait quelque chose et peut le partager sur les r\u00e9seaux. Le num\u00e9rique, comme toute technique, a permis \u00e0 l'homme de parvenir \u00e0 obtenir tel r\u00e9sultat qui auparavant \u00e9tait impossible \u00e0 atteindre. C'est le cas par exemple de l'\u00e9nergie hydraulique et des accumulateurs, ces poids exer\u00e7ant une pression sur l'eau, g\u00e9n\u00e9rant ainsi une pression laquelle pouvait alors soulever des charges importantes. Il en va de m\u00eame du num\u00e9rique qui toutefois n\u2019est pas qu'un outil ou une machine ni m\u00eame un ensemble de machines qu'on appelle un r\u00e9seau. Ou, en tout cas, pas seulement. Cependant, \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9cole, le num\u00e9rique a introduit une question complexe, celle de la p\u00e9dagogie. Or le num\u00e9rique, c\u2019est la p\u00e9dagogie r\u00e9invent\u00e9e gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 la tekhn\u00ea. C\u2019est accompagner les \u00e9l\u00e8ves, non plus \u00e0 pied comme le faisait l\u2019esclave emmenant l\u2019enfant \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9cole, mais librement sur les r\u00e9seaux d\u2019ordinateurs. Pour reprendre le terme de Montaigne, l'enseignant est \u00ab un conducteur \u00bb. Celui-ci doit montrer \u00e0 ses \u00e9l\u00e8ves \u00e0 quel point la connaissance est infinie, prot\u00e9iforme, inattendue. Il doit favoriser la cr\u00e9ativit\u00e9 qui est le refuge de l'humanit\u00e9 face \u00e0 l'intelligence artificielle. Faites l\u2019essai avec telle ou telle application. Demandez aux \u00e9l\u00e8ves d\u2019en faire quelque chose. Vous serez surpris de voir \u00e0 quel point le num\u00e9rique s\u2019\u00e9tant d\u00e9barrass\u00e9 de ses oripeaux techniques permet de faire de belles choses simplement et efficacement. Car le num\u00e9rique, c'est la d\u00e9mocratisation des usages. Ce qui n'\u00e9tait autrefois r\u00e9serv\u00e9 qu'\u00e0 quelques professionnels est aujourd'hui accessible au grand public. Et l\u2019enseignant ne se d\u00e9robe pas. Il ne se passe pas un jour sans que des milliers d'entre eux enrichissent le web de leurs productions. Padlet, YouTube, Twitter r\u00e9sonnent quotidiennement de leurs travaux. Il y a l\u00e0 une exub\u00e9rance gargantuesque, un d\u00e9sir inassouvi de faire cours, de diffuser et partager. L\u2019enseignant de nos jours me fait aussi un peu penser aux\u2026 punks ! Comme en 77, il suffisait de prendre une guitare et d\u2019oser. La technique s\u2019est donc d\u00e9velopp\u00e9e \u00e0 un point o\u00f9 il est possible de faire des choses qu'auparavant il \u00e9tait impossible de faire mais surtout elle a g\u00e9n\u00e9r\u00e9 une \u00e9mulation vivifiante. C\u2019est pourquoi mon livre s'adresse en priorit\u00e9 aux enseignants qui ont la capacit\u00e9 de faire de grandes choses et qui ne doivent pas laisser l\u2019\u00e9cole se privatiser. Les Coursera, Kartable (\u00e0 propos duquel je vous recommande fortement la lecture de cet article), OpenClassrooms et autres Kahn Academy ne sauraient devenir les incubateurs de ce que doit devenir l'\u00e9ducation, un march\u00e9 de 135 milliards d'euros en France. Il ne reste plus qu\u2019\u00e0 permettre \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9cole de trouver le loisir (c\u2019est le sens du mot \u00ab \u00e9cole \u00bb) d\u2019acc\u00e9der au num\u00e9rique, \u00e0 faire comprendre aux \u00e9l\u00e8ves \u00e0 quel point toutes les choses \u00e9voqu\u00e9es dans ce livre sont n\u00e9cessaires, d\u00e9sirables et fondamentales, que le num\u00e9rique n\u2019est pas qu\u2019un objet de divertissement, que, selon le mot de Philippe Meirieu, l\u2019injonction soci\u00e9tale \u00e0 prendre son pied n\u2019est pas contradictoire avec le fait de se prendre la t\u00eate. Et si on ne le fait pas ? \u00c0 l\u2019occasion du dernier forum \u00e9conomique de Davos, le Forum \u00e9conomique mondial (WEF) a publi\u00e9 un rapport sur les emplois du futur dans lequel il appara\u00eet que 65% des enfants entrant aujourd\u2019hui \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9cole primaire travailleront dans de nouveaux m\u00e9tiers qui n\u2019existent pas encore. De plus, 7,1 millions d\u2019emplois administratifs disparaitraient purement et simplement entre 2015 et 2020. C\u2019est une cons\u00e9quence de cette 4e r\u00e9volution industrielle au cours de laquelle les machines traiteront des milliards d\u2019informations beaucoup plus vite et beaucoup mieux que nous-m\u00eames. On l'a vu au d\u00e9but de ce livre, l'intelligence artificielle est convoqu\u00e9e pour r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 certains besoins. Ainsi, dans ce cabinet d'avocats, l'IA Ross travaille sur les affaires li\u00e9es \u00e0 des faillites d\u2019entreprise. Elle r\u00e9pond aux questions que se posent les avocats en puisant dans les milliers de documents juridiques non pas une liste de r\u00e9sultats mais en procurant \u00ab \u00ab une r\u00e9ponse tr\u00e8s pertinente \u00bb d\u00e9velopp\u00e9e avec des arguments fond\u00e9s sur des extraits de texte et des exemples de cas concrets \u00bb. L'intelligence artificielle est \u00e9galement utilis\u00e9e dans les banques, notamment par les conseillers qui, avec la multiplication des produits financiers, ne peuvent tout conna\u00eetre dans le d\u00e9tail. L'IA va donc \u00ab aider les conseillers \u00e0 devenir des experts \u00bb qui gagnent en efficacit\u00e9 et en productivit\u00e9 tout en am\u00e9liorant l'exp\u00e9rience client. Certains de ces conseillers sont m\u00eame pr\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9s d'un \u00ab bot \u00bb, qui r\u00e9pond \u00e0 des questions simples afin de soulager l'individu des t\u00e2ches r\u00e9p\u00e9titives et de leur d\u00e9gager du temps pour d\u00e9livrer un conseil de qualit\u00e9. Alors, dans de telles conditions, qu\u2019attendre de nos enfants ? Quelles comp\u00e9tences doivent-ils d\u00e9velopper ? Selon le Forum \u00e9conomique mondial, il y en a dix. Je vous donne les cinq premi\u00e8res : R\u00e9solution de probl\u00e8mes complexes Pens\u00e9e critique Cr\u00e9ativit\u00e9 People management Se coordonner avec les autres Un rapport datant de f\u00e9vrier 2016 \u00e9manant \u00e0 la fois du minist\u00e8re du Travail, de l\u2019\u00c9ducation nationale et du minist\u00e8re de l\u2019\u00c9conomie fait \u00e9tat d\u2019une vacance de 900 000 emplois d\u2019ici 2020. Et ce sont tous les m\u00e9tiers qui sont touch\u00e9s, car il n\u2019en est pas \u00ab qui ne soit pas, peu ou prou, impact\u00e9 par l\u2019introduction des outils num\u00e9riques \u00bb. Quelle que soit votre conception de l\u2019\u00e9cole, la croissance du secteur du num\u00e9rique fera au moins consensus. Or un rapport datant de 2015 de l\u2019OCDE affirme : \u00ab Il ressort des re\u0301sultats de l\u2019enque\u0302te PISA que les enseignants n\u2019utilisent pas syste\u0301matiquement les technologies de l\u2019information et de la communication (TIC) en de\u0301pit d\u2019une augmentation des investissements dans ces technologies en milieu scolaire. De fait, les enseignants qui ont participe\u0301 a\u0300 l\u2019Enque\u0302te internationale de l\u2019OCDE sur l\u2019enseignement et l\u2019apprentissage (Teaching and Learning International Survey, TALIS) en 2013 ont de\u0301clare\u0301 que l\u2019un des domaines dans lesquels ils avaient le plus besoin de de\u0301veloppement professionnel e\u0301tait le renforcement de leurs compe\u0301tences en TIC a\u0300 l\u2019appui de leur enseignement. \u00bb Dont acte ? Si en d\u00e9pit des plans qui se sont multipli\u00e9s vainement, on parvient enfin vraiment \u00e0 introduire le num\u00e9rique, alors on ne se demandera plus si l'\u00e9cole a chang\u00e9 ou pas, mais on se dira, en plagiant Mallarm\u00e9, Telle qu'en Elle-m\u00eame enfin l'\u00e9ternit\u00e9 la change. Et alors l'\u00e9cole continuera de permettre \u00e0 l'\u00e9l\u00e8ve \u00ab de d\u00e9velopper sa personnalit\u00e9, d'\u00e9lever son niveau de formation initiale et continue, de s'ins\u00e9rer dans la vie sociale et professionnelle, d'exercer sa citoyennet\u00e9 \u00bb. Illustration de couverture Merci \u00e0 Ghislain Domin\u00e9 pour sa relecture et dont la prose s\u2019est si souvent m\u00eal\u00e9e \u00e0 la mienne qu\u2019il en reste des bouts \u00e7\u00e0 ou l\u00e0.","title":"Paradigme de l'enseignant"},{"location":"%C3%89criture/Un%20Centaure%20%C3%A0%20l%27%C3%A9cole/Points%20d%E2%80%99achoppement/","text":"Si l\u2019on en est encore \u00e0 devoir pr\u00e9senter les bienfaits du num\u00e9rique \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9cole et \u00e0 organiser son d\u00e9ploiement, c\u2019est que la chose ne va pas de soi. Et, en effet, les contempteurs du num\u00e9rique ont dans leur arsenal rh\u00e9torique un nombre consid\u00e9rable d'arguments \u00e0 opposer d\u00e8s lors qu'on en appelle \u00e0 faire entrer l'\u00e9cole dans l'\u00e8re du num\u00e9rique. Passons-les en revue. Les salles informatiques \u29eb Les salles dites \u00ab informatiques \u00bb existent toujours dans beaucoup d\u2019\u00e9tablissements. Autrefois maintenues par un enseignant courageux qui ne comptait pas son temps et qu\u2019on r\u00e9mun\u00e9rait au lance-pierre, elles font aujourd\u2019hui le plus souvent l\u2019objet de l\u2019attention d\u2019un assistant d\u2019\u00e9ducation TICE (ce qui est d\u00e9j\u00e0 un relatif progr\u00e8s, mais un progr\u00e8s fort peu li\u00e9 au salaire). Or ces salles ont quelque peu desservi la cause du num\u00e9rique. Les postes d\u2019ordinateurs y sont en nombre insuffisant (un pour deux voire trois \u00e9l\u00e8ves). Cet article du Monde nous dit qu\u2019en 2014, il y avait 22 ordinateurs ou tablettes pour 100 coll\u00e9giens et l\u2019article pr\u00e9cise m\u00eame que l\u2019\u00e9quipement avait tout simplement doubl\u00e9 en dix ans ! Sous-dot\u00e9es en m\u00e9moire vive ou dot\u00e9e d\u2019un processeur peu v\u00e9loce, les machines connaissent souvent des difficult\u00e9s \u00e0 faire tourner tel ou tel programme. Elles deviennent m\u00eame parfois obsol\u00e8tes d\u00e8s le d\u00e9ballage du carton. Pire encore, l\u2019entreprise qui avait fourni une de ces salles peut avoir d\u00e9pos\u00e9 le bilan et le service apr\u00e8s-vente n\u2019est plus effectu\u00e9\u2026 C\u2019\u00e9tait le cas dans mon ancien coll\u00e8ge. Certains programmes ou machines ne fonctionnaient plus et on n\u2019y pouvait rien sinon en racheter d\u2019autres, si toutefois le budget le permettait. La foi dans la science \u29eb Par ailleurs, la suspicion de l\u2019enseignant face au num\u00e9rique appara\u00eet \u00e0 bien des \u00e9gards comme le reliquat d\u2019une mauvaise conscience positiviste. On a h\u00e9rit\u00e9 du si\u00e8cle pass\u00e9 d\u2019une m\u00e9fiance \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de la technique. Il faut dire que la foi dans le progr\u00e8s a pu conduire l\u2019humanit\u00e9 au bord du gouffre\u2026 Ainsi des enseignants trouvent suspecte cette croyance que la science peut r\u00e9gler sinon nos probl\u00e8mes du moins ceux de la jeunesse. Et comment leur donner tort ? Il me semble aussi que l\u2019on a h\u00e9rit\u00e9 d\u2019une m\u00e9fiance envers les \u00e9crans, m\u00e9fiance qui renvoie \u00e0 d\u2019autres \u00e9crans, ceux de la t\u00e9l\u00e9vision qui est parfois le refuge de ce que l\u2019on peut produire de pire\u2026 et de meilleur. Il y a donc un pr\u00e9jug\u00e9 d\u00e9favorable qui ne s\u2019accommode pas bien des imp\u00e9ratifs traditionnels scolaires. D\u2019aucuns se disent que nos \u00e9l\u00e8ves ont bien assez d\u2019\u00e9crans chez eux pour que l\u2019\u00e9cole ne leur colle pas \u00e0 nouveau le nez dessus. Mais pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment c\u2019est cette conception quasi monacale qui me chagrine. L\u2019\u00e9cole doit-elle rester hors du temps ? Extraire les \u00e9l\u00e8ves de leur quotidien ? Il me semble que si c\u2019\u00e9tait le cas, on enseignerait toujours en latin et les serments de Strasbourg n\u2019auraient jamais vu le jour. Toute mutation s\u2019est faite dans la compr\u00e9hension et acceptation du monde ext\u00e9rieur dans sa diversit\u00e9 et parfois de fa\u00e7on purement pragmatique. Cette vision des choses a un autre \u00e9cueil : \u00e0 consid\u00e9rer que les \u00e9crans rel\u00e8vent du domaine priv\u00e9, on abandonne les \u00e9l\u00e8ves \u00e0 eux-m\u00eames. On ne leur apprend pas ce qu\u2019est cette machine qu\u2019ils ont entre les mains, on ne leur apprend pas \u00e0 s\u2019exprimer sur les r\u00e9seaux sociaux, on ne leur montre pas la richesse que la collectivit\u00e9 qui s\u2019organise d\u2019elle-m\u00eame peut produire (pensez \u00e0 Wikip\u00e9dia ou aux hashtags comme #PortesOuvertes). Asservissement et commerce num\u00e9riques \u29eb Il existe aussi une crainte qui ressortit \u00e0 la critique marxiste : la technique serait l\u2019instrument du capitalisme permettant d\u2019asservir les travailleurs. D\u2019aucuns nous voient d\u2019ailleurs comme des digital labor, des travailleurs num\u00e9riques qui s\u2019ignorent et qui travaillent sans r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration. D'autres d\u00e9plorent que l'\u00c9ducation ne soit qu'un march\u00e9. Tout d\u2019abord, ce serait une erreur de penser que l\u2019\u00e9cole n\u2019est pas un march\u00e9. Ensuite, c\u2019est aux enseignants voire \u00e0 l\u2019\u00c9ducation nationale de faire les choses correctement : promouvoir les ressources libres, les logiciels libres ou les formats standards qui permettront \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9cole d\u2019\u00e9chapper \u00e0 la voracit\u00e9 des commer\u00e7ants. Encore que leur app\u00e9tit sans limites est, en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, conditionn\u00e9 par un imp\u00e9ratif : faire des produits utiles, d\u00e9sirables et de qualit\u00e9, sans quoi ils n\u2019auraient plus rien \u00e0 vendre. Il serait aussi dommage de se priver de tel ou tel logiciel au seul motif qu\u2019il est \u00ab privatif \u00bb. L\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat p\u00e9dagogique pr\u00e9vaut dans bien des cas. Avec le num\u00e9rique, c'est tout un mod\u00e8le \u00e9conomique qui doit \u00eatre repens\u00e9. Par exemple, le manuel scolaire, cet objet hautement commercial, repr\u00e9sente, selon le rapport de Michel Leroy, 281 millions d\u2019euros pour la seule ann\u00e9e 2010. On pourrait estimer que l'actuelle r\u00e9forme doublera ce chiffre puisque tous les programmes de tous les niveaux (du CP \u00e0 la 3e) changent en une fois d\u00e8s la rentr\u00e9e 2016. Cela repr\u00e9sente 11,2 millions de livres \u00e0 imprimer pour les coll\u00e9giens, et quelque 16 millions pour les \u00e9coliers. Si l\u2019on consid\u00e8re que le papier, ou plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment un certain usage du papier, est amen\u00e9 \u00e0 dispara\u00eetre, on peut faire le raisonnement suivant. Certes, il faut fournir les tablettes, et cela repr\u00e9sente un co\u00fbt. Mais c\u2019est un co\u00fbt que l\u2019on doit mettre en regard des millions susmentionn\u00e9s. Ce co\u00fbt ne pourrait-il s\u2019amoindrir ? D\u2019une certaine fa\u00e7on, et sans que cela ne rel\u00e8ve du domaine de l\u2019utopie, ne pourrait-il sinon dispara\u00eetre du moins diminuer drastiquement ? Ne pourrait-on envisager l'abandon de l\u2019imprimante et de la photocopieuse ? Le num\u00e9rique permet, en effet, la transmission de donn\u00e9es, de sujets, d\u2019exercices en tout genre de fa\u00e7on bien plus int\u00e9ressante que ne le fait le papier. On pourrait m\u00eame r\u00eaver ceci : aucun enseignant n\u2019aurait plus \u00e0 se ruer sur la photocopieuse encore en \u00e9tat de marche, celle devant qui deux coll\u00e8gues tr\u00e9pignent d\u00e9j\u00e0, attendant qu\u2019un l\u00e8ve-t\u00f4t (ou un retardataire comme les trois autres) ach\u00e8ve son collage pour distribuer une photocopie de qualit\u00e9 m\u00e9diocre (m\u00e9diocre parce que le num\u00e9rique a tellement mieux \u00e0 offrir) ! L\u2019abandon des photocopieurs permettrait de consacrer des sommes importantes aux tablettes et \u00e9ventuellement aux manuels pr\u00e9vus pour de tels supports. Ajoutons qu\u2019un rapport de f\u00e9vrier 1986 explique que \u00ab le volume des d\u00e9penses consacr\u00e9es aux photocopies est \u00e9quivalent \u00e0 la dotation annuelle consacr\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019achat de manuels \u00bb (cit\u00e9 par Michel Leroy), et l\u2019on comprendra que, dans ces conditions, l\u2019achat de tablettes n\u2019est pas le moins du monde inconsid\u00e9r\u00e9. Si, d\u2019aventure, ces manuels sont gratuits (ce qui existe), alors, l\u2019argument du prix de la tablette est battu en br\u00e8che. S\u2019ils ne sont pas gratuits, ces manuels num\u00e9riques sont ou devraient \u00eatre de toute fa\u00e7on quelque peu moins chers. Et il est fortement \u00e0 esp\u00e9rer que s\u2019il doit \u00eatre payant, sa mise \u00e0 jour ne saurait \u00eatre au m\u00eame prix ; qu\u2019un simple toilettage ou quelque ajout soit offert \u00e0 un prix que les collectivit\u00e9s trouveront int\u00e9ressant au point de pr\u00e9f\u00e9rer le num\u00e9rique au papier. Un dernier exemple : \u00e0 quoi sert d\u2019acheter encore et encore le domaine public ? Ces Balzac ou ces Jules Verne \u00e0 7 euros l\u2019exemplaire pour 30 \u00e9l\u00e8ves ? Ne peut-on pas les lire gratuitement sur des tablettes voire des liseuses, lesquelles ont un faible co\u00fbt ? Dystopies \u29eb Quand il est question de num\u00e9rique, les dystopies ne sont jamais loin et il est des enseignants qui voient dans l\u2019utilisation des machines les pr\u00e9misses d\u2019un avenir inqui\u00e9tant. Et pour eux, c\u2019est un peu comme si Skynet d\u00e9ployait d\u00e9j\u00e0 son r\u00e9seau. La technique peut aussi \u00eatre un moyen d\u2019asservissement des masses, ce que montre \u00e0 la fois la loi sur le renseignement adopt\u00e9e r\u00e9cemment \u00e0 l\u2019Assembl\u00e9e, mais aussi \u00e9videmment les r\u00e9v\u00e9lations d\u2019Edward Snowden en 2013. Et depuis le double attentat \u00e0 Paris, le gouvernement d\u00e9signe sans rel\u00e2che internet comme le coupable id\u00e9al o\u00f9 se r\u00e9fugieraient les terroristes de tout poil. Deep web ou dark web seraient l\u2019envers de la m\u00e9daille. Enfin, r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement, tel acteur, tel \u00e9crivain d\u00e9signent le web comme \u00e9tant \u00ab les \u00e9gouts de la d\u00e9mocratie \u00bb. Mais, enfin, de l\u00e0 \u00e0 consid\u00e9rer que le cahier de textes en ligne est l'organe de Big Brother, il y a l\u00e0 un exc\u00e8s qui se condamne lui-m\u00eame. Certains enseignants peuvent aussi \u00e9voquer la d\u00e9shumanisation d\u2019un enseignement dont le professeur serait exclu au profit du seul ordinateur. Pourtant, le documentaire de Pascale Labout diffus\u00e9 sur Canal + montre bien qu\u2019il n\u2019en est rien. Posant pernicieusement la question \u00ab \u00c9cole du futur : la fin des profs ? \u00bb, la journaliste fait appara\u00eetre que les \u00e9coles du type Florida Virtual School ou K12, dans lesquels les \u00e9l\u00e8ves sont seuls face \u00e0 leur ordinateur, sont loin d\u2019\u00eatre la solution id\u00e9ale. Ces \u00e9coles permettent certes de r\u00e9duire certains co\u00fbts (comme \u00e9conomiser un poste d\u2019enseignant), de donner \u00e0 un seul enseignant la responsabilit\u00e9 de 30 classes et de mettre pr\u00e8s de 50 \u00e9l\u00e8ves dans une seule classe. Mais les \u00e9l\u00e8ves ne travaillent pas et sont d\u00e9motiv\u00e9s. Certains, selon le t\u00e9moignage d\u2019une enseignante, ont m\u00eame fait des tentatives de suicide. Il est de toute \u00e9vidence que l\u2019enseignement ne saurait \u00eatre totalement ni partiellement d\u00e9shumanis\u00e9. Si d\u2019aventure la chose devait arriver, je suis s\u00fbr que les enfants mourraient un \u00e0 un comme ceux \u00e0 qui Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric II, voulant d\u00e9couvrir la langue originelle, avait refus\u00e9 que l\u2019on parle. La parole, le lien \u00e0 l\u2019autre, la dimension sociale de l\u2019apprentissage sont des \u00e9l\u00e9ments fondamentaux hors desquels il n\u2019est pas d\u2019\u00e9ducation. Le probl\u00e8me de la formation \u29eb Et puis il faut bien reconna\u00eetre qu\u2019il y a la complexit\u00e9 des choses : s\u2019emparer d\u2019un logiciel, se demander ce que l\u2019on peut bien en faire apr\u00e8s se l\u2019\u00eatre p\u00e9niblement appropri\u00e9, apr\u00e8s s\u2019\u00eatre form\u00e9 sur son temps libre et cela dans un domaine pour lequel rien ne vous a jamais pr\u00e9par\u00e9 et certainement pas le concours du CAPES ou de l\u2019agr\u00e9gation\u2026 En lettres, on est bien plus soucieux de vous apprendre comment la lettre \u00ab u \u00bb a \u00e9volu\u00e9 de la chute de l\u2019Empire romain \u00e0 nos jours que de vous aider \u00e0 prendre place dans le monde qui est le v\u00f4tre. Par exemple, comment se former \u00e0 l\u2019usage d\u2019un TBI ? Il faut vraiment en avoir envie, car vous ne risquez pas de l\u2019emporter avec vous pour le tester un weekend. Il ne vous reste plus qu\u2019\u00e0 essayer dans un de ces \u00ab trous \u00bb de votre emploi du temps voire dans votre cours en acceptant l\u2019id\u00e9e que vous n\u2019\u00eates pas omniscient et que vous aurez peut-\u00eatre \u00e0 t\u00e2tonner, h\u00e9siter, que vous vous tromperez probablement devant des \u00e9l\u00e8ves que vous jugerez peut-\u00eatre (mais \u00e0 tort, on le verra ci-dessous) plus comp\u00e9tents que vous sur ce point. Le manque de mat\u00e9riel \u29eb Autre pierre d\u2019achoppement, le mat\u00e9riel. En discutant sur Twitter, j\u2019ai \u00e9t\u00e9 sid\u00e9r\u00e9 de constater \u00e0 quel point de nombreux professeurs des \u00e9coles en \u00e9taient r\u00e9duits \u00e0 acheter leur propre mat\u00e9riel, y compris des vid\u00e9oprojecteurs ! Peut-on en vouloir \u00e0 un enseignant qui n\u2019aurait pas envie d\u2019acheter le vid\u00e9oprojecteur de sa salle avec son salaire ? Une fois \u00e9quip\u00e9, l\u2019enseignant doit ensuite porter tous ses efforts sur la transposition p\u00e9dagogique de la machine. La manipulation d\u2019une tablette ou d\u2019un ordinateur dans le contexte de l\u2019\u00e9ducation n\u2019a rien d\u2019ais\u00e9. Autant on comprend bien qu\u2019on peut mettre des films, de la musique ou prendre des photos avec un appareil nouvellement achet\u00e9 (on en comprend instantan\u00e9ment les usages m\u00eame si on ne les per\u00e7oit pas tous), autant l\u2019exploitation p\u00e9dagogique d\u2019une tablette en classe ne va pas de soi. Aussit\u00f4t une foule de questions se posent : comment transmettre des documents ? Comment les r\u00e9cup\u00e9rer ? De quelle mani\u00e8re les corriger ? Comment faire cours tout simplement ? On continue comme avant mais avec un \u00ab outil \u00bb diff\u00e9rent ? On change tout et c\u2019est la r\u00e9volution (auquel cas on a fait un tour sur soi m\u00eame) ? Il faut tout reconsid\u00e9rer et ce n\u2019est franchement pas facile. Une recette miracle \u29eb De plus, force est de constater que le num\u00e9rique est souvent pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 comme une solution miracle \u00e0 tous nos probl\u00e8mes scolaires. Les r\u00e9ticences, de ce point de vue, ne sont pas d\u00e9nu\u00e9es de fondement et il faut les \u00e9couter. Il est n\u00e9cessaire de les confronter \u00e0 notre enthousiasme de \u00ab technop\u00e9dagogue \u00bb. \u00c0 battre notre coulpe, on doit bien reconna\u00eetre que l\u2019on a l\u2019\u00e9merveillement facile. Cela doit bien avoir quelque chose d\u2019irrationnel. Je parlais de foi quelques lignes plus haut et dans le mot \u00ab enthousiasme \u00bb, il y a la racine \u00ab theos \u00bb qui d\u00e9signe le dieu. Gardons-nous de porter au pinacle des \u00ab technologies \u00bb (ne devrions-nous d\u2019ailleurs pas dire des \u00ab techniques \u00bb ?) qui ne nous m\u00e8nent nulle part. Pour rester dans le domaine de l\u2019\u00c9ducation (et \u00e9viter de jouer les oiseaux de mauvais augure), n\u2019a-t-on pas connu des \u00e9checs pr\u00e9c\u00e9dents ? N\u2019\u00e9tait-ce pas pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment le cas avec le Plan informatique pour tous de 1985 ? Gardons-nous \u00e9galement de penser que le num\u00e9rique fait tout le travail \u00e0 notre place ou \u00e0 la place de l\u2019\u00e9l\u00e8ve. Le num\u00e9rique est-il une recette miracle ? Par exemple, nombreux sont ceux qui affirment que le savoir est sur internet. Je trouve cette affirmation quelque peu farfelue. Pourtant, l\u2019id\u00e9e est largement partag\u00e9e. De plus, je ne suis pas certain que tous les gens qui emploient ce mot lui donnent le m\u00eame sens, mais ce que je sais assur\u00e9ment c\u2019est que le savoir ne se trouve pas dans nos ordinateurs. Si c\u2019\u00e9tait le cas, pourquoi le savoir aurait-il attendu internet pour s\u2019y r\u00e9fugier ? Il serait rest\u00e9 assoupi pendant 5000 ans et se serait pr\u00e9cipit\u00e9 dans la m\u00e9moire de nos ordinateurs ? Et si l\u2019on admet que le savoir est partout sur internet, n\u2019\u00e9tait-il pas d\u00e9j\u00e0 dans nos biblioth\u00e8ques ? N\u2019y trouve-t-on pas tout ce que l\u2019on peut chercher \u00e0 savoir ? D\u2019ailleurs le savoir ne serait-il pas m\u00eame dans la nature ? Il n\u2019est que de le ramasser. Apr\u00e8s tout, ne suffit-il pas, par exemple, de prendre conscience que la moisissure permet de concevoir la p\u00e9nicilline ? Ou encore, on pourrait affirmer que puisque le savoir serait nich\u00e9 dans un vaste r\u00e9servoir dans lequel on n\u2019aurait qu\u2019\u00e0 piocher, n\u2019importe quel naufrag\u00e9 serait un Cyrus Smith en puissance ? et qu\u2019il suffirait (autre exemple) d\u2019extraire quelques pyrites schisteuses pour fabriquer de la nitroglyc\u00e9rine. Que le monde serait merveilleux si le savoir \u00e9tait \u00e0 port\u00e9e de main, de clic et ne demandait qu\u2019\u00e0 se r\u00e9pandre dans nos cerveaux impatients. Mais on sait bien que ce n\u2019est pas le cas. Et je suis certain que tous ceux qui, comme Michel Serres, affirment que le savoir est sur internet usent d\u2019un m\u00e9chant raccourci : \u00ab Le savoir ? Le voil\u00e0, partout sur la Toile, disponible, objectiv\u00e9. Le transmettre \u00e0 tous ? D\u00e9sormais, tout le savoir est accessible \u00e0 tous. Comment le transmettre ? Voil\u00e0, c\u2019est fait. \u00bb Si c\u2019\u00e9tait vrai, mon travail d\u2019enseignant en serait dr\u00f4lement facilit\u00e9. Voici le savoir : saisissez-le. Or j\u2019ai r\u00e9cemment observ\u00e9 un ph\u00e9nom\u00e8ne bizarre. Mes \u00e9l\u00e8ves de 4e sont tous \u00e9quip\u00e9s d\u2019un ordinateur et je rechigne \u00e0 l\u2019id\u00e9e de dispenser un enseignement qui n\u2019en ferait pas usage. Je leur donne donc un contr\u00f4le sur le conte r\u00e9aliste. Dedans, je pose, entre autres, une question de vocabulaire (qu\u2019est-ce qu\u2019une confession ?), une question de conjugaison (relevez les verbes et conjuguez-les au temps o\u00f9 ils sont) et une question de cours (\u00e0 l\u2019aide de votre cours, expliquez en quoi l\u2019extrait que vous venez d\u2019\u00e9tudier est un conte r\u00e9aliste). Pour r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 ces questions, les \u00e9l\u00e8ves avaient \u00e0 leur disposition le dictionnaire le Petit Robert, un acc\u00e8s au Conjugueur.fr et le cours complet sur le conte r\u00e9aliste. Ont-ils tous r\u00e9ussi ? Je vous ferai gr\u00e2ce de statistiques d\u00e9taill\u00e9es, mais \u00e0 peu pr\u00e8s 1 \u00e9l\u00e8ve sur 3 a \u00e9chou\u00e9 \u00e0 r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 l\u2019une de ces questions, parfois m\u00eame \u00e0 l\u2019ensemble des trois. Et pourtant tout \u00e9tait sur leur ordinateur. Si l\u2019on suit la logique de ceux qui affirment que le savoir est sur internet, mes \u00e9l\u00e8ves auraient d\u00fb savoir. Ou pire ils savaient puisque c\u2019\u00e9tait l\u00e0. Mais, pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment, ils ne savaient pas. Ou, pour \u00eatre encore plus pr\u00e9cis, ils n\u2019ont pas su utiliser les informations que contenait l\u2019ordinateur. Et je pense que l\u2019erreur que beaucoup de gens commettent est l\u00e0 : ils confondent savoir et information. Mes \u00e9l\u00e8ves n\u2019ont pas su (ou voulu ou pu) utiliser ces informations. J\u2019ai renouvel\u00e9 l\u2019exp\u00e9rience peu de temps apr\u00e8s en leur demandant de lire quelques pages du Horla de Maupassant. Le lendemain, en classe, je leur ai distribu\u00e9 un questionnaire et leur ai pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 qu\u2019ils pouvaient utiliser leur livre (num\u00e9rique) mais que cela se ferait en temps limit\u00e9. Le passage qui devait \u00eatre lu n\u2019\u00e9tait pas bien long. Retrouver les informations sur lesquelles portaient les questions \u00e9tait facilit\u00e9 par la nature du document (le Horla est un journal dont les entr\u00e9es sont class\u00e9es par date). L\u00e0 encore, les r\u00e9sultats obtenus sont peu satisfaisants. La recherche n\u2019est pas assez rapide, pas assez efficace. On distingue clairement la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 d\u2019un apprentissage. Finalement, croire que le savoir r\u00e9side dans un fichier, c\u2019est penser que l\u2019on peut construire un acc\u00e9l\u00e9rateur de particules parce qu\u2019on a t\u00e9l\u00e9charg\u00e9 le manuel en PDF. Si le savoir \u00e9tait aussi accessible, on pourrait me larguer en pleine jungle avec un manuel de survie et je me mettrais \u00e0 coloniser le lieu comme un parfait petit Robinson Cruso\u00e9. Malheureusement, c\u2019est plus compliqu\u00e9 que \u00e7a. Probablement Michel Serres, lui aussi, veut-il parler d\u2019information \u00e0 la place de savoir, de cette information qui est effectivement partout : dans nos ordinateurs ou nos smartphones, ce qui l\u2019am\u00e8ne \u00e0 d\u00e9velopper cette tr\u00e8s belle m\u00e9taphore de Saint Denis portant sa t\u00eate. C\u2019est tr\u00e8s beau, mais mon cher Michel (et Dieu sait que j\u2019aime votre livre), vous vous trompez. Au prix d\u2019une belle m\u00e9taphore, vous dites des choses un rien erron\u00e9es. Ce n\u2019est pas ma t\u00eate que je trimballe dans ma poche, c\u2019est une boite minuscule contenant une bonne partie des livres ou sites web dans lesquels l\u2019homme a consign\u00e9 son savoir. Mais pour que j\u2019acqui\u00e8re ce savoir, il va me falloir un nombre autrement consid\u00e9rable d\u2019efforts que celui que repr\u00e9sente un simple clic. \u00c0 ce propos, je pense que le marketing californien nous a fait un peu de tort. Evernote ne nous pr\u00e9sente-t-il pas son application de prise de notes comme notre second cerveau ? Apple, en 2001, nous faisait miroiter ce vaniteux plaisir de contenir dans notre poche \u00ab a thousand songs \u00bb, inaugurant par l\u00e0 cette d\u00e9licieuse capacit\u00e9 d\u2019h\u00e9berger des quantit\u00e9s prodigieuses de ce que le g\u00e9nie de l\u2019homme pouvait avoir produit. Et nous n\u2019avons qu\u2019\u00e0 mettre la main dans la poche pour savoir\u2026 Oui, mais on vient juste de dire que c\u2019est faux. C\u2019est beau comme une publicit\u00e9 mais c\u2019est faux. Souvenez-vous de mes \u00e9l\u00e8ves. En fait, savoir est tellement plus complexe. Ne serait-ce que parce que dans votre smartphone, vous avez acc\u00e8s \u00e0 des milliards et des milliards de donn\u00e9es et que de la m\u00eame fa\u00e7on qu\u2019il a fallu inventer les biblioth\u00e9caires quand les quantit\u00e9s de livres ont commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 accro\u00eetre de fa\u00e7on exponentielle, il a fallu inventer des algorithmes et des moteurs de recherche et des applications qui nous permettront de puiser dans ce puits sans fond qu\u2019est le savoir de l\u2019humanit\u00e9. En fait, nous pourrions peut-\u00eatre savoir en un minimum d\u2019efforts mais nous ne saurons peut-\u00eatre jamais que c\u2019\u00e9tait l\u00e0, quelque part. \u00c0 dire vrai, combien d\u2019entre vous se souviennent d\u2019avoir consult\u00e9 la 34e page de r\u00e9sultats de Google ? On voit bien que savoir, c\u2019est d\u00e9j\u00e0 chercher (savoir chercher) et trouver et combien d\u2019op\u00e9rations successives ? Donc, trouver l\u2019information, puis la lire ou la voir, la comprendre, l\u2019utiliser, la stocker, la m\u00e9moriser et \u00e9ventuellement la r\u00e9utiliser au moment important\u2026 En fait, savoir est un processus long et difficile. C\u2019est d\u2019ailleurs pour \u00e7a que fleurissent les tutoriels sur YouTube. Ils sont, pour emprunter la formule de Clive Thompson, \u00ab visuellement \u00e9loquents \u00bb particuli\u00e8rement dans le cas o\u00f9 vous voulez apprendre \u00e0 faire quelque chose : pratiquer un sport ou construire un objet. Au reste, on voit bien que si je veux apprendre le golf ou le tir \u00e0 l\u2019arc, la seule diffusion d\u2019une vid\u00e9o sur YouTube ne me permettra pas de savoir. Une pratique r\u00e9guli\u00e8re, une motivation suffisante sont n\u00e9cessaires pour acqu\u00e9rir ce savoir qui ne r\u00e9side pas de lui-m\u00eame dans internet. Et surtout, on ne peut consid\u00e9rer que savoir serait l\u2019\u00e9quivalent d\u2019un tiroir oubli\u00e9 ou n\u00e9glig\u00e9 qu\u2019on ouvre au moment opportun. Un chirurgien, par exemple, sait et sait tout de suite. On ne l\u2019imagine pas, au milieu d\u2019une op\u00e9ration dire : \u00ab Attendez, je sors mon smartphone. Faut que je cherche un truc\u2026 \u00bb Parfois savoir (comme ouvrir un parachute au bon moment) est quelque chose dont on a besoin imm\u00e9diatement et qu\u2019on n\u2019a pas envie d\u2019externaliser dans un support tel que le t\u00e9l\u00e9phone ou l\u2019ordinateur. Et il faut un professeur pour apprendre. Bien s\u00fbr, il y a des autodidactes. Mais, pour reprendre la distinction de Michel Tournier : \u00ab [\u2026] l\u2019autodidacte n\u2019a appris que ce qu\u2019il aimait. Sa culture est limit\u00e9e par sa propre personnalit\u00e9. Au contraire celui qui a fait des \u00e9tudes r\u00e9guli\u00e8res est oblig\u00e9 de tout apprendre. Son avantage est \u00e9norme parce qu\u2019il n\u2019y a rien de plus enrichissant que de devoir acqu\u00e9rir des connaissances qui vous sont a priori indiff\u00e9rentes, voire antipathiques. \u00bb Les \u00e9tudes sont donc n\u00e9cessaires. L\u2019\u00e9cole est n\u00e9cessaire. Les enseignants sont n\u00e9cessaires, ne serait-ce que pour vous guider, vous aider, vous donner envie voire vous imposer ce que votre jeune \u00e2ge, vos go\u00fbts, votre culture, votre classe sociale ou votre religion vous am\u00e8neraient \u00e0 n\u00e9gliger. Le savoir serait sur internet ? Il suffirait de les mettre face \u00e0 un ordinateur en \u00e9vacuant tout ce que le processus de transmission peut avoir d\u2019humain ? Bien s\u00fbr que non ! Ce qui m\u2019am\u00e8ne \u00e0 battre en br\u00e8che une autre id\u00e9e : le professeur n\u2019est plus le seul d\u00e9tenteur du savoir. Notez bien que je comprends l\u2019id\u00e9e, mais si elle est juste, alors il faut fermer les \u00e9coles afin d\u2019\u00e9viter le ridicule d\u2019avoir \u00e0 convier pendant 9 ans des \u00e9l\u00e8ves pour quelque chose qu\u2019ils sauraient d\u00e9j\u00e0 ou auquel ils ont acc\u00e8s ailleurs pour la modique somme d\u2019un abonnement \u00e0 internet. Certains imaginent que les \u00e9l\u00e8ves ont tout le savoir dans leur t\u00e9l\u00e9phone, mais comme on l\u2019a vu, d\u2019un, c\u2019est une illusion et de deux, ils sont la plupart du temps invit\u00e9s \u00e0 le garder dans leur poche. Mais dans le cas o\u00f9 ils auraient la possibilit\u00e9 de le sortir, ces \u00e9l\u00e8ves sauraient-ils ? Non, et on a vu pourquoi. Et le t\u00e9l\u00e9phone (ou l\u2019ordinateur pour ceux qui en sont \u00e9quip\u00e9s) ne sait pas non plus. Mon t\u00e9l\u00e9phone ne sait rien. Il ne sait m\u00eame pas la m\u00e9t\u00e9o. Pour la conna\u00eetre, il faut qu\u2019il en interroge un autre. Pareil pour Siri (ou Cortana ou OK Google). Si l\u2019on veut interroger ce dernier, l\u2019assistant doit se connecter \u00e0 des serveurs distants pour vous donner la r\u00e9ponse que vous avez pos\u00e9e. En soi, avec son processeur 1000 fois sup\u00e9rieur \u00e0 celui qui a conduit l\u2019homme sur la lune, il n\u2019en sait pas beaucoup plus. La v\u00e9ritable intelligence informatique (\u00e0 laquelle on parviendra in\u00e9luctablement), ce serait que l\u2019ordinateur puisse dire \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9l\u00e8ve : \u00ab Tu as vu les b\u00eatises que tu viens d\u2019\u00e9crire ? Corrige-toi avant de rendre ta copie. Je vais t\u2019aider \u00bb. Mais songez que pas m\u00eame le correcteur orthographique n\u2019est fichu de vous aider \u00e0 orthographier correctement et totalement un paragraphe de cinq lignes. Et vous appelez \u00e7a savoir ? Peut-\u00eatre devrait-on r\u00e9server le mot savoir \u00e0 ce que l\u2019\u00eatre humain acquiert (du moins en l\u2019\u00e9tat actuel des choses), et devrait-on garder le mot information pour tout ce dont regorgent nos ordinateurs et pour lesquels nous avons invent\u00e9 le mot informatique ? On pourrait aussi utiliser le mot connaissance, qui avec la valeur inchoative qui est la sienne, contient l\u2019id\u00e9e de commencement, de naissance et de pr\u00e9hension du savoir. En ce cas, on pourrait alors mettre fin \u00e0 ce d\u00e9but d\u2019hybris 2.0 qui s\u2019empare de tous ceux qui affirment qu\u2019ils ont le savoir dans leur main et demander avec Montaigne Que sais-je ? Suspicion \u29eb Ce qui est amusant, c\u2019est que cette interrogation face \u00e0 la technique n\u2019est pas nouvelle et on peut remonter \u00e0 Platon qui rapporte cette conversation entre Socrate et Ph\u00e8dre \u00e0 propos de l\u2019\u00e9criture. Le premier \u00e9voque le dieu \u00e9gyptien Theuth. C\u2019est lui qui a invent\u00e9 la science des nombres, le calcul, la g\u00e9om\u00e9trie, l\u2019astronomie, le trictrac, les d\u00e9s et enfin l\u2019\u00e9criture. Notez que l\u2019\u00e9criture vient en dernier et qu\u2019elle vient apr\u00e8s le jeu. Le roi Thamos r\u00e9gnait sur toute la contr\u00e9e et si\u00e9geait \u00e0 Th\u00e8bes. Theuth vient donc trouver ce roi pour lui montrer les arts qu\u2019il avait invent\u00e9s et lui dit qu\u2019il fallait les r\u00e9pandre parmi les \u00c9gyptiens. Le roi lui demande de quelle utilit\u00e9 est chacun de ces arts. Le dieu le renseigne et selon qu\u2019il les juge \u00eatre un bien ou un mal, le roi approuve ou bl\u00e2me. Mais quand on en vient \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9criture, Theuth d\u00e9clare : \u00ab Cette science rendra les \u00c9gyptiens plus savants et facilitera l\u2019art de se souvenir, car j\u2019ai trouv\u00e9 un rem\u00e8de pour soulager la science et la m\u00e9moire. \u00bb Le roi lui fait une r\u00e9ponse tr\u00e8s int\u00e9ressante en lui expliquant que tel est capable de cr\u00e9er des arts mais que tel autre est \u00e0 m\u00eame de juger de leur utilit\u00e9 ou de leur nocivit\u00e9, et il ajoute \u00e0 propos de l\u2019\u00e9criture : \u00ab Elle ne peut produire dans les \u00e2mes, en effet, que l\u2019oubli de ce qu\u2019elles savent en leur faisant n\u00e9gliger la m\u00e9moire. Parce qu\u2019ils auront foi dans l\u2019\u00e9criture, c\u2019est par le dehors, par des empreintes \u00e9trang\u00e8res, et non plus du dedans et du fond d\u2019eux-m\u00eames, que les hommes chercheront \u00e0 se ressouvenir. Tu as trouv\u00e9 le moyen, non point d\u2019enrichir la m\u00e9moire, mais de conserver les souvenirs qu\u2019elle a. Tu donnes \u00e0 tes disciples la pr\u00e9somption qu\u2019ils ont la science, non la science elle-m\u00eame. Quand ils auront, en effet, beaucoup appris sans ma\u00eetre, ils s\u2019imagineront devenus tr\u00e8s savants, et ils ne seront pour la plupart que des ignorants de commerce incommode, des savants imaginaires au lieu de vrais savants. \u00bb Remplacez l\u2019\u00e9criture par le num\u00e9rique et l\u2019on verra combien cette discussion entre un dieu et un roi est d\u2019actualit\u00e9. Cette m\u00e9fiance que Socrate reprend \u00e0 son compte \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard du discours \u00e9crit est la m\u00eame que certains peuvent \u00e9prouver \u00e0 propos du num\u00e9rique. Cette m\u00e9fiance n\u2019est pas l\u2019apanage du seul corps enseignant, mais il est assez curieux de noter que l\u2019\u00e9cole est devenue le royaume de l\u2019\u00e9crit et donc d\u2019une technique (car c\u2019est une technique) pour laquelle les Anciens n\u2019avaient que r\u00e9pulsion. Cela devrait au moins nous inciter \u00e0 davantage d\u2019indulgence pour ces nouveaut\u00e9s que des d\u00e9bats antiques nous conduisent \u00e0 relativiser. Pourtant la technique est entr\u00e9e dans les \u00e9tablissements scolaires depuis belle lurette. De l\u2019apparition du tableau noir \u00e0 celle du TBI, du papier carbone au photocopieur en passant par la machine \u00e0 polycopier \u00e0 alcool, l\u2019\u00e9cole a toujours accueilli de nouvelles techniques. Hier, le magn\u00e9tophone, le magn\u00e9toscope, puis la t\u00e9l\u00e9vision, aujourd\u2019hui, l\u2019ordinateur, puis la tablette. En un sens, l\u2019enseignant a toujours \u00e9t\u00e9 un technophile (mais il ne le sait pas toujours). C\u2019est un paradoxe qu\u2019il faut prendre en compte : m\u00eame lorsqu\u2019il est contre, un enseignant travaille forc\u00e9ment avec la technique. Parfois m\u00eame, la loi l\u2019y oblige comme c\u2019est le cas avec le cahier de textes num\u00e9rique que l\u2019enseignant a l\u2019obligation de remplir. Mais ce qu\u2019on ne peut manquer de constater, c\u2019est que la technique a envahi l\u2019univers professoral. Si l\u2019enseignant n\u2019a pas un ordinateur ou un vid\u00e9oprojecteur, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 une fois dans sa vie amen\u00e9 \u00e0 utiliser un r\u00e9troprojecteur ou un photocopieur voire son propre ordinateur dans son propre domicile. L\u2019\u00e9cole est pleine d\u2019objets manufactur\u00e9s et donc techniques, \u00e0 commencer par le mat\u00e9riel scolaire. Ce qu\u2019en pense la Silicon Valley \u29eb Les contempteurs du num\u00e9rique \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9cole ont cru pouvoir trouver chez les dirigeants de la Silicon Valley mettant leurs enfants dans des \u00e9coles traditionnelles un nouvel argument en faveur de leur th\u00e8se. En 2014, un article du NewYork Times r\u00e9v\u00e9lait que, chez Steve Jobs, il n\u2019y avait aucune des machines produites par Apple. Le journaliste demandant si les enfants de Jobs aimaient l\u2019iPad, Jobs r\u00e9pondait qu\u2019ils ne l\u2019avaient pas utilis\u00e9 et ajoutait : \u00ab Nous limitons l\u2019utilisation de la technologie par les enfants \u00e0 la maison \u00bb. Le CEO d\u2019Apple tenait ces propos en 2010 et il faut bien reconna\u00eetre qu\u2019\u00e0 cette \u00e9poque, mes enfants non plus n\u2019avaient jamais utilis\u00e9 d\u2019iPad\u2026 Et Jobs disait \u00ab nous limitons \u00bb, pas \u00bb nous interdisons \u00bb... Le journaliste Nick Bilton voulut en savoir davantage et alla se renseigner aupr\u00e8s d\u2019autres dirigeants de la Silicon Valley. Ainsi, l\u2019ancien r\u00e9dacteur en chef du magazine Wired et directeur de 3D Robotics affirmait conna\u00eetre les risques de la technologie et ne pas vouloir exposer ses enfants. Et l\u2019homme d\u2019\u00e9voquer la triade traditionnelle de la pornographie, du harc\u00e8lement et de l\u2019addiction. Un autre article du NewYork Times citait ces propos d\u2019un employ\u00e9 de Google : \u00ab Nous rendons la technologie aussi facile \u00e0 utiliser que l\u2019on peut \u00bb (l\u2019expression \u00ab as brain-dead easy to use \u00bb est difficile \u00e0 rendre). Et il ajoute : \u00ab Il n\u2019y a pas de raison que les enfants n\u2019y parviennent pas quand ils seront plus grands \u00bb\u2026 En lisant ces lignes, je ne peux pas m\u2019emp\u00eacher de penser encore \u00e0 Socrate citant les propos de Thamos : \u00ab tel est capable de cr\u00e9er des arts mais [\u2026] tel autre est \u00e0 m\u00eame de juger de leur utilit\u00e9 ou de leur nocivit\u00e9 \u00bb. Il faut croire que du c\u00f4t\u00e9 de la Californie, on ne d\u00e9roge pas \u00e0 la r\u00e8gle. Comment peut-on \u00e0 ce point \u00eatre aveugle et voir ses propres enfants comme des futurs consommateurs de Google \u00ab as brain-dead easy to use \u00bb ? Un de ces parents (mais nous \u00e9tions en 2014) pr\u00f4nait m\u00eame l\u2019usage de Snapchat, car il lui semblait qu\u2019un tel r\u00e9seau social ne garderait pas ind\u00e9finiment des donn\u00e9es qui survivraient des ann\u00e9es durant et pourraient \u00e9ventuellement vous embarrasser plus tard. Las ! On voit l\u00e0 qu\u2019on peut commettre de graves erreurs de jugement y compris quand on est de la partie\u2026 Heureusement, il n\u2019est que de revenir au premier article pour s\u2019apercevoir que tous les parents millionnaires de la high-tech ne sont pas si obtus et se contentent d\u2019\u00e9tablir des r\u00e8gles qui ne me choquent aucunement. Par exemple, les \u00e9crans sont bannis de la chambre. Ou encore on distingue le temps pass\u00e9 \u00e0 consommer de l\u2019\u00e9cran (regarder YouTube ou jouer \u00e0 des jeux vid\u00e9o) et cr\u00e9er du contenu (faire du montage vid\u00e9o, apprendre \u00e0 programmer). L\u2019ancien CEO de Twitter reconnaissait m\u00eame que l\u2019interdiction \u00e0 tout va serait contre-productive et se demandait quelle serait l\u2019attitude de ses enfants plus tard d\u00e9couvrant la technologie. C\u2019est le moins que l\u2019on puisse se demander quand on se pose la question de l\u2019\u00e9ducation de ses enfants et qu'on ne souhaite pas les maintenir dans un monde qui n\u2019existe pas. \u00c0 ce propos, les \u00e9coles Waldorf dans lesquelles certains de ces dirigeants mettent leurs enfants ne sauraient \u00eatre tenues pour des mod\u00e8les par ceux qui en France d\u00e9clarent que le num\u00e9rique est nocif, \u00e0 moins qu\u2019ils admettent que labourer un champ ou tricoter des chaussettes constitue une n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 scolaire \u00e0 19 000 euros l\u2019ann\u00e9e. Et l\u2019attirance pour le style r\u00e9tro d\u2019une vie simple avec des \u00e9tag\u00e8res en bois, un tableau noir et des craies, des stylos (notez que tout cela n\u2019est pas bien loin de ce qui caract\u00e9rise la plupart de nos \u00e9coles) n\u2019est que l\u2019effet d\u2019une nostalgie d\u2019un monde qui a la douceur d\u2019antan. Un antan bien pr\u00e9sent. Peut-\u00eatre veut-on ce qui nous \u00e9chappe, l\u2019oppos\u00e9, le contraire\u2026 Un gadget \u29eb L\u2019id\u00e9e que le num\u00e9rique ne serait qu\u2019un simple gadget est \u00e9galement tr\u00e8s pr\u00e9gnante. Probablement cette croyance s\u2019origine-t-elle dans les pratiques de ceux qui la consid\u00e8rent comme telle, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire comme un gadget. Et, de fait, nombreux sont les usages qui en rel\u00e8vent. Beaucoup de gens ont une utilisation somme toute assez superficielle de leur machine et pensent, \u00e0 tort, qu\u2019il ne saurait en aller autrement. Cependant, Binbin Zheng et ses coll\u00e8gues de l'universit\u00e9 du Michigan ont pass\u00e9 en revue une centaine d'\u00e9tudes produites depuis 2001 et, bien que seulement une dizaine d'entre elles seulement ait la rigueur scientifique requise, l'universitaire affirme : \u00ab I believe this technology, if implemented correctly, is worth the cost and effort because it lifts student achievement, enhances engagement and enthusiasm among students, improves teacher-student relationships and promotes 21st century skills such as technological proficiency and problem solving \u00bb. Le conseil d\u00e9partemental des Landes attribue un ordinateur \u00e0 tous les coll\u00e9giens depuis 2001 et, selon un rapport de l'inspection g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, c'est une op\u00e9ration qui semble, m\u00eame si tout n'est pas parfait, plut\u00f4t r\u00e9ussie : \u00ab L\u2019op\u00e9ration \u00ab Un coll\u00e9gien, un ordinateur portable \u00bb est ind\u00e9niablement une r\u00e9ussite. Install\u00e9e dans la dur\u00e9e par le conseil g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, elle donne aujourd\u2019hui des r\u00e9sultats en termes de densit\u00e9 d\u2019usages qui ne sont atteints dans aucun autre d\u00e9partement en France. La mission d\u2019inspection g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a certes constat\u00e9 des niveaux d\u2019usage tr\u00e8s vari\u00e9s d\u2019un coll\u00e8ge \u00e0 l\u2019autre, mais, globalement, l\u2019image qui ressort est tr\u00e8s positive. Les ordinateurs portables des \u00e9l\u00e8ves sont non seulement utilis\u00e9s en classe, mais ils servent aussi pour le travail \u00e0 la maison, les professeurs n\u2019h\u00e9sitant \u00e0 prescrire des t\u00e2ches sur cet outil. Toutes les disciplines sont concern\u00e9es, mais \u00e0 des degr\u00e9s divers. La structuration de l\u2019ordinateur avec une partie coll\u00e8ge et une partie maison aide \u00e0 comprendre que l\u2019ordinateur ne sert pas qu\u2019\u00e0 jouer et qu\u2019il a des fonctions polyvalentes. \u00bb Il faut cependant reconna\u00eetre que bien souvent les enfants donnent raison \u00e0 ces adultes qui voient d\u2019un mauvais \u0153il l\u2019introduction du num\u00e9rique. Nombre de ces enfants ne l\u2019utilisent que pour jouer ou pour se prendre en photo sous toutes les facettes avec Snapchat. Si vous \u00eates horrifi\u00e9 par l'utilisation qu'en font vos enfants, je vous propose de justifier l'utilisation qu'ils font de leur portable. Ils devront dans la semaine avoir rempli au moins une de ces t\u00e2ches. Dans le cas contraire, et selon la gravit\u00e9, vous pouvez au choix supprimer le t\u00e9l\u00e9phone ou couper le wifi (ou r\u00e9guler son utilisation directement dans votre box). Les enfants devront donc avoir r\u00e9alis\u00e9 au moins un des dix points suivants : Avoir lu au moins deux articles (et avoir gard\u00e9 des notes et la m\u00e9moire du contenu), Avoir regard\u00e9 un tutoriel (ce peut \u00eatre une recette de cuisine) et \u00e9ventuellement \u00eatre capable de reproduire ce dont il est question, Avoir not\u00e9 plusieurs paroles de chansons (dans une langue \u00e9trang\u00e8re) et not\u00e9 quelques mots de vocabulaire, Avoir \u00e9cout\u00e9 un podcast (de France Inter ou France Culture, par exemple) et pouvoir en discuter, Avoir lu un livre (sur Gallica, iBooks, Kindle...) et pouvoir en parler \u00e9videmment et partager ses notes sur les r\u00e9seaux sociaux, Avoir planifi\u00e9 un trajet (avec Keynote ou PowerPoint) en indiquant une br\u00e8ve histoire de la destination, les points \u00e0 visiter en s'appuyant sur des cartes et des images (en en donnant les sources), Avoir post\u00e9 et comment\u00e9 plusieurs photos (originales/insolites/amusantes...) sur Instagram, Avoir inscrit dans un calendrier ou l'app Rappels les dates des rendez-vous et t\u00e2ches \u00e0 accomplir, Avoir produit une ou plusieurs vid\u00e9os (souvenirs de voyage, d'un week-end\u2026), Avoir r\u00e9dig\u00e9 son journal (intime/extime) avec une app comme One Day (un journal \u00ab extime \u00bb \u00e9vite des informations trop personnelles ou intimes), Avoir suivi une le\u00e7on d'apprentissage du code avec une app d\u00e9di\u00e9e. Bref, de 1999 \u00e0 aujourd\u2019hui, on trouve de nombreuses raisons qui expliquent le d\u00e9samour professoral pour le num\u00e9rique. Mais o\u00f9 en est-on aujourd\u2019hui ? Les choses ont d\u00e9j\u00e0 un peu chang\u00e9. La volont\u00e9 politique y est pour quelque chose. Encore qu\u2019elle a quelque retard sur l\u2019\u00e9nergie de certains enseignants.

On a h\u00e9rit\u00e9 du si\u00e8cle pass\u00e9 d\u2019une m\u00e9fiance \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de la technique.

Il me semble aussi que l\u2019on a h\u00e9rit\u00e9 d\u2019une m\u00e9fiance envers les \u00e9crans, m\u00e9fiance qui renvoie \u00e0 d\u2019autres \u00e9crans, ceux de la t\u00e9l\u00e9vision qui est parfois le refuge de ce que l\u2019on peut produire de pire\u2026 et de meilleur. Il y a donc un pr\u00e9jug\u00e9 d\u00e9favorable qui ne s\u2019accommode pas bien des imp\u00e9ratifs traditionnels scolaires. D\u2019aucuns se disent que nos \u00e9l\u00e8ves ont bien assez d\u2019\u00e9crans chez eux pour que l\u2019\u00e9cole ne leur colle pas \u00e0 nouveau le nez dessus. Mais pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment c\u2019est cette conception quasi monacale qui me chagrine. L\u2019\u00e9cole doit-elle rester hors du temps ? Extraire les \u00e9l\u00e8ves de leur quotidien ? Il me semble que si c\u2019\u00e9tait le cas, on enseignerait toujours en latin et les serments de Strasbourg n\u2019auraient jamais vu le jour.

Cette vision des choses a un autre \u00e9cueil : \u00e0 consid\u00e9rer que les \u00e9crans rel\u00e8vent du domaine priv\u00e9, on abandonne les \u00e9l\u00e8ves \u00e0 eux-m\u00eames.

D\u2019aucuns nous voient d\u2019ailleurs comme des digital labor, des travailleurs num\u00e9riques qui s\u2019ignorent et qui travaillent sans r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration. D'autres d\u00e9plorent que l'\u00c9ducation ne soit qu'un march\u00e9. Tout d\u2019abord, ce serait une erreur de penser que l\u2019\u00e9cole n\u2019est pas un march\u00e9. Ensuite, c\u2019est aux enseignants voire \u00e0 l\u2019\u00c9ducation nationale de faire les choses correctement : promouvoir les ressources libres, les logiciels libres ou les formats standards qui permettront \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9cole d\u2019\u00e9chapper \u00e0 la voracit\u00e9 des commer\u00e7ants. Encore que leur app\u00e9tit sans limites est, en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, conditionn\u00e9 par un imp\u00e9ratif : faire des produits utiles, d\u00e9sirables et de qualit\u00e9, sans quoi ils n\u2019auraient plus rien \u00e0 vendre. Il serait aussi dommage de se priver de tel ou tel logiciel au seul motif qu\u2019il est \u00ab privatif \u00bb. L\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat p\u00e9dagogique pr\u00e9vaut dans bien des cas. Avec le num\u00e9rique, c'est tout un mod\u00e8le \u00e9conomique qui doit \u00eatre repens\u00e9. Par exemple, le manuel scolaire, cet objet hautement commercial, repr\u00e9sente, selon le rapport de Michel Leroy, 281 millions d\u2019euros pour la seule ann\u00e9e 2010. On pourrait estimer que l'actuelle r\u00e9forme doublera ce chiffre puisque tous les programmes de tous les niveaux (du CP \u00e0 la 3e) changent en une fois d\u00e8s la rentr\u00e9e 2016. Cela repr\u00e9sente 11,2 millions de livres \u00e0 imprimer pour les coll\u00e9giens, et quelque 16 millions pour les \u00e9coliers. Si l\u2019on consid\u00e8re que le papier, ou plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment un certain usage du papier, est amen\u00e9 \u00e0 dispara\u00eetre, on peut faire le raisonnement suivant. Certes, il faut fournir les tablettes, et cela repr\u00e9sente un co\u00fbt. Mais c\u2019est un co\u00fbt que l\u2019on doit mettre en regard des millions susmentionn\u00e9s. Ce co\u00fbt ne pourrait-il s\u2019amoindrir ? D\u2019une certaine fa\u00e7on, et sans que cela ne rel\u00e8ve du domaine de l\u2019utopie, ne pourrait-il sinon dispara\u00eetre du moins diminuer drastiquement ? Ne pourrait-on envisager l'abandon de l\u2019imprimante et de la photocopieuse ? Le num\u00e9rique permet, en effet, la transmission de donn\u00e9es, de sujets, d\u2019exercices en tout genre de fa\u00e7on bien plus int\u00e9ressante que ne le fait le papier. On pourrait m\u00eame r\u00eaver ceci : aucun enseignant n\u2019aurait plus \u00e0 se ruer sur la photocopieuse encore en \u00e9tat de marche, celle devant qui deux coll\u00e8gues tr\u00e9pignent d\u00e9j\u00e0, attendant qu\u2019un l\u00e8ve-t\u00f4t (ou un retardataire comme les trois autres) ach\u00e8ve son collage pour distribuer une photocopie de qualit\u00e9 m\u00e9diocre (m\u00e9diocre parce que le num\u00e9rique a tellement mieux \u00e0 offrir) ! L\u2019abandon des photocopieurs permettrait de consacrer des sommes importantes aux tablettes et \u00e9ventuellement aux manuels pr\u00e9vus pour de tels supports. Ajoutons qu\u2019un rapport de f\u00e9vrier 1986 explique que \u00ab le volume des d\u00e9penses consacr\u00e9es aux photocopies est \u00e9quivalent \u00e0 la dotation annuelle consacr\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019achat de manuels \u00bb (cit\u00e9 par Michel Leroy), et l\u2019on comprendra que, dans ces conditions, l\u2019achat de tablettes n\u2019est pas le moins du monde inconsid\u00e9r\u00e9. Si, d\u2019aventure, ces manuels sont gratuits (ce qui existe), alors, l\u2019argument du prix de la tablette est battu en br\u00e8che. S\u2019ils ne sont pas gratuits, ces manuels num\u00e9riques sont ou devraient \u00eatre de toute fa\u00e7on quelque peu moins chers. Et il est fortement \u00e0 esp\u00e9rer que s\u2019il doit \u00eatre payant, sa mise \u00e0 jour ne saurait \u00eatre au m\u00eame prix ; qu\u2019un simple toilettage ou quelque ajout soit offert \u00e0 un prix que les collectivit\u00e9s trouveront int\u00e9ressant au point de pr\u00e9f\u00e9rer le num\u00e9rique au papier. Un dernier exemple : \u00e0 quoi sert d\u2019acheter encore et encore le domaine public ? Ces Balzac ou ces Jules Verne \u00e0 7 euros l\u2019exemplaire pour 30 \u00e9l\u00e8ves ?

Et pour eux, c\u2019est un peu comme si Skynet d\u00e9ployait d\u00e9j\u00e0 son r\u00e9seau.

Posant pernicieusement la question \u00ab \u00c9cole du futur : la fin des profs ? \u00bb, la journaliste fait appara\u00eetre que les \u00e9coles du type Florida Virtual School ou K12, dans lesquels les \u00e9l\u00e8ves sont seuls face \u00e0 leur ordinateur, sont loin d\u2019\u00eatre la solution id\u00e9ale. Ces \u00e9coles permettent certes de r\u00e9duire certains co\u00fbts (comme \u00e9conomiser un poste d\u2019enseignant), de donner \u00e0 un seul enseignant la responsabilit\u00e9 de 30 classes et de mettre pr\u00e8s de 50 \u00e9l\u00e8ves dans une seule classe.

Il faut tout reconsid\u00e9rer et ce n\u2019est franchement pas facile.","title":"Le manque de mat\u00e9riel"},{"location":"%C3%89criture/Un%20Centaure%20%C3%A0%20l%27%C3%A9cole/Points%20d%E2%80%99achoppement/#une-recette-miracle","text":"De plus, force est de constater que le num\u00e9rique est souvent pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 comme une solution miracle \u00e0 tous nos probl\u00e8mes scolaires. Les r\u00e9ticences, de ce point de vue, ne sont pas d\u00e9nu\u00e9es de fondement et il faut les \u00e9couter. Il est n\u00e9cessaire de les confronter \u00e0 notre enthousiasme de \u00ab technop\u00e9dagogue \u00bb. \u00c0 battre notre coulpe, on doit bien reconna\u00eetre que l\u2019on a l\u2019\u00e9merveillement facile. Cela doit bien avoir quelque chose d\u2019irrationnel. Je parlais de foi quelques lignes plus haut et dans le mot \u00ab enthousiasme \u00bb, il y a la racine \u00ab theos \u00bb qui d\u00e9signe le dieu. Gardons-nous de porter au pinacle des \u00ab technologies \u00bb (ne devrions-nous d\u2019ailleurs pas dire des \u00ab techniques \u00bb ?) qui ne nous m\u00e8nent nulle part. Pour rester dans le domaine de l\u2019\u00c9ducation (et \u00e9viter de jouer les oiseaux de mauvais augure), n\u2019a-t-on pas connu des \u00e9checs pr\u00e9c\u00e9dents ? N\u2019\u00e9tait-ce pas pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment le cas avec le Plan informatique pour tous de 1985 ? Gardons-nous \u00e9galement de penser que le num\u00e9rique fait tout le travail \u00e0 notre place ou \u00e0 la place de l\u2019\u00e9l\u00e8ve. Le num\u00e9rique est-il une recette miracle ? Par exemple, nombreux sont ceux qui affirment que le savoir est sur internet. Je trouve cette affirmation quelque peu farfelue. Pourtant, l\u2019id\u00e9e est largement partag\u00e9e. De plus, je ne suis pas certain que tous les gens qui emploient ce mot lui donnent le m\u00eame sens, mais ce que je sais assur\u00e9ment c\u2019est que le savoir ne se trouve pas dans nos ordinateurs. Si c\u2019\u00e9tait le cas, pourquoi le savoir aurait-il attendu internet pour s\u2019y r\u00e9fugier ? Il serait rest\u00e9 assoupi pendant 5000 ans et se serait pr\u00e9cipit\u00e9 dans la m\u00e9moire de nos ordinateurs ? Et si l\u2019on admet que le savoir est partout sur internet, n\u2019\u00e9tait-il pas d\u00e9j\u00e0 dans nos biblioth\u00e8ques ? N\u2019y trouve-t-on pas tout ce que l\u2019on peut chercher \u00e0 savoir ? D\u2019ailleurs le savoir ne serait-il pas m\u00eame dans la nature ? Il n\u2019est que de le ramasser. Apr\u00e8s tout, ne suffit-il pas, par exemple, de prendre conscience que la moisissure permet de concevoir la p\u00e9nicilline ? Ou encore, on pourrait affirmer que puisque le savoir serait nich\u00e9 dans un vaste r\u00e9servoir dans lequel on n\u2019aurait qu\u2019\u00e0 piocher, n\u2019importe quel naufrag\u00e9 serait un Cyrus Smith en puissance ? et qu\u2019il suffirait (autre exemple) d\u2019extraire quelques pyrites schisteuses pour fabriquer de la nitroglyc\u00e9rine. Que le monde serait merveilleux si le savoir \u00e9tait \u00e0 port\u00e9e de main, de clic et ne demandait qu\u2019\u00e0 se r\u00e9pandre dans nos cerveaux impatients. Mais on sait bien que ce n\u2019est pas le cas. Et je suis certain que tous ceux qui, comme Michel Serres, affirment que le savoir est sur internet usent d\u2019un m\u00e9chant raccourci : \u00ab Le savoir ? Le voil\u00e0, partout sur la Toile, disponible, objectiv\u00e9. Le transmettre \u00e0 tous ? D\u00e9sormais, tout le savoir est accessible \u00e0 tous. Comment le transmettre ? Voil\u00e0, c\u2019est fait. \u00bb Si c\u2019\u00e9tait vrai, mon travail d\u2019enseignant en serait dr\u00f4lement facilit\u00e9. Voici le savoir : saisissez-le. Or j\u2019ai r\u00e9cemment observ\u00e9 un ph\u00e9nom\u00e8ne bizarre. Mes \u00e9l\u00e8ves de 4e sont tous \u00e9quip\u00e9s d\u2019un ordinateur et je rechigne \u00e0 l\u2019id\u00e9e de dispenser un enseignement qui n\u2019en ferait pas usage. Je leur donne donc un contr\u00f4le sur le conte r\u00e9aliste. Dedans, je pose, entre autres, une question de vocabulaire (qu\u2019est-ce qu\u2019une confession ?), une question de conjugaison (relevez les verbes et conjuguez-les au temps o\u00f9 ils sont) et une question de cours (\u00e0 l\u2019aide de votre cours, expliquez en quoi l\u2019extrait que vous venez d\u2019\u00e9tudier est un conte r\u00e9aliste). Pour r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 ces questions, les \u00e9l\u00e8ves avaient \u00e0 leur disposition le dictionnaire le Petit Robert, un acc\u00e8s au Conjugueur.fr et le cours complet sur le conte r\u00e9aliste. Ont-ils tous r\u00e9ussi ? Je vous ferai gr\u00e2ce de statistiques d\u00e9taill\u00e9es, mais \u00e0 peu pr\u00e8s 1 \u00e9l\u00e8ve sur 3 a \u00e9chou\u00e9 \u00e0 r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 l\u2019une de ces questions, parfois m\u00eame \u00e0 l\u2019ensemble des trois. Et pourtant tout \u00e9tait sur leur ordinateur. Si l\u2019on suit la logique de ceux qui affirment que le savoir est sur internet, mes \u00e9l\u00e8ves auraient d\u00fb savoir. Ou pire ils savaient puisque c\u2019\u00e9tait l\u00e0. Mais, pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment, ils ne savaient pas. Ou, pour \u00eatre encore plus pr\u00e9cis, ils n\u2019ont pas su utiliser les informations que contenait l\u2019ordinateur. Et je pense que l\u2019erreur que beaucoup de gens commettent est l\u00e0 : ils confondent savoir et information. Mes \u00e9l\u00e8ves n\u2019ont pas su (ou voulu ou pu) utiliser ces informations. J\u2019ai renouvel\u00e9 l\u2019exp\u00e9rience peu de temps apr\u00e8s en leur demandant de lire quelques pages du Horla de Maupassant. Le lendemain, en classe, je leur ai distribu\u00e9 un questionnaire et leur ai pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 qu\u2019ils pouvaient utiliser leur livre (num\u00e9rique) mais que cela se ferait en temps limit\u00e9. Le passage qui devait \u00eatre lu n\u2019\u00e9tait pas bien long. Retrouver les informations sur lesquelles portaient les questions \u00e9tait facilit\u00e9 par la nature du document (le Horla est un journal dont les entr\u00e9es sont class\u00e9es par date). L\u00e0 encore, les r\u00e9sultats obtenus sont peu satisfaisants. La recherche n\u2019est pas assez rapide, pas assez efficace. On distingue clairement la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 d\u2019un apprentissage. Finalement, croire que le savoir r\u00e9side dans un fichier, c\u2019est penser que l\u2019on peut construire un acc\u00e9l\u00e9rateur de particules parce qu\u2019on a t\u00e9l\u00e9charg\u00e9 le manuel en PDF. Si le savoir \u00e9tait aussi accessible, on pourrait me larguer en pleine jungle avec un manuel de survie et je me mettrais \u00e0 coloniser le lieu comme un parfait petit Robinson Cruso\u00e9. Malheureusement, c\u2019est plus compliqu\u00e9 que \u00e7a. Probablement Michel Serres, lui aussi, veut-il parler d\u2019information \u00e0 la place de savoir, de cette information qui est effectivement partout : dans nos ordinateurs ou nos smartphones, ce qui l\u2019am\u00e8ne \u00e0 d\u00e9velopper cette tr\u00e8s belle m\u00e9taphore de Saint Denis portant sa t\u00eate. C\u2019est tr\u00e8s beau, mais mon cher Michel (et Dieu sait que j\u2019aime votre livre), vous vous trompez. Au prix d\u2019une belle m\u00e9taphore, vous dites des choses un rien erron\u00e9es. Ce n\u2019est pas ma t\u00eate que je trimballe dans ma poche, c\u2019est une boite minuscule contenant une bonne partie des livres ou sites web dans lesquels l\u2019homme a consign\u00e9 son savoir. Mais pour que j\u2019acqui\u00e8re ce savoir, il va me falloir un nombre autrement consid\u00e9rable d\u2019efforts que celui que repr\u00e9sente un simple clic. \u00c0 ce propos, je pense que le marketing californien nous a fait un peu de tort. Evernote ne nous pr\u00e9sente-t-il pas son application de prise de notes comme notre second cerveau ? Apple, en 2001, nous faisait miroiter ce vaniteux plaisir de contenir dans notre poche \u00ab a thousand songs \u00bb, inaugurant par l\u00e0 cette d\u00e9licieuse capacit\u00e9 d\u2019h\u00e9berger des quantit\u00e9s prodigieuses de ce que le g\u00e9nie de l\u2019homme pouvait avoir produit. Et nous n\u2019avons qu\u2019\u00e0 mettre la main dans la poche pour savoir\u2026 Oui, mais on vient juste de dire que c\u2019est faux. C\u2019est beau comme une publicit\u00e9 mais c\u2019est faux. Souvenez-vous de mes \u00e9l\u00e8ves. En fait, savoir est tellement plus complexe. Ne serait-ce que parce que dans votre smartphone, vous avez acc\u00e8s \u00e0 des milliards et des milliards de donn\u00e9es et que de la m\u00eame fa\u00e7on qu\u2019il a fallu inventer les biblioth\u00e9caires quand les quantit\u00e9s de livres ont commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 accro\u00eetre de fa\u00e7on exponentielle, il a fallu inventer des algorithmes et des moteurs de recherche et des applications qui nous permettront de puiser dans ce puits sans fond qu\u2019est le savoir de l\u2019humanit\u00e9. En fait, nous pourrions peut-\u00eatre savoir en un minimum d\u2019efforts mais nous ne saurons peut-\u00eatre jamais que c\u2019\u00e9tait l\u00e0, quelque part. \u00c0 dire vrai, combien d\u2019entre vous se souviennent d\u2019avoir consult\u00e9 la 34e page de r\u00e9sultats de Google ? On voit bien que savoir, c\u2019est d\u00e9j\u00e0 chercher (savoir chercher) et trouver et combien d\u2019op\u00e9rations successives ? Donc, trouver l\u2019information, puis la lire ou la voir, la comprendre, l\u2019utiliser, la stocker, la m\u00e9moriser et \u00e9ventuellement la r\u00e9utiliser au moment important\u2026 En fait, savoir est un processus long et difficile. C\u2019est d\u2019ailleurs pour \u00e7a que fleurissent les tutoriels sur YouTube. Ils sont, pour emprunter la formule de Clive Thompson, \u00ab visuellement \u00e9loquents \u00bb particuli\u00e8rement dans le cas o\u00f9 vous voulez apprendre \u00e0 faire quelque chose : pratiquer un sport ou construire un objet. Au reste, on voit bien que si je veux apprendre le golf ou le tir \u00e0 l\u2019arc, la seule diffusion d\u2019une vid\u00e9o sur YouTube ne me permettra pas de savoir. Une pratique r\u00e9guli\u00e8re, une motivation suffisante sont n\u00e9cessaires pour acqu\u00e9rir ce savoir qui ne r\u00e9side pas de lui-m\u00eame dans internet. Et surtout, on ne peut consid\u00e9rer que savoir serait l\u2019\u00e9quivalent d\u2019un tiroir oubli\u00e9 ou n\u00e9glig\u00e9 qu\u2019on ouvre au moment opportun. Un chirurgien, par exemple, sait et sait tout de suite. On ne l\u2019imagine pas, au milieu d\u2019une op\u00e9ration dire : \u00ab Attendez, je sors mon smartphone. Faut que je cherche un truc\u2026 \u00bb Parfois savoir (comme ouvrir un parachute au bon moment) est quelque chose dont on a besoin imm\u00e9diatement et qu\u2019on n\u2019a pas envie d\u2019externaliser dans un support tel que le t\u00e9l\u00e9phone ou l\u2019ordinateur. Et il faut un professeur pour apprendre. Bien s\u00fbr, il y a des autodidactes. Mais, pour reprendre la distinction de Michel Tournier : \u00ab [\u2026] l\u2019autodidacte n\u2019a appris que ce qu\u2019il aimait. Sa culture est limit\u00e9e par sa propre personnalit\u00e9. Au contraire celui qui a fait des \u00e9tudes r\u00e9guli\u00e8res est oblig\u00e9 de tout apprendre. Son avantage est \u00e9norme parce qu\u2019il n\u2019y a rien de plus enrichissant que de devoir acqu\u00e9rir des connaissances qui vous sont a priori indiff\u00e9rentes, voire antipathiques. \u00bb Les \u00e9tudes sont donc n\u00e9cessaires. L\u2019\u00e9cole est n\u00e9cessaire. Les enseignants sont n\u00e9cessaires, ne serait-ce que pour vous guider, vous aider, vous donner envie voire vous imposer ce que votre jeune \u00e2ge, vos go\u00fbts, votre culture, votre classe sociale ou votre religion vous am\u00e8neraient \u00e0 n\u00e9gliger. Le savoir serait sur internet ? Il suffirait de les mettre face \u00e0 un ordinateur en \u00e9vacuant tout ce que le processus de transmission peut avoir d\u2019humain ? Bien s\u00fbr que non ! Ce qui m\u2019am\u00e8ne \u00e0 battre en br\u00e8che une autre id\u00e9e : le professeur n\u2019est plus le seul d\u00e9tenteur du savoir. Notez bien que je comprends l\u2019id\u00e9e, mais si elle est juste, alors il faut fermer les \u00e9coles afin d\u2019\u00e9viter le ridicule d\u2019avoir \u00e0 convier pendant 9 ans des \u00e9l\u00e8ves pour quelque chose qu\u2019ils sauraient d\u00e9j\u00e0 ou auquel ils ont acc\u00e8s ailleurs pour la modique somme d\u2019un abonnement \u00e0 internet. Certains imaginent que les \u00e9l\u00e8ves ont tout le savoir dans leur t\u00e9l\u00e9phone, mais comme on l\u2019a vu, d\u2019un, c\u2019est une illusion et de deux, ils sont la plupart du temps invit\u00e9s \u00e0 le garder dans leur poche. Mais dans le cas o\u00f9 ils auraient la possibilit\u00e9 de le sortir, ces \u00e9l\u00e8ves sauraient-ils ? Non, et on a vu pourquoi. Et le t\u00e9l\u00e9phone (ou l\u2019ordinateur pour ceux qui en sont \u00e9quip\u00e9s) ne sait pas non plus. Mon t\u00e9l\u00e9phone ne sait rien. Il ne sait m\u00eame pas la m\u00e9t\u00e9o. Pour la conna\u00eetre, il faut qu\u2019il en interroge un autre. Pareil pour Siri (ou Cortana ou OK Google). Si l\u2019on veut interroger ce dernier, l\u2019assistant doit se connecter \u00e0 des serveurs distants pour vous donner la r\u00e9ponse que vous avez pos\u00e9e. En soi, avec son processeur 1000 fois sup\u00e9rieur \u00e0 celui qui a conduit l\u2019homme sur la lune, il n\u2019en sait pas beaucoup plus. La v\u00e9ritable intelligence informatique (\u00e0 laquelle on parviendra in\u00e9luctablement), ce serait que l\u2019ordinateur puisse dire \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9l\u00e8ve : \u00ab Tu as vu les b\u00eatises que tu viens d\u2019\u00e9crire ? Corrige-toi avant de rendre ta copie. Je vais t\u2019aider \u00bb. Mais songez que pas m\u00eame le correcteur orthographique n\u2019est fichu de vous aider \u00e0 orthographier correctement et totalement un paragraphe de cinq lignes. Et vous appelez \u00e7a savoir ? Peut-\u00eatre devrait-on r\u00e9server le mot savoir \u00e0 ce que l\u2019\u00eatre humain acquiert (du moins en l\u2019\u00e9tat actuel des choses), et devrait-on garder le mot information pour tout ce dont regorgent nos ordinateurs et pour lesquels nous avons invent\u00e9 le mot informatique ? On pourrait aussi utiliser le mot connaissance, qui avec la valeur inchoative qui est la sienne, contient l\u2019id\u00e9e de commencement, de naissance et de pr\u00e9hension du savoir. En ce cas, on pourrait alors mettre fin \u00e0 ce d\u00e9but d\u2019hybris 2.0 qui s\u2019empare de tous ceux qui affirment qu\u2019ils ont le savoir dans leur main et demander avec Montaigne Que sais-je ?","title":"Une recette miracle"},{"location":"%C3%89criture/Un%20Centaure%20%C3%A0%20l%27%C3%A9cole/Points%20d%E2%80%99achoppement/#suspicion","text":"Ce qui est amusant, c\u2019est que cette interrogation face \u00e0 la technique n\u2019est pas nouvelle et on peut remonter \u00e0 Platon qui rapporte cette conversation entre Socrate et Ph\u00e8dre \u00e0 propos de l\u2019\u00e9criture. Le premier \u00e9voque le dieu \u00e9gyptien Theuth. C\u2019est lui qui a invent\u00e9 la science des nombres, le calcul, la g\u00e9om\u00e9trie, l\u2019astronomie, le trictrac, les d\u00e9s et enfin l\u2019\u00e9criture. Notez que l\u2019\u00e9criture vient en dernier et qu\u2019elle vient apr\u00e8s le jeu. Le roi Thamos r\u00e9gnait sur toute la contr\u00e9e et si\u00e9geait \u00e0 Th\u00e8bes. Theuth vient donc trouver ce roi pour lui montrer les arts qu\u2019il avait invent\u00e9s et lui dit qu\u2019il fallait les r\u00e9pandre parmi les \u00c9gyptiens. Le roi lui demande de quelle utilit\u00e9 est chacun de ces arts. Le dieu le renseigne et selon qu\u2019il les juge \u00eatre un bien ou un mal, le roi approuve ou bl\u00e2me. Mais quand on en vient \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9criture, Theuth d\u00e9clare : \u00ab Cette science rendra les \u00c9gyptiens plus savants et facilitera l\u2019art de se souvenir, car j\u2019ai trouv\u00e9 un rem\u00e8de pour soulager la science et la m\u00e9moire. \u00bb Le roi lui fait une r\u00e9ponse tr\u00e8s int\u00e9ressante en lui expliquant que tel est capable de cr\u00e9er des arts mais que tel autre est \u00e0 m\u00eame de juger de leur utilit\u00e9 ou de leur nocivit\u00e9, et il ajoute \u00e0 propos de l\u2019\u00e9criture : \u00ab Elle ne peut produire dans les \u00e2mes, en effet, que l\u2019oubli de ce qu\u2019elles savent en leur faisant n\u00e9gliger la m\u00e9moire. Parce qu\u2019ils auront foi dans l\u2019\u00e9criture, c\u2019est par le dehors, par des empreintes \u00e9trang\u00e8res, et non plus du dedans et du fond d\u2019eux-m\u00eames, que les hommes chercheront \u00e0 se ressouvenir. Tu as trouv\u00e9 le moyen, non point d\u2019enrichir la m\u00e9moire, mais de conserver les souvenirs qu\u2019elle a. Tu donnes \u00e0 tes disciples la pr\u00e9somption qu\u2019ils ont la science, non la science elle-m\u00eame. Quand ils auront, en effet, beaucoup appris sans ma\u00eetre, ils s\u2019imagineront devenus tr\u00e8s savants, et ils ne seront pour la plupart que des ignorants de commerce incommode, des savants imaginaires au lieu de vrais savants. \u00bb Remplacez l\u2019\u00e9criture par le num\u00e9rique et l\u2019on verra combien cette discussion entre un dieu et un roi est d\u2019actualit\u00e9. Cette m\u00e9fiance que Socrate reprend \u00e0 son compte \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard du discours \u00e9crit est la m\u00eame que certains peuvent \u00e9prouver \u00e0 propos du num\u00e9rique. Cette m\u00e9fiance n\u2019est pas l\u2019apanage du seul corps enseignant, mais il est assez curieux de noter que l\u2019\u00e9cole est devenue le royaume de l\u2019\u00e9crit et donc d\u2019une technique (car c\u2019est une technique) pour laquelle les Anciens n\u2019avaient que r\u00e9pulsion. Cela devrait au moins nous inciter \u00e0 davantage d\u2019indulgence pour ces nouveaut\u00e9s que des d\u00e9bats antiques nous conduisent \u00e0 relativiser. Pourtant la technique est entr\u00e9e dans les \u00e9tablissements scolaires depuis belle lurette. De l\u2019apparition du tableau noir \u00e0 celle du TBI, du papier carbone au photocopieur en passant par la machine \u00e0 polycopier \u00e0 alcool, l\u2019\u00e9cole a toujours accueilli de nouvelles techniques. Hier, le magn\u00e9tophone, le magn\u00e9toscope, puis la t\u00e9l\u00e9vision, aujourd\u2019hui, l\u2019ordinateur, puis la tablette. En un sens, l\u2019enseignant a toujours \u00e9t\u00e9 un technophile (mais il ne le sait pas toujours). C\u2019est un paradoxe qu\u2019il faut prendre en compte : m\u00eame lorsqu\u2019il est contre, un enseignant travaille forc\u00e9ment avec la technique. Parfois m\u00eame, la loi l\u2019y oblige comme c\u2019est le cas avec le cahier de textes num\u00e9rique que l\u2019enseignant a l\u2019obligation de remplir. Mais ce qu\u2019on ne peut manquer de constater, c\u2019est que la technique a envahi l\u2019univers professoral. Si l\u2019enseignant n\u2019a pas un ordinateur ou un vid\u00e9oprojecteur, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 une fois dans sa vie amen\u00e9 \u00e0 utiliser un r\u00e9troprojecteur ou un photocopieur voire son propre ordinateur dans son propre domicile.

Le journaliste demandant si les enfants de Jobs aimaient l\u2019iPad, Jobs r\u00e9pondait qu\u2019ils ne l\u2019avaient pas utilis\u00e9 et ajoutait : \u00ab Nous limitons l\u2019utilisation de la technologie par les enfants \u00e0 la maison \u00bb. Le CEO d\u2019Apple tenait ces propos en 2010 et il faut bien reconna\u00eetre qu\u2019\u00e0 cette \u00e9poque, mes enfants non plus n\u2019avaient jamais utilis\u00e9 d\u2019iPad\u2026 Et Jobs disait \u00ab nous limitons \u00bb, pas \u00bb nous interdisons \u00bb... Le journaliste Nick Bilton voulut en savoir davantage et alla se renseigner aupr\u00e8s d\u2019autres dirigeants de la Silicon Valley. Ainsi, l\u2019ancien r\u00e9dacteur en chef du magazine Wired et directeur de 3D Robotics affirmait conna\u00eetre les risques de la technologie et ne pas vouloir exposer ses enfants. Et l\u2019homme d\u2019\u00e9voquer la triade traditionnelle de la pornographie, du harc\u00e8lement et de l\u2019addiction. Un autre article du NewYork Times citait ces propos d\u2019un employ\u00e9 de Google : \u00ab Nous rendons la technologie aussi facile \u00e0 utiliser que l\u2019on peut \u00bb (l\u2019expression \u00ab as brain-dead easy to use \u00bb est difficile \u00e0 rendre). Et il ajoute : \u00ab Il n\u2019y a pas de raison que les enfants n\u2019y parviennent pas quand ils seront plus grands \u00bb\u2026 En lisant ces lignes, je ne peux pas m\u2019emp\u00eacher de penser encore \u00e0 Socrate citant les propos de Thamos : \u00ab tel est capable de cr\u00e9er des arts mais [\u2026] tel autre est \u00e0 m\u00eame de juger de leur utilit\u00e9 ou de leur nocivit\u00e9 \u00bb. Il faut croire que du c\u00f4t\u00e9 de la Californie, on ne d\u00e9roge pas \u00e0 la r\u00e8gle. Comment peut-on \u00e0 ce point \u00eatre aveugle et voir ses propres enfants comme des futurs consommateurs de Google \u00ab as brain-dead easy to use \u00bb ? Un de ces parents (mais nous \u00e9tions en 2014) pr\u00f4nait m\u00eame l\u2019usage de Snapchat, car il lui semblait qu\u2019un tel r\u00e9seau social ne garderait pas ind\u00e9finiment des donn\u00e9es qui survivraient des ann\u00e9es durant et pourraient \u00e9ventuellement vous embarrasser plus tard. Las ! On voit l\u00e0 qu\u2019on peut commettre de graves erreurs de jugement y compris quand on est de la partie\u2026 Heureusement, il n\u2019est que de revenir au premier article pour s\u2019apercevoir que tous les parents millionnaires de la high-tech ne sont pas si obtus et se contentent d\u2019\u00e9tablir des r\u00e8gles qui ne me choquent aucunement. Par exemple, les \u00e9crans sont bannis de la chambre. Ou encore on distingue le temps pass\u00e9 \u00e0 consommer de l\u2019\u00e9cran (regarder YouTube ou jouer \u00e0 des jeux vid\u00e9o) et cr\u00e9er du contenu (faire du montage vid\u00e9o, apprendre \u00e0 programmer). L\u2019ancien CEO de Twitter reconnaissait m\u00eame que l\u2019interdiction \u00e0 tout va serait contre-productive et se demandait quelle serait l\u2019attitude de ses enfants plus tard d\u00e9couvrant la technologie. C\u2019est le moins que l\u2019on puisse se demander quand on se pose la question de l\u2019\u00e9ducation de ses enfants et qu'on ne souhaite pas les maintenir dans un monde qui n\u2019existe pas. \u00c0 ce propos, les \u00e9coles Waldorf dans lesquelles certains de ces dirigeants mettent leurs enfants ne sauraient \u00eatre tenues pour des mod\u00e8les par ceux qui en France d\u00e9clarent que le num\u00e9rique est nocif, \u00e0 moins qu\u2019ils admettent que labourer un champ ou tricoter des chaussettes constitue une n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 scolaire \u00e0 19 000 euros l\u2019ann\u00e9e. Et l\u2019attirance pour le style r\u00e9tro d\u2019une vie simple avec des \u00e9tag\u00e8res en bois, un tableau noir et des craies, des stylos (notez que tout cela n\u2019est pas bien loin de ce qui caract\u00e9rise la plupart de nos \u00e9coles) n\u2019est que l\u2019effet d\u2019une nostalgie d\u2019un monde qui a la douceur d\u2019antan.

Probablement cette croyance s\u2019origine-t-elle dans les pratiques de ceux qui la consid\u00e8rent comme telle, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire comme un gadget. Et, de fait, nombreux sont les usages qui en rel\u00e8vent. Beaucoup de gens ont une utilisation somme toute assez superficielle de leur machine et pensent, \u00e0 tort, qu\u2019il ne saurait en aller autrement. Cependant, Binbin Zheng et ses coll\u00e8gues de l'universit\u00e9 du Michigan ont pass\u00e9 en revue une centaine d'\u00e9tudes produites depuis 2001 et, bien que seulement une dizaine d'entre elles seulement ait la rigueur scientifique requise, l'universitaire affirme : \u00ab I believe this technology, if implemented correctly, is worth the cost and effort because it lifts student achievement, enhances engagement and enthusiasm among students, improves teacher-student relationships and promotes 21st century skills such as technological proficiency and problem solving \u00bb. Le conseil d\u00e9partemental des Landes attribue un ordinateur \u00e0 tous les coll\u00e9giens depuis 2001 et, selon un rapport de l'inspection g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, c'est une op\u00e9ration qui semble, m\u00eame si tout n'est pas parfait, plut\u00f4t r\u00e9ussie : \u00ab L\u2019op\u00e9ration \u00ab Un coll\u00e9gien, un ordinateur portable \u00bb est ind\u00e9niablement une r\u00e9ussite. Install\u00e9e dans la dur\u00e9e par le conseil g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, elle donne aujourd\u2019hui des r\u00e9sultats en termes de densit\u00e9 d\u2019usages qui ne sont atteints dans aucun autre d\u00e9partement en France. La mission d\u2019inspection g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a certes constat\u00e9 des niveaux d\u2019usage tr\u00e8s vari\u00e9s d\u2019un coll\u00e8ge \u00e0 l\u2019autre, mais, globalement, l\u2019image qui ressort est tr\u00e8s positive. Les ordinateurs portables des \u00e9l\u00e8ves sont non seulement utilis\u00e9s en classe, mais ils servent aussi pour le travail \u00e0 la maison, les professeurs n\u2019h\u00e9sitant \u00e0 prescrire des t\u00e2ches sur cet outil. Toutes les disciplines sont concern\u00e9es, mais \u00e0 des degr\u00e9s divers. La structuration de l\u2019ordinateur avec une partie coll\u00e8ge et une partie maison aide \u00e0 comprendre que l\u2019ordinateur ne sert pas qu\u2019\u00e0 jouer et qu\u2019il a des fonctions polyvalentes. \u00bb Il faut cependant reconna\u00eetre que bien souvent les enfants donnent raison \u00e0 ces adultes qui voient d\u2019un mauvais \u0153il l\u2019introduction du num\u00e9rique. Nombre de ces enfants ne l\u2019utilisent que pour jouer ou pour se prendre en photo sous toutes les facettes avec Snapchat. Si vous \u00eates horrifi\u00e9 par l'utilisation qu'en font vos enfants, je vous propose de justifier l'utilisation qu'ils font de leur portable. Ils devront dans la semaine avoir rempli au moins une de ces t\u00e2ches. Dans le cas contraire, et selon la gravit\u00e9, vous pouvez au choix supprimer le t\u00e9l\u00e9phone ou couper le wifi (ou r\u00e9guler son utilisation directement dans votre box). Les enfants devront donc avoir r\u00e9alis\u00e9 au moins un des dix points suivants : Avoir lu au moins deux articles (et avoir gard\u00e9 des notes et la m\u00e9moire du contenu), Avoir regard\u00e9 un tutoriel (ce peut \u00eatre une recette de cuisine) et \u00e9ventuellement \u00eatre capable de reproduire ce dont il est question, Avoir not\u00e9 plusieurs paroles de chansons (dans une langue \u00e9trang\u00e8re) et not\u00e9 quelques mots de vocabulaire, Avoir \u00e9cout\u00e9 un podcast (de France Inter ou France Culture, par exemple) et pouvoir en discuter, Avoir lu un livre (sur Gallica, iBooks, Kindle...) et pouvoir en parler \u00e9videmment et partager ses notes sur les r\u00e9seaux sociaux, Avoir planifi\u00e9 un trajet (avec Keynote ou PowerPoint) en indiquant une br\u00e8ve histoire de la destination, les points \u00e0 visiter en s'appuyant sur des cartes et des images (en en donnant les sources), Avoir post\u00e9 et comment\u00e9 plusieurs photos (originales/insolites/amusantes...) sur Instagram, Avoir inscrit dans un calendrier ou l'app Rappels les dates des rendez-vous et t\u00e2ches \u00e0 accomplir, Avoir produit une ou plusieurs vid\u00e9os (souvenirs de voyage, d'un week-end\u2026), Avoir r\u00e9dig\u00e9 son journal (intime/extime) avec une app comme One Day (un journal \u00ab extime \u00bb \u00e9vite des informations trop personnelles ou intimes), Avoir suivi une le\u00e7on d'apprentissage du code avec une app d\u00e9di\u00e9e. Bref, de 1999 \u00e0 aujourd\u2019hui, on trouve de nombreuses raisons qui expliquent le d\u00e9samour professoral pour le num\u00e9rique. Mais o\u00f9 en est-on aujourd\u2019hui ? Les choses ont d\u00e9j\u00e0 un peu chang\u00e9. La volont\u00e9 politique y est pour quelque chose. Encore qu\u2019elle a quelque retard sur l\u2019\u00e9nergie de certains enseignants. Voyons ce qu\u2019il en est.","title":"Un gadget"},{"location":"%C3%89criture/Un%20Centaure%20%C3%A0%20l%27%C3%A9cole/Transformer%20l%E2%80%99%C3%A9cole/","text":"\u00c0 bien des \u00e9gards, la technologie ne fait qu\u2019amplifier des dispositifs que l\u2019on avait d\u00e9j\u00e0. Ainsi, quand ma femme me demande quel temps il va faire ou que je lui demande comment s\u2019appelle cet acteur, on ne fait que se googler l\u2019un l\u2019autre. Comme le rappelle Pierre L\u00e9vy, on n'est pas intelligent tout seul. On est intelligent parce qu'on a eu une \u00e9ducation, parce qu'on parle une langue. On n'est pas intelligent individuellement. Pour le philosophe, \u00ab Les processus cognitifs humains ont une base biologique qui ne change absolument pas mais qui sont techniquement augment\u00e9s \u00bb. L'\u00e9criture, les livres, l'imprimerie et maintenant la technologie ont tous constitu\u00e9 une \u00ab augmentation cognitive \u00bb. On augmente l'intelligence, une intelligence qui existait d\u00e9j\u00e0 puisque ce qu'on appelle l'intelligence collective, \u00e7a s'appelle la culture. En somme, on a toujours \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pendant de quelque chose ou de quelqu\u2019un et internet n\u2019est que l\u2019ultime avatar de cette d\u00e9pendance, comme le livre a \u00e9t\u00e9 une technique pour pallier les d\u00e9fauts de notre m\u00e9moire ou acc\u00e9l\u00e9rer la diffusion de ce qui y \u00e9tait consign\u00e9. L\u2019homme a toujours \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pendant. N\u2019\u00e9tant pas arm\u00e9 de naissance, \u00e9tant nu \u00e0 la naissance (nul croc ni fourrure pour se prot\u00e9ger), \u00e9tant donc faible, il n\u2019a pu compter que sur son intelligence et la technique. L\u2019histoire de l\u2019homme et de la technique est donc une histoire qui compte d\u00e9j\u00e0 plusieurs milliers d\u2019ann\u00e9es et le num\u00e9rique s\u2019inscrit dans cette d\u00e9sormais vieille histoire. Aussi je ne crois pas que le num\u00e9rique soit une injonction \u00e0 tout reprendre, \u00e0 tout changer. Faut-il, par exemple, adopter le mod\u00e8le SAMR et red\u00e9finir l\u2019\u00e9cole, lui assigner des objectifs nouveaux que seule la technologie \u00e9tait en mesure de faire \u00e9merger ? Je ne le crois pas vraiment. Je pense m\u00eame que ce serait contreproductif. Ce qui m\u2019int\u00e9resse ici, c\u2019est de voir comment ce que l\u2019on fait depuis des centaines d\u2019ann\u00e9es peut \u00eatre enrichi par le num\u00e9rique. Emmanuel Davidenkoff ne dit pas autre chose : \u00ab Certaines de ces innovations prendront d'autant plus vite qu'elles ne font qu'actualiser et r\u00e9interpr\u00e9ter des modalit\u00e9s d'enseignement ou d'apprentissage parfois mill\u00e9naires : H\u00e9rodote et \u00c9rasme pratiquaient la learning exp\u00e9dition ; un directeur de conscience n'a pas grand-chose \u00e0 envier \u00e0 un coach ; le serio ludere du Quattrocento italien pr\u00e9figure les serious games du XXIe si\u00e8cle ; C\u00e9lestin Freinet n'avait pas besoin de Twitter pour faire correspondre les \u00e9l\u00e8ves ; la flipped classroom (classe invers\u00e9e) avec son \u00ab professeur-pr\u00e9cepteur \u00bb n'est pas tr\u00e8s \u00e9loign\u00e9e du fonctionnement du lyc\u00e9e du XIXe si\u00e8cle... Les termes ont chang\u00e9, pas les grands ressorts de la p\u00e9dagogie. \u00bb En somme, il ne s\u2019agit pas tant de transformer l\u2019\u00e9cole que de la faire \u00e9voluer. La correction des copies est un bon exemple de cette \u00e9volution qu\u2019on peut qualifier d\u2019augmentation et qui est tr\u00e8s simple \u00e0 concevoir. Autant le dire tout de suite, les copies ont toujours \u00e9t\u00e9 une corv\u00e9e. Il y a de nombreuses raisons \u00e0 cela dont une au moins psychologique : la correction des copies est le moment o\u00f9 l\u2019enseignant mesure le fruit de son travail (et de celui de ses \u00e9l\u00e8ves) et cela peut parfois \u00eatre quelque peu d\u00e9courageant. Mais il y a aussi autre chose. Depuis que je tends vers le z\u00e9ro papier, la copie sur papier reste une sorte d\u2019anachronisme dans ma vie num\u00e9rique. Avec les ch\u00e8ques que je signe de plus en plus rarement, la copie est bien le seul endroit sur lequel j\u2019inflige \u00e0 quelqu\u2019un ma disgracieuse graphie. Et il y a pire. Honn\u00eatement, je pense que la copie est pr\u00e9vue pour que l\u2019\u00e9l\u00e8ve \u00e9crive dessus, mais certainement pas pour que l\u2019enseignant y ajoute sa correction. Il y a certes une marge (et encore est-elle encombr\u00e9e de petits trous), mais elle offre peu d\u2019espace. Il ne reste alors que le fameux cartouche, maigre emplacement dans lequel personne n\u2019a envie d\u2019\u00e9taler sa prose, si tant est que l\u2019\u00e9l\u00e8ve ait pens\u00e9 \u00e0 r\u00e9aliser ce petit espace destin\u00e9 \u00e0 la correction. Reste aussi la fin de la copie si l\u2019on veut se montrer un peu plus disert, s'il reste un peu de place. Heureusement, le num\u00e9rique apporte une solution \u00e0 mes \u00e9tats d\u2019\u00e2me. Si vos \u00e9l\u00e8ves n\u2019ont ni tablette ni ordinateur, vous pouvez faire comme Fran\u00e7ois Jourde, scanner les copies et faire une correction num\u00e9rique (je vous assure que c\u2019est tr\u00e8s simple encore que peut-\u00eatre un peu long). Sinon, si vos \u00e9l\u00e8ves sont \u00e9quip\u00e9s, voici ce qu\u2019il est possible de faire. L\u2019id\u00e9e est d\u2019avoir des copies au format PDF. Il existe de nombreuses applications qui vous permettent de faire des choses qu\u2019on ne soup\u00e7onne pas faisables avec un banal PDF. Et pourtant ! Avec PDF Expert, j\u2019annote les copies de plusieurs mani\u00e8res. Par exemple, j\u2019use et j\u2019abuse des tampons. Ce sont de petits rectangles que l\u2019on peut cr\u00e9er soi-m\u00eame et ensuite ins\u00e9rer sur la copie. J\u2019ai ainsi cr\u00e9\u00e9 diff\u00e9rents tampons, pour corriger des r\u00e9dactions : \u00ab \u00c0 reformuler \u00bb, \u00ab Ponctuation \u00bb, \u00ab Temps \u00bb, \u00ab R\u00e9p\u00e9tition \u00bb, etc. Ces tampons s\u2019ins\u00e8rent dans la marge, sont ais\u00e9ment reconnaissables \u00e0 leur couleur et font gagner un temps pr\u00e9cieux. Inutile de recopier dix fois de suite \u00ab Ponctuation \u00bb dans la marge. Parfois, ces br\u00e8ves remarques sont insuffisantes. Je recours alors \u00e0 la \u00ab note \u00bb. Comparable \u00e0 un petit post-it, cette note est cliquable et s\u2019ouvre pour faire appara\u00eetre une explication qui n\u2019aurait pas trouv\u00e9 de place dans la marge. On peut donc facilement ins\u00e9rer des explications suppl\u00e9mentaires qui elles aussi peuvent ensuite \u00eatre copi\u00e9es puis coll\u00e9es dans d\u2019autres copies. Je recours \u00e9galement \u00e0 tout un ensemble de codes de couleur afin de souligner les passages erron\u00e9s : le bleu pour la ponctuation ou les espaces en trop ou manquantes ; le rouge pour l\u2019orthographe ; le violet pour les temps verbaux ; le jaune pour les passages qui leur valent un des tampons susmentionn\u00e9s\u2026 Mais ce que je pr\u00e9f\u00e8re, c\u2019est tout de m\u00eame la remarque audio. On l\u2019a dit au d\u00e9but, sur papier, on manque souvent de place et on ne peut formuler clairement une appr\u00e9ciation d\u00e9taill\u00e9e. En enregistrant son appr\u00e9ciation, on peut vraiment d\u00e9velopper et expliciter les points \u00e0 retravailler. On \u00e9vite ainsi les remarques un peu s\u00e8ches ou courtes et on peut se montrer un peu r\u00e9confortant ou au contraire faire entendre sa d\u00e9ception. Et ensuite ? Ensuite, vous rendez la copie \u00e0 votre \u00e9l\u00e8ve. Pour ma part, j\u2019utilise Evernote mais vous pouvez tout aussi bien utiliser d\u2019autres applications qui servent \u00e0 de nombreux enseignants de v\u00e9ritables cahiers num\u00e9riques. Et l\u2019on voit qu\u2019avec PDF Expert (mais on peut aussi utiliser d\u2019autres applications), la copie aussi devient num\u00e9rique, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire r\u00e9ellement num\u00e9rique : elle est augment\u00e9e. Il y a une r\u00e9elle plus-value \u00e0 ce que la copie soit num\u00e9rique. Avec le temps, je prends conscience de ceci : avec des copies num\u00e9riques, l\u2019enseignant garde une trace de la copie. Auparavant, je \u00ab remettais \u00bb les copies. Litt\u00e9ralement, je les rendais et ne les poss\u00e9dais plus, ce qui m\u2019embarrassait parfois, notamment en conseil de classe ou lors d\u2019une r\u00e9union parents/professeurs, car je ne me souvenais pas pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment des erreurs faites par tel ou tel \u00e9l\u00e8ve. \u00c0 pr\u00e9sent, je peux affiner mes remarques trimestrielles apr\u00e8s m\u2019\u00eatre rafraichi la m\u00e9moire en me replongeant dans le travail de l\u2019\u00e9l\u00e8ve. Je remarque aussi que, lorsque le travail a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait en groupe, on peut distribuer un exemplaire de la copie \u00e0 chacun des \u00e9l\u00e8ves. Voil\u00e0 donc un exemple de ce que le num\u00e9rique permet non pas en termes de red\u00e9finition mais d\u2019augmentation. Il en va de m\u00eame de la lecture et des manuels scolaires. Pour ma part, longtemps, mon horizon num\u00e9rique a eu pour borne la litt\u00e9rature puisque l\u2019acc\u00e8s \u00e0 celle-ci \u00e9tait toujours rel\u00e9gu\u00e9 au seul papier. Mais pour tout dire, je n\u2019aimais pas lire sur l\u2019\u00e9cran de mon iPad. Le r\u00e9tro\u00e9clairage \u00e9tait le coupable. Cependant, j\u2019\u00e9tais assez fascin\u00e9 par les possibilit\u00e9s induites par le livre num\u00e9rique. La premi\u00e8re chose qui m\u2019a plu (c\u2019\u00e9tait sur iBooks) \u00e9tait de pouvoir surligner le livre sans avoir \u00e0 \u00e9prouver une once de culpabilit\u00e9 \u00e0 ainsi barbouiller l\u2019ouvrage puisque je pouvais ensuite tout effacer. La multiplicit\u00e9 des couleurs offre une option int\u00e9ressante d\u2019exploitation en classe, une fois l\u2019iPad branch\u00e9 sur un vid\u00e9oprojecteur. Plus personnelle est la possibilit\u00e9 de prendre des notes dans la marge. Annoter un livre (de m\u00eame que mettre un marque-page) n\u2019est donc pas l\u2019apanage du papier. L\u00e0 aussi, je trouve qu\u2019une exploitation scolaire de la note pourrait \u00eatre envisag\u00e9e : l\u2019\u00e9l\u00e8ve peut r\u00e9pondre aux questions du manuel directement sur le livre. Il peut m\u00eame envoyer ses r\u00e9ponses \u00e0 l\u2019enseignant. Les fonctions de partage permettent \u00e9galement de diffuser \u00e0 tout-va puisque l\u2019on peut, par exemple, tweeter un passage qui vous a s\u00e9duit. J\u2019ai aim\u00e9 annoter, souligner, surligner ou afficher mes livres en classe, mais le dictionnaire int\u00e9gr\u00e9 m\u2019a \u00e9poustoufl\u00e9. Et n\u2019\u00e9tait-ce la limitation aux dictionnaires int\u00e9gr\u00e9s au syst\u00e8me, cet acc\u00e8s tient du g\u00e9nie. A-t-on jamais d\u00e9plor\u00e9 d\u2019avoir \u00e0 quitter l\u2019ouvrage lu pour chercher un mot dans le dictionnaire ? Ici, tapoter sur un mot fait appara\u00eetre une sorte de petit pop-up contenant le sens du mot. Une int\u00e9gration du Robert, d\u2019Antidote ou du TLFi me comblerait de bonheur. Ce qui est amusant, c\u2019est que le dictionnaire s\u2019adapte \u00e0 chaque langue. Vous lisez en Anglais ? Le dictionnaire sera anglais. Vous lisez en Allemand ? Le dictionnaire sera allemand. Et la m\u00eame chose en Grec, Italien, Japonais, etc. Je n\u2019ai jamais autant lu en Anglais et je suis persuad\u00e9 que je ne l\u2019aurais jamais fait sans le num\u00e9rique. J\u2019utilise aussi la fonctionnalit\u00e9 du dictionnaire int\u00e9gr\u00e9 pour chercher un peu tout et n\u2019importe quoi, en tout cas quelque chose qui ne sera pas dans le dictionnaire. En ce cas, notre petit pop-up proposera de \u00ab Rechercher sur le web \u00bb et j\u2019acc\u00e8derai \u00e0 une requ\u00eate Google d\u00e9j\u00e0 toute pr\u00eate. La fonction Prononcer en impose. Sur un iPhone ou un iPad, elle doit tout d\u2019abord \u00eatre activ\u00e9e dans les R\u00e9glages (> G\u00e9n\u00e9ral > Accessibilit\u00e9 > Parole > \u00c9noncer la s\u00e9lection). Elle permet de faire lire le texte \u00e0 voix haute par le syst\u00e8me. C\u2019est une fonction qui s\u2019adresse aux personnes dont la vue ne permet pas de bien lire le texte m\u00eame en agrandissant la police (possibilit\u00e9 que je n\u2019ai pas m\u00eame \u00e9voqu\u00e9e tant nous y sommes dor\u00e9navant accoutum\u00e9s). \u00c9videmment nous pouvons avoir des \u00e9l\u00e8ves qui ont ce handicap. On peut \u00eatre confront\u00e9 aussi \u00e0 des \u00e9l\u00e8ves rencontrant des difficult\u00e9s de lecture et qui suivront d\u2019autant mieux la lecture que les mots automatiquement lus sont \u00e9galement surlign\u00e9s. Mais je recours moi-m\u00eame \u00e0 cette fonction d\u00e8s lors que je lis un texte en anglais et que je veux m\u2019assurer de la prononciation de tel ou tel mot. De plus, il est vraiment amusant de constater qu\u2019un livre devient litt\u00e9ralement \u00ab audible \u00bb. Bien s\u00fbr, cela n\u2019a rien \u00e0 voir avec l\u2019audiobook ; \u00e7a n\u2019a rien de commun avec les beaux enregistrements que de bons lecteurs, acteurs et m\u00eame auteurs ont fait de tel ou tel chef-d\u2019\u0153uvre, mais disons que \u00e7a d\u00e9panne. Une autre application comme Voice Dream Reader lit \u00e9galement vos textes (PDF, ePub) et vous permet m\u00eame d\u2019aller en rechercher sur Gutenberg. Ce n\u2019est pas une application de lecture de livres audios. Cela correspond plut\u00f4t \u00e0 la fonction Prononcer \u00e9voqu\u00e9e ci-dessus, ce qu\u2019on appelle aussi plus souvent, en Anglais, text-to-speech. \u00c0 ceci pr\u00e8s qu\u2019un large choix de voix vous est propos\u00e9 (enfin vendu). On peut donc obtenir quelques voix (mais surtout en Anglais) moins \u00ab robotiques \u00bb que celle int\u00e9gr\u00e9e \u00e0 iOS. Cette application prend tout son sens dans le domaine de l\u2019\u00e9ducation puisqu\u2019un \u00e9l\u00e8ve peut suivre la lecture (les mots sont surlign\u00e9s) mais, en plus, il dispose de polices comme Dyslexie ou OpenDyslexic. Cependant, on peut l\u2019utiliser dans certains cas bien pr\u00e9cis : faire lire le livre qui vous passionne dans la voiture (avec un iPhone branch\u00e9 sur l\u2019autoradio par exemple) ou encore pour \u00ab faciliter \u00bb la lecture. En effet, un ami me confiait r\u00e9cemment qu\u2019il utilisait la fonction text-to-speech parce qu\u2019il avait tendance, au cours d\u2019une lecture \u00ab normale \u00bb, \u00e0 vagabonder dans ses pens\u00e9es et \u00e0 perdre le fil (vous savez quand vous continuez \u00e0 lire mais que quelques lignes ou pages plus loin, vous vous apercevez que vous n\u2019avez rien retenu). Au moins, avec une telle fonction, cet ami me disait retenir quelque chose m\u00eame quand son imagination battait la campagne. Son esprit gardait toujours une trace non pas du texte lu, mais du texte entendu. Les fonctions de recherche m\u2019ont litt\u00e9ralement transport\u00e9 de bonheur quand je les ai d\u00e9couvertes. Un peu comme le crtl / cmd + f dans une page web ou un document long comme le bras. S\u00e9lectionnez un mot, tapotez sur Rechercher et vous avez toutes les occurrences du mot dans le livre. C\u2019est magique ! En fait, j\u2019utilise le plus souvent cette fonction en tapotant sur la loupe en haut \u00e0 droite. Essayez et voyez comme il est ais\u00e9 de retrouver un passage qui vous int\u00e9ressait et dont vous aviez oubli\u00e9 l\u2019emplacement ! Auparavant, je cherchais fr\u00e9n\u00e9tiquement le passage d\u00e9sir\u00e9 et j\u2019en ressortais parfois bredouille. Ce temps-l\u00e0 est r\u00e9volu. Voil\u00e0 donc un tour d\u2019horizon des possibilit\u00e9s du livre num\u00e9rique sur une tablette ou sur un t\u00e9l\u00e9phone voire un ordinateur. Mais c\u2019est avec la liseuse que je suis devenu un vrai lecteur num\u00e9rique. Moi qui croyais que la liseuse \u00e9tait une anomalie dans un march\u00e9 largement occup\u00e9 par les tablettes ! Un appareil un peu surann\u00e9 dont le premier mod\u00e8le \u00e9tait apparu\u2026 en 2007 ! Je la voyais comme une tablette amput\u00e9e de nombreuses fonctions et je ne voyais pas que ce petit appareil l\u00e9ger, relativement peu cher, permettait au lecteur de se concentrer sur le seul texte (c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire sans avoir \u00e0 \u00eatre interrompu par mille et une notifications) et ce sans se d\u00e9truire les yeux avec le r\u00e9tro\u00e9clairage un peu trop violent de certaines tablettes. Bien s\u00fbr, on retrouve sur la liseuse toutes (ou la plupart) des fonctionnalit\u00e9s susmentionn\u00e9es, mais il en est d\u2019autres que je suis toujours surpris de n\u2019avoir toujours pas trouv\u00e9 chez Apple. Par exemple, Word Wise. Cette option favorise l\u2019apprentissage de la langue dans laquelle vous lisez. Elle est certes perfectible, mais elle permet d\u2019afficher des d\u00e9finitions au-dessus des mots, en filigrane en somme. On peut m\u00eame enregistrer le vocabulaire recherch\u00e9 dans le dictionnaire. On se retrouve alors avec un nouveau livre contenant les mots ayant fait l\u2019objet d\u2019une recherche. C\u2019est tr\u00e8s pratique pour r\u00e9viser, une fois la lecture termin\u00e9e. Il m\u2019est arriv\u00e9 de constater que le lecteur que j\u2019\u00e9tais devenu ne lisait plus un livre \u00e0 la fois mais plusieurs. En fait, de nombreuses fois, il m\u2019est arriv\u00e9 d\u2019\u00eatre \u00e9tonn\u00e9 par un mot de l\u2019auteur ou de ressentir le besoin de v\u00e9rifier la validit\u00e9 d\u2019une information et je le faisais en utilisant le navigateur int\u00e9gr\u00e9. C\u2019est un acc\u00e8s \u00e0 Wikip\u00e9dia que nous avons ainsi et, comme le dictionnaire int\u00e9gr\u00e9, il permet d\u2019effectuer des recherches assez facilement et rapidement. On n\u2019ira pas surfer sur le web et s\u2019\u00e9loigner de sa lecture, le navigateur int\u00e9gr\u00e9 ne le permettant pas. On peut aussi acc\u00e9der aux passages les plus surlign\u00e9s par les autres lecteurs. Certains n\u2019aiment pas. Je trouve \u00e7a assez amusant. Ainsi, au cours de votre lecture, vous voyez que tel passage a \u00e9t\u00e9 soulign\u00e9 tant de fois. Il m\u2019est arriv\u00e9 de relire deux fois un passage que d\u2019autres avaient soulign\u00e9. Je n\u2019y avais tout d\u2019abord pas pr\u00eat\u00e9 attention puis, constatant que le passage avait \u00e9t\u00e9 soulign\u00e9, je me suis dit que peut-\u00eatre je n\u2019avais pas \u00e9t\u00e9 assez attentif. Et de reprendre le passage en question. Il y a encore d\u2019autres fonctionnalit\u00e9s. La fonction X-Ray est typiquement du type de celle qui aurait chang\u00e9 ma vie d\u2019\u00e9tudiant. Comme l\u2019indique Amazon : \u00ab La fonction X-Ray permet d\u2019explorer la structure d\u2019un livre sur le Kindle Touch, ses id\u00e9es essentielles, les personnages ou les th\u00e8mes. \u00bb Par exemple, cela vous permet d\u2019acc\u00e9der \u00e0 tous les emplacements o\u00f9 le personnage untel appara\u00eet. L\u2019ensemble des personnages peut alors \u00eatre affich\u00e9 par ordre alphab\u00e9tique mais aussi par ordre d\u2019apparition ou encore par ordre de pertinence. De m\u00eame avec les principaux th\u00e8mes du livre, ce qui facilite les r\u00e9visions en vue d\u2019un examen ou un concours. Malheureusement cette fonction ne se trouve pas dans tous les livres, et de surcro\u00eet elle ne se trouve que dans les livres \u00e9crits en anglais. Il y a d\u2019autres options que je n\u2019ai jamais essay\u00e9es comme Kindle FreeTime qui consiste \u00e0 cr\u00e9er un profil, \u00e0 ajouter des livres et cr\u00e9er des d\u00e9fis, des objectifs de lecture pour inciter les enfants \u00e0 lire. D\u2019autres que j\u2019utilise assez peu comme l\u2019option Send to Kindle. Mais - et je l\u2019ai compris relativement tardivement - la liseuse a pour elle encore tout un domaine invisible, si bien que cet avantage est g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement tout simplement ignor\u00e9 dans les d\u00e9bats livre papier vs livre num\u00e9rique. En g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, certaines personnes pensent avoir tout dit quand ils font observer que leur amour du papier l\u2019emporte sur l\u2019\u00e9cran dans son \u00e9crin de plastique bon march\u00e9. Or c\u2019est oublier que le texte sur une liseuse s\u2019enrichit de fonctions tangibles (je peux toucher le texte et effectuer certaines actions comme faire appara\u00eetre la d\u00e9finition du mot par exemple) mais il y a aussi tout ce qui vient se loger sur des serveurs (en l\u2019occurrence ceux d\u2019Amazon) et qui donne acc\u00e8s \u00e0 des ressources extraordinaires. Ainsi, en me rendant sur https://kindle.amazon.com, j\u2019acc\u00e8de \u00e0 deux fonctions dont j\u2019aurais aujourd\u2019hui beaucoup de mal \u00e0 me passer : Daily Review et Your highlights. La premi\u00e8re consiste \u00e0 vous rappeler une fois par jour les passages que vous avez soulign\u00e9s ou annot\u00e9s : \u00ab Daily Review is a tool to help you review and remember the most significant ideas from your books. It shows you flashcards with either your highlights and notes or the Popular Highlights from one of your books. [\u2026] The periodic review of ideas makes it easier to remember them. This works better if you space the reviews over increasing time intervals, a \"Spacing Effect\" that was first identified by German psychologist Hermann Ebbinghaus. Depending on how many books you have marked as \"read\", you will see a particular book again in the Daily Review in roughly 1 week, 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, and thereafter annually. You\u2019re not limited to reviewing only one book per day; at the bottom of the flashcard you can select \"Review another book\". \u00bb On voit l\u00e0 qu\u2019il s\u2019agit rien moins que de lutter contre l\u2019oubli. Quand vous lisez un livre, vous en retenez un certain nombre de choses la premi\u00e8re semaine, puis un mois apr\u00e8s certains d\u00e9tails s\u2019effacent. Trois mois apr\u00e8s, vous en avez retenu l\u2019essentiel, mais dans six mois, vous en avez oubli\u00e9 les trois quarts, surtout si vous \u00eates un grand lecteur (un clou chassant l\u2019autre). Daily Review est un moyen de pallier ce fort naturel probl\u00e8me. On peut au passage remercier notre m\u00e9moire de ne pas avoir \u00e0 tout retenir sinon nous serions comme ce personnage de Borges qui se souvient de tout et qui ne peut plus vivre, car chaque geste, chaque objet \u00e9veille tout un monde. Quand j\u2019\u00e9tais \u00e9tudiant, j\u2019avais un carnet dans lequel je notais les livres que j\u2019avais lus ainsi que les passages que j\u2019avais soulign\u00e9s. Tout cela est d\u00e9sormais fait automatiquement. On retrouve tous les passages surlign\u00e9s et annot\u00e9s. Mais je go\u00fbte assez la synchronisation de tous les appareils. Je commence un livre sur la Kindle laiss\u00e9e sur la table de nuit. Je peux reprendre dans la journ\u00e9e la lecture sur l\u2019app Kindle install\u00e9e sur mon iPhone, qui lui a le bon go\u00fbt de n\u2019avoir pas \u00e9t\u00e9 oubli\u00e9 sur ladite table de nuit. On voit l\u00e0 qu\u2019il y a autour de la liseuse tout un \u00e9cosyst\u00e8me qui favorise la lecture, stimule votre m\u00e9moire et augmente vos capacit\u00e9s de lecteur. Bien s\u00fbr, on ne peut ignorer qu\u2019il y aussi un int\u00e9r\u00eat mercantile, mais quel libraire n\u2019en a pas ? Le libraire d'aujourd'hui qui, selon les tenants du livre papier, manque tant \u00e0 Amazon est le r\u00e9seau social. L\u2019entreprise de Seattle a d\u2019ailleurs rachet\u00e9 Goodreads en 2013. Il est fr\u00e9quent d\u2019entendre dire que les algorithmes d\u2019Amazon ne remplaceront jamais les conseils du bon vieux libraire. C\u2019est probablement vrai. On reproche \u00e9galement aux algorithmes de ne nous faire trouver que ce que l\u2019on cherche, et ce n\u2019est pas enti\u00e8rement faux. Personnellement, je suis toujours entr\u00e9 dans une librairie en sachant ce que je cherchais. Quoi qu\u2019il en soit, r\u00e9duire le libraire virtuel \u00e0 une formule informatique est r\u00e9ducteur. C\u2019est oublier un peu vite le r\u00f4le des r\u00e9seaux sociaux et certains sont m\u00eame sp\u00e9cialis\u00e9s dans les livres. C\u2019est le cas de Goodreads qui permet de g\u00e9n\u00e9rer des catalogues de livres et donc de cr\u00e9er une v\u00e9ritable petite biblioth\u00e8que, des listes de livres que l\u2019on souhaite lire, de partager son avis ou ses annotations de livres lus et m\u00eame carr\u00e9ment de parcourir des bases de donn\u00e9es. On peut aussi \u00e9valuer ou voter pour tel ou tel livre, recevoir des newsletter, d\u00e9couvrir ce que lisent vos amis, etc. Mais disons-le tout de suite, le d\u00e9bat opposant le num\u00e9rique et le papier est infond\u00e9. En prenant le contre-pied de Victor Hugo, on peut dire que \u00ab Ceci ne tuera pas cela \u00bb. Internet n\u2019a pas tu\u00e9 la t\u00e9l\u00e9vision qui n\u2019a pas tu\u00e9 la radio qui n\u2019a pas tu\u00e9 la presse\u2026 Fort de l\u2019id\u00e9e qu\u2019une technique ne remplace pas une autre, j\u2019ai acquis la conviction que le livre tel qu\u2019on le conna\u00eet ne sera en rien menac\u00e9 par le num\u00e9rique. De ce point de vue, chaque fois que je mets les pieds dans un salon consacr\u00e9 \u00e0 la litt\u00e9rature (en particulier de jeunesse), je me conforte dans cette id\u00e9e. Le livre sur papier, joliment reli\u00e9, avec de belles illustrations ou non, a de beaux jours devant lui. Il n\u2019est que de constater le taux de fr\u00e9quentation de telles manifestations. D\u2019ailleurs, le march\u00e9 du livre en France est estim\u00e9 \u00e0 4 milliards d\u2019euros par an, devant le cin\u00e9ma et la musique. C\u2019est dire s\u2019il se porte bien. En revanche, je sais que, si la tablette ou la liseuse ne tueront pas les livres, ils tueront cependant un certain type de livre. C\u2019est peut-\u00eatre le cas du livre de poche, c\u2019est \u00e0 coup s\u00fbr celui du manuel scolaire. Cela pour une raison tr\u00e8s simple : si le manuel num\u00e9rique a mieux \u00e0 offrir que son jumeau de papier, alors l\u2019esp\u00e9rance de vie de ce dernier est menac\u00e9e. On le sait, le manuel est solidement implant\u00e9 dans la culture scolaire. Or le manuel tel qu\u2019on le conna\u00eet aujourd\u2019hui \u2013 celui-l\u00e0 m\u00eame dont le co\u00fbt est si \u00e9lev\u00e9 (et encore cette d\u00e9pense est-elle concurrenc\u00e9e par celle que provoque le nombre croissant des photocopies), ce manuel parfois superbement ignor\u00e9 par les enseignants somm\u00e9s de le choisir \u2013 finit in\u00e9luctablement au rebut. Ab\u00eem\u00e9, ne correspondant plus au programme, trop lourd aussi, il doit \u00eatre renouvel\u00e9, modifi\u00e9, all\u00e9g\u00e9. Sa dur\u00e9e de vie est de cinq ans environ, et les contraintes, qui ont pr\u00e9sid\u00e9 \u00e0 sa conception, nombreuses. En effet, l\u2019auteur d\u2019un manuel ne doit pas d\u00e9passer tant de pages voire tant de mots, il ob\u00e9it \u00e0 une ligne \u00e9ditoriale ou \u00e0 un programme, selon des d\u00e9lais parfois excessivement courts, etc. Enfin, ces manuels sont intrins\u00e8quement pens\u00e9s non pas tant pour les \u00e9l\u00e8ves que pour les enseignants auxquels on propose un ouvrage clef en main qui leur \u00e9pargnera nombre d\u2019efforts ainsi que des sc\u00e9narios p\u00e9dagogiques relativement convenus (si l'on excepte le cloclogate). Or ce sont pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment ces contraintes ou ces d\u00e9fauts qui volent en \u00e9clat d\u00e8s lors que le manuel devient num\u00e9rique. Il perd son poids. Il met \u00e0 mal les limites \u00e9ditoriales et ouvre des perspectives p\u00e9dagogiques o\u00f9 l\u2019audace est possible. De plus, devenu intangible, il n\u2019est plus \u00e0 jeter, il est mis \u00e0 jour. Il frappe d\u2019obsolescence ou d\u2019inanit\u00e9 la photocopie. Enfin, paradoxalement, il permet d\u2019envisager une r\u00e9duction des co\u00fbts. Mieux encore, tout se passe comme si le manuel devenant num\u00e9rique, tel un compos\u00e9 chimique, agissait comme un r\u00e9v\u00e9lateur, le r\u00e9v\u00e9lateur d\u2019une m\u00e9tamorphose scolaire. En effet, la publication du manuel num\u00e9rique pose un certain nombre de questions ou plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment remet en question un certain nombre de mod\u00e8les : un mod\u00e8le \u00e9conomique, mais aussi un mode d\u2019enseignement voire d\u2019enseignant tout court, tant il est vrai que ce r\u00f4le est plus que jamais \u00e0 red\u00e9finir. Le manuel num\u00e9rique \u2013 donc immat\u00e9riel \u2013 ne s\u2019ab\u00eeme jamais, il ne s\u2019\u00e9corne pas, il ne s\u2019efface pas. L\u2019\u00e9l\u00e8ve est m\u00eame, pour la premi\u00e8re fois, invit\u00e9 \u00e0 \u00e9crire, gribouiller, souligner, surligner, annoter son manuel. Ainsi, devenu num\u00e9rique, le manuel peut devenir possession des \u00e9l\u00e8ves. Personnalisable et mobile, l\u2019\u00e9l\u00e8ve peut se l\u2019approprier. Faire sien son manuel est une composante essentielle du processus d\u2019apprentissage. Tel le moine copiste \u00e9crivant dans la marge de son manuscrit ses r\u00e9flexions et corrections, l\u2019\u00e9l\u00e8ve peut annoter, corriger et augmenter son manuel num\u00e9rique. Qu\u2019il cherche \u00e0 faire cela avec son manuel papier et il aura \u00e0 rendre des comptes, et \u00e0 la documentaliste et au gestionnaire de l'\u00e9tablissement. \u00c9videmment d\u2019aucuns r\u00e9torqueront que si le manuel ne se d\u00e9t\u00e9riore pas, ce peut \u00eatre le cas de la machine qui le supporte. Force est cependant de constater que certaines tablettes ont une dur\u00e9e de vie largement suffisante pour accompagner les \u00e9l\u00e8ves dans leur scolarit\u00e9. Que je sache nombre d\u2019iPad 2 sont encore en circulation dans les coll\u00e8ges. Si l\u2019on veut ajouter quelque argument plus consensuel, pr\u00e9cisons que c\u2019est au motif de la sant\u00e9 publique qu\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 publi\u00e9e la circulaire n\u00b0 2008-002 du 11 janvier 2008 sur le poids du cartable. R\u00e9guli\u00e8rement, on voit maintes associations de parents ou de kin\u00e9sith\u00e9rapeutes se saisir du probl\u00e8me. Or cela ne doit-il pas rentrer dans le calcul ? Ne doit-on pas se demander quel est l\u2019impact sur la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 sociale. Un mod\u00e8le \u00e9conomique est donc \u00e0 red\u00e9finir. Loin de grever le budget, le financement du manuel num\u00e9rique et de son support peut se faire, on l'a vu plus haut, en utilisant l\u2019argent diff\u00e9remment. Mais, on le devine, c\u2019est aussi un mod\u00e8le p\u00e9dagogique que l\u2019on doit repenser. Si l\u2019on se demande pourquoi utiliser un manuel num\u00e9rique, il faut \u00e9videmment se demander ce qu\u2019il apporte au regard de son \u00e9quivalent de papier. On a vu qu\u2019il \u00e9tait plus l\u00e9ger, qu\u2019il permettait de s\u2019affranchir de certaines contraintes \u00e9ditoriales, qu\u2019il \u00e9tait plus ais\u00e9ment remis au go\u00fbt du jour, etc. Cependant ces changements ne servent \u00e0 rien, ou \u00e0 pas grand-chose, s'ils ne s\u2019accompagnent d\u2019un changement dans la fa\u00e7on d\u2019enseigner, dans la p\u00e9dagogie. Il faut se convaincre de cette id\u00e9e : une technique a une influence sur l\u2019enseignement. Ainsi, le passage de la plume d\u2019oie \u00e0 la plume de fer a permis d\u2019enseigner aux enfants l\u2019arithm\u00e9tique plus t\u00f4t, la dext\u00e9rit\u00e9 requise \u00e9tant moindre avec la plume de fer. On verra que le num\u00e9rique permet de modifier la p\u00e9dagogie, en la diff\u00e9renciant \u00e0 moindres frais (c\u2019est, par exemple, le cas de la dict\u00e9e r\u00e9alis\u00e9e sur un support num\u00e9rique comme le manuel). L'appropriation du support par l'\u00e9l\u00e8ve ou l'enrichissement du texte par le dictionnaire int\u00e9gr\u00e9, la multitude d'exercices apportant \u00e0 l'\u00e9l\u00e8ve un \u00ab feedback \u00bb, la possibilit\u00e9 d'interroger l'enseignant voire de partager une portion de texte pour demander de l'aide sur les r\u00e9seaux sociaux sont autant d'exemples qui plaident en faveur du manuel num\u00e9rique. La vari\u00e9t\u00e9 des supports qu'offre le manuel rend une notion encore abstraite dans l'esprit d'un \u00e9l\u00e8ve la d\u00e9couvrant davantage concr\u00e8te. Ainsi des figures g\u00e9om\u00e9triques en 3D. Mais c'est le cas des documents audio, des vid\u00e9os, des images interactives sur lesquelles on peut zoomer ou cliquer pour obtenir des informations suppl\u00e9mentaires. Les cartes heuristiques, les diaporamas riches en animation sont autant de moyens de rendre pr\u00e9hensible une notion. Le manuel num\u00e9rique permet donc d\u2019aider davantage les \u00e9l\u00e8ves, tous les \u00e9l\u00e8ves et peut-\u00eatre m\u00eame de faire que le coll\u00e8ge devienne enfin unique, car il ne l\u2019a jamais \u00e9t\u00e9, n\u2019en d\u00e9plaise \u00e0 ses d\u00e9tracteurs. Alors un r\u00f4le nouveau est d\u00e9volu \u00e0 l\u2019enseignant. On pourra penser qu\u2019il n\u2019est pas assez pay\u00e9, et l\u2019on n\u2019aura pas tort. On pourra penser que sa vie personnelle est envahie par sa vie professionnelle, et l\u2019on aura tort. Cela a toujours \u00e9t\u00e9 le cas, lorsque l\u2019on pr\u00e9pare ses cours ou lorsque l\u2019on corrige ses copies. Tout au plus, les choses s\u2019accentuent-elles davantage, mais ce r\u00f4le gagne en importance. En fait, apr\u00e8s avoir mis l\u2019\u00e9l\u00e8ve au centre du dispositif scolaire, l\u2019enseignant doit, \u00e0 son tour, trouver une place centrale, une place qu\u2019internet a fait \u00e9merger. J\u2019ai commenc\u00e9 par \u00e9voquer le co\u00fbt ph\u00e9nom\u00e9nal du manuel scolaire en France. C\u2019est un co\u00fbt qui p\u00e8se sur les collectivit\u00e9s un co\u00fbt que l\u2019on peut consid\u00e9rer, bien souvent, comme superf\u00e9tatoire. Ces manuels fort on\u00e9reux, d\u00e9laiss\u00e9s par les uns, port\u00e9s au pinacle par les autres, ne connaissent qu\u2019une utilisation partielle, une utilisation que ne justifie pas un tel co\u00fbt. Je ne crois pas conna\u00eetre un seul enseignant qui l\u2019utilise d\u2019un bout \u00e0 l\u2019autre, \u00e0 l\u2019exclusivit\u00e9 de toute autre ressource. La r\u00e9alit\u00e9 est que, parfois, l\u2019enseignant s\u2019appuie sur tel ou tel manuel, et recompose sa progression p\u00e9dagogique en glanant \u00e7\u00e0 et l\u00e0 diverses ressources. Ces ressources peuvent provenir des manuels qui envahissent nos casiers lors des renouvellements de programmes. Bien souvent ces ressources proviennent d\u2019internet. Que constate-t-on ? Que les enseignants b\u00e2tissent des sites internet dans lesquels ils proposent leurs propres ressources, que les enseignants r\u00e9fl\u00e9chissent \u00e0 leur pratique sur leur propre blog, \u00e9changent leurs id\u00e9es sur les r\u00e9seaux sociaux, dans de nombreux forums ou listes de discussion. Ces enseignants scannent, pr\u00eatent, transmettent, diffusent leurs travaux par ces divers truchements, en cons\u00e9quence de quoi internet regorge de documents qu\u2019au prix d\u2019une adaptation l\u2019enseignant fait siens. C\u2019est une gigantesque salle des professeurs de toutes les mati\u00e8res, de tous les niveaux, de toutes les nationalit\u00e9s (si la langue le permet). Depuis l\u2019av\u00e8nement des r\u00e9seaux sociaux, je n\u2019ai jamais autant c\u00f4toy\u00e9 mes homologues belges, qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois ou marocains. D\u2019aucuns, et les \u00e9diteurs en premi\u00e8re ligne, verront ces richesses \u00e0 travers le prisme de leur profession. Ils regretteront, par exemple, que l\u2019auteur et son autorit\u00e9 disparaisse, que l\u2019\u00e9diteur ne soit plus le garant d\u2019une ligne \u00e9ditoriale. On va jusqu\u2019\u00e0 toiser cet afflux num\u00e9rique, et filant la m\u00e9taphore aquatique, le qualifiant d\u2019\u00e9gout. Ces consid\u00e9rations font de l\u2019interm\u00e9diaire entre l\u2019\u0153uvre et le lecteur une n\u00e9cessit\u00e9. Or si elle n\u2019a pas toujours exist\u00e9, elle n\u2019est pas m\u00eame seulement n\u00e9cessaire ni souhaitable. Elle n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire en ceci qu\u2019un \u00e9diteur n\u2019est le garant de rien du tout. Le march\u00e9 de l\u2019\u00e9dition pr\u00e9sente des dizaines de \u00ab chefs-d\u2019\u0153uvre \u00bb \u00e0 lire chaque semaine. On voudrait nous faire croire \u00e0 la sup\u00e9riorit\u00e9 de ce flot sur celui du num\u00e9rique parce qu\u2019il a fait l\u2019objet d\u2019un tri, un tri parfois li\u00e9 \u00e0 des imp\u00e9ratifs mercantiles ? Que dire des vanity press, ces livres vendus \u00e0 compte d\u2019auteur ? des livres \u00e0 grand tirage d\u2019une m\u00e9diocrit\u00e9 absolument inconcevable ? Ont bien \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9dit\u00e9s des livres erron\u00e9s, des horreurs de Maurras ou de C\u00e9line ! Et que dire de ces ouvrages dans lesquels on trouve coquilles et erreurs faute d\u2019une seconde correction voire d\u2019une relecture humaine ! Et pour le dire franchement, l\u2019\u00e9diteur n\u2019est le garant d\u2019un savoir que parce que nous lui accordons toute notre confiance. Notre savoir ne repose pas sur la validation de tel ou tel, mais sur la confiance que nous lui accordons. Ainsi nous croyons dur comme fer que la racine carr\u00e9e de 2 est 1,414\u2009213\u2009562\u2009373\u2009095\u2009048\u2009801\u2009688\u2009724\u2009209\u2009698\u2009078\u2009569\u2009671\u2009875\u2009376\u2009948\u2009073\u2009176\u2009679\u2009737\u2009990\u2009732\u2009478\u2009462\u2009107\u2009038\u2009850\u2009387\u2009534\u2009327\u2009641\u2009572\u20097. Pourquoi ? Parce que la communaut\u00e9 scientifique nous l\u2019affirme. Personnellement, c\u2019est une notion que je ne suis pas capable de battre en br\u00e8che. Je m\u2019en remets donc \u00e0 un tiers, que je trouve l\u2019information dans un livre ou sur internet ne change rien. L\u2019interm\u00e9diaire entre l\u2019\u0153uvre et le lecteur n\u2019est pas souhaitable en ceci que l\u2019\u00e9dition ne comprend pas la mutation qui est en train de s\u2019accomplir, et qui, pourtant, s\u2019est d\u00e9j\u00e0 accomplie dans l\u2019industrie musicale. Condamn\u00e9s \u00e0 reproduire ce qui existe d\u00e9j\u00e0 ou \u00e0 dispara\u00eetre, les \u00e9diteurs s\u2019arc-boutent sur des principes battus en br\u00e8che par internet. Les droits d\u2019auteur et autres joyeuset\u00e9s comme les DRM font du manuel num\u00e9rique un objet peu pratique, qui ne peut s\u2019\u00e9panouir dans de telles conditions. Pire encore ces droits paralysent l\u2019essor, la diffusion, le partage du savoir. Or toute la litt\u00e9rature du Moyen \u00c2ge s\u2019est d\u00e9velopp\u00e9e hors de ce carcan que la R\u00e9volution fran\u00e7aise, soucieuse de prot\u00e9ger les auteurs, a apport\u00e9. Lib\u00e9rant l\u2019auteur du m\u00e9c\u00e9nat, il s\u2019agissait de lui donner les moyens de vivre et donc de penser. Elle ne pouvait pr\u00e9voir qu\u2019elle se ferait confisquer ses plus belles avanc\u00e9es par la rapacit\u00e9 d'auteurs et de leurs \u00e9diteurs lesquels confisqueraient \u00e0 leur seul profit des \u00e9crivains parfois morts depuis pr\u00e8s de 100 ans (ce fut le cas de Guillaume Apollinaire), quand elle ne fait pas pire\u2026 Que faire de l\u2019\u00e9diteur scolaire ? N\u2019est-il pas moribond ? Il n\u2019est plus imprimeur depuis fort longtemps (d\u00e8s le XIXe si\u00e8cle pour Louis Hachette). Certains des m\u00e9tiers li\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019impression ont disparu ou du moins partiellement disparu. C\u2019est le cas de la pr\u00e9presse, non ? Le livre devenant \u00e0 son tour immat\u00e9riel, la PAO touchant le grand public, n\u2019avons-nous pas l\u00e0 les signes d\u2019une mutation in\u00e9luctable ? Dans ces conditions, comment ne pas voir qu\u2019il p\u00e8se sur l\u2019enseignant une nouvelle responsabilit\u00e9, celle de d\u00e9terminer si telle ou telle ressource trouv\u00e9e sur internet pr\u00e9sente ou non un int\u00e9r\u00eat, si elle est fiable ou non. Si c\u2019est une responsabilit\u00e9 certaine, elle lui incombe d\u2019autant plus volontiers que du haut de ses cinq ann\u00e9es d\u2019\u00e9tudes (au minimum), l\u2019enseignant a la capacit\u00e9 de trier, de faire la part des choses dans la masse d\u2019informations que d\u00e9verse internet. Et puis on peut compter sur ce que l\u2019on appelle l\u2019intelligence collective. Wikip\u00e9dia, dont la fiabilit\u00e9 en regard de son \u00e9quivalent papier comme l\u2019Encyclopedia Britannica, n\u2019est plus \u00e0 prouver. En 2005, la revue Nature a montr\u00e9 qu\u2019on trouvait \u00e0 peu pr\u00e8s autant d\u2019erreurs dans la premi\u00e8re que dans la deuxi\u00e8me. Si un acte de vandalisme est r\u00e9alis\u00e9 en ligne, il y a de fortes chances pour que celui-ci soit corrig\u00e9. Voil\u00e0 comment le lecteur devient auteur, comment il fait autorit\u00e9. C\u2019est lui qui dira si telle ou telle ressource lui semble fiable ou pas. Ayant autorit\u00e9 sur sa mati\u00e8re, r\u00e9digeant lui-m\u00eame les manuels (en France ce sont, en effet, des enseignants qui font les manuels), ayant aujourd\u2019hui la capacit\u00e9 de s\u2019autopublier, l\u2019enseignant du XXIe si\u00e8cle est un professionnel d\u2019un nouveau genre. Au tout d\u00e9but des ann\u00e9es 1880, dans le contexte des lois Ferry, on reconnaissait aux enseignants cette capacit\u00e9 de choisir leurs propres manuels. Ce n\u2019\u00e9tait plus du ressort du minist\u00e8re. Pourquoi ne pas aller plus loin \u00e0 pr\u00e9sent puisqu\u2019il a les moyens de s\u2019autopublier ? L\u2019arr\u00eat\u00e9 du 12 mai 2010 qui explicite les comp\u00e9tences \u00e0 acqu\u00e9rir par les professeurs ne va-t-il pas dans ce sens ? Il s\u2019agit d\u2019\u00ab appr\u00e9cier la qualit\u00e9 des documents p\u00e9dagogiques (manuels scolaires num\u00e9riques ou non et livres du professeur associ\u00e9s, ressources documentaires num\u00e9riques ou non, logiciels d\u2019enseignement, etc.) \u00bb. Ainsi, le manuel sur papier, cet objet on\u00e9reux et pr\u00e9caire, en bute \u00e0 l\u2019essor d\u2019internet, conna\u00eet une v\u00e9ritable crise. Cette crise, me semble-t-il, redistribuera les r\u00f4les et modifiera notre fa\u00e7on d\u2019enseigner. Fort de tous ses avantages en termes de poids, d\u2019interactivit\u00e9 et de richesse en tout genre, plus mobile et plus personnalis\u00e9, renouant avec les aspirations p\u00e9dagogiques d\u2019un C\u00e9lestin Freinet tout en conjuguant le potentiel de la technologie, le manuel num\u00e9rique devrait prendre, \u00e0 plus ou moins longue \u00e9ch\u00e9ance place dans les cartables des \u00e9l\u00e8ves, dans les smartphones ou les tablettes. On ne fera cependant pas l\u2019\u00e9conomie d\u2019une v\u00e9ritable r\u00e9flexion sur ce que doit \u00eatre ce manuel. Devra-t-on encore parler de manuel ? N\u2019aurions-nous pas tout \u00e0 gagner \u00e0 envisager la constitution collaborative d\u2019un cahier de travaux dirig\u00e9s ? Cahier produit du travail d\u2019enseignants et de l\u2019\u00e9l\u00e8ve. Une question doit se poser \u00e9galement. Quelle entreprise emportera la mise ? Faut-il d\u2019ailleurs qu\u2019une entreprise emporte cette mise ? Google, Microsoft, Apple ont en tout cas bien compris qu\u2019il y avait l\u00e0 un march\u00e9 \u00e0 prendre. On peut regretter que l\u2019\u00e9cole soit un march\u00e9, mais c\u2019est le cas. C\u2019est d\u2019ailleurs l\u2019\u00e9dition scolaire qui, voulant \u00e9largir ce march\u00e9, l\u2019a compris fort t\u00f4t en cr\u00e9ant le cahier de vacances. En effet, en 1933, paraissait Loulou et Babette. Les r\u00e9cents partenariats avec Microsoft ou celui d\u2019Amazon avec Canop\u00e9 font ressurgir ces questions. On en est arriv\u00e9 \u00e0 un point o\u00f9 un mot, un seul, suffit \u00e0 provoquer des d\u00e9bats indign\u00e9s \u00e0 n\u2019en plus finir. Bien souvent, la l\u00e9gitimit\u00e9 de l\u2019indignation ne fait aucun doute. Mais \u00e0 voir le tout puissant SNE s\u2019exclamer ainsi, je ne peux m\u2019emp\u00eacher de l\u2019imaginer tel un petit oiseau maigrelet tremblant de toutes ses plumes sur sa petite branche secou\u00e9e par le m\u00e9chant Amazon. La petite branche a beau peser quelque 4 milliards d\u2019euros en France devant le march\u00e9 de la musique et du cin\u00e9ma, on est presque \u00e9mu pour tous ces acteurs de l\u2019\u00e9dition qui annoncent des jours terribles forc\u00e9ment ub\u00e9ris\u00e9s. D\u2019ailleurs, une fois que l\u2019adjectif est prononc\u00e9, il n\u2019y a plus qu\u2019\u00e0 acquiescer, comme si l\u2019argument devait \u00eatre forc\u00e9ment reconnu. Qui n\u2019a pas entendu parler des taxis ? Qui refuserait de voir l\u2019in\u00e9luctable \u00e9vidence ? Qui n\u2019a d\u2019ailleurs pas entendu parler du sort de l\u2019industrie de la musique ? Nicolas Demorand a eu beau le rappeler \u00e0 Antoine Gallimard au Salon du livre, rien n\u2019y fait. Il n\u2019y a pas pire sourd que celui qui ne veut pas entendre. Et de fait, on le sait d\u00e9j\u00e0. Le mod\u00e8le tel qu\u2019il existe est d\u00e9j\u00e0 compromis et tous les efforts des grandes maisons d\u2019\u00e9dition n\u2019y feront rien. Le march\u00e9 du livre num\u00e9rique l\u2019emportera. Et c\u2019est tant mieux. Il fallait r\u00e9agir avant, au lieu d\u2019\u00eatre un spectateur exasp\u00e9r\u00e9 par une \u00e9conomie en pleine mutation, et de s\u2019arc-bouter sur les principes surann\u00e9s du vieux monde. Car pendant ce temps, le vieux monde a chang\u00e9. Le livre a chang\u00e9. Profond\u00e9ment. D\u00e9sormais, exc\u00e9dant de tr\u00e8s loin le petit d\u00e9bat papier vs num\u00e9rique, le livre num\u00e9rique s\u2019inscrit dans un \u00e9cosyst\u00e8me qui rend l\u2019exp\u00e9rience de la lecture plus exaltant que jamais. Le livre num\u00e9rique donne acc\u00e8s \u00e0 une kyrielle de services dans et hors le livre. Il permet de lire ais\u00e9ment ce qui \u00e9tait auparavant complexe. Il offre des moyens in\u00e9dits de m\u00e9moriser ce qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 lu. Il se d\u00e9cline m\u00eame pour quelques sous en version papier. Mais l\u2019entreprise qui produit ce livre num\u00e9rique ne s\u2019adresse pas qu\u2019au seul lecteur. Elle s\u2019adresse \u00e0 l\u2019auteur, lui procure les moyens techniques faciles et rapides d\u2019\u00eatre publi\u00e9. Elle lui offre une visibilit\u00e9. Elle lui offre des conseils de r\u00e9daction. Et quelle entreprise permet cela ? Amazon. Doit-on signer un pacte avec le diable parce que celui-ci est s\u00e9duisant ? Mais je vous en prie. Ce d\u00e9mon n\u2019est pas tr\u00e8s contraignant. Vous ne signez pas avec votre sang, vous gardez votre \u00e2me. Vous pouvez tout autant et dans le m\u00eame temps publier chez Google, Apple, Wattpad, publie.net, YouScribe, InLibroVeritas et je ne sais plus qui encore. Vous \u00eates libre. De ce point de vue, voir le SNE s\u2019effaroucher du choix d\u2019un format propri\u00e9taire est \u00e0 se tordre de rire. Les livres publi\u00e9s par les grandes maisons d\u2019\u00e9dition (et vendus \u00e0 prix d\u2019or) sont le plus souvent bard\u00e9s de DRM qui nuisent \u00e0 leur libre circulation. Au reste, si vous \u00eates amazonis\u00e9, Calibre est votre ami. Parce que convertir un .mobi et lui supprimer les DRM que, vous qui vous auto\u00e9ditez avez le loisir de ne pas en mettre, est un jeu d\u2019enfant. Rappelons au passage que le format mobi, s\u2019il n\u2019est pas open-source, est document\u00e9 : chacun est donc libre de d\u00e9velopper son application de lecture. Ce qui explique que toutes les plateformes peuvent aujourd\u2019hui lire des livres num\u00e9riques dans ce format. Ce qui n\u2019est toujours pas le cas du ePub 3 par exemple). \u00c7a ne vous plait pas le .mobi ? Eh bien, il fallait le garder quand c\u2019\u00e9tait encore fran\u00e7ais. Et si d\u2019aventure, Amazon venait \u00e0 me d\u00e9plaire en raison d\u2019une politique que je jugerais inacceptable, je ferai comme je l\u2019ai fait pour Apple. Je claquerai la porte. L\u2019enseignant qui publie est libre. Il a juste tenu \u00e0 aller voir l\u00e0 o\u00f9 l\u2019esprit p\u00e9tille un petit peu, pour un temps donn\u00e9 peut-\u00eatre et m\u00eame il s\u2019offre le luxe de s\u2019accommoder des imp\u00e9ratifs des Communs du savoir : \u00ab Prendre au s\u00e9rieux les changements apport\u00e9s par le num\u00e9rique suppose de s\u2019int\u00e9resser \u00e0 des mutations complexes pour lesquelles on ne saurait maintenir des approches simplistes de d\u00e9fense d\u2019une profession, d\u2019un secteur, d\u2019une branche, ou encore une opposition frontale public-priv\u00e9 \u00bb Donc faire feu de tout bois, tout prendre l\u00e0 o\u00f9 l\u2019innovation est, l\u00e0 o\u00f9 on donne les moyens \u00e0 l\u2019enseignant de travailler. Pourquoi ferait-on la fine bouche ? D\u00e9sol\u00e9, je ne choisis pas Libre Office ou Microsoft. J\u2019ai besoin des deux. D\u00e9sol\u00e9, l\u2019institution ne m\u2019a pas beaucoup soutenu (et \u00e7a ne fait d\u2019ailleurs pas partie de ses projets que de soutenir la cr\u00e9ation) et pour ma part je suis all\u00e9 m\u2019\u00e9diter l\u00e0 o\u00f9 c\u2019\u00e9tait possible et je continue en exploitant applications, services, plateformes diverses et vari\u00e9es. En voici, un petit aper\u00e7u. Je n\u2019ai pas de chapelle : Pages (sur Mac), Libre Office (avec l\u2019extension eLAIX ou Writer2epub), Atlantis (sur Windows), Ulysses (sur Mac et iPad), Daedalus Touch (iOS), 1Writer (iOS), Scribus (uniquement sur Windows et Linux), Jutoh (Windows, Linux et Mac), Vellum (uniquement sur Mac), Scrivener (Windows et Mac), iBooks Author (uniquement sur Mac), Playwrite (uniquement sur Mac), Kindle Textbook Creator, Calibre, Scribaepub, ePubEditor, Audra, Aspen PictureBook, Omnibook, Book Creator, Creative Book Builder, Book Writer (uniquement sur iPad), Sigil, BlueGriffon\u2026 Et la liste s\u2019allonge quasi quotidiennement. Et qui peut bien aider les enseignants \u00e0 s\u2019y retrouver dans tout \u00e7a ? C\u2019est le R\u00e9seau Canop\u00e9. Cet op\u00e9rateur public, sous tutelle du minist\u00e8re de l\u2019\u00c9ducation nationale, mais dont tout le budget n\u2019est pas garanti par ce minist\u00e8re (20% environ sont propres au r\u00e9seau) a pour mission d\u2019accompagner les enseignants dans leur formation et dans la production de ressources p\u00e9dagogiques. Leurs Ateliers Canop\u00e9 portent bien leur nom : ce sont des espaces de conception pour les enseignants qui peuvent b\u00e9n\u00e9ficier d\u2019un accompagnement personnalis\u00e9. Un vrai luxe par les temps qui court. Luxe qui doit se financer ! C\u2019est donc dans cette double perspective qu\u2019il faut voir ce partenariat avec Amazon. Le reste suivra. Visiblement, les Editions du Net ont d\u00e9j\u00e0 approch\u00e9 Canop\u00e9 \u00e0 ce sujet. Effet positif de la concurrence, s\u2019il en est. Et le versant technique ne conna\u00eetra aucune limite : Linux, Windows, Mac OS, Android, iOS\u2026 Il n\u2019y a donc aucune inqui\u00e9tude \u00e0 avoir. Tant mieux, car c\u2019est la foire d\u2019empoigne dans un domaine o\u00f9 nos dirigeants sont capables de dire tout et son contraire : inscrivons dans la loi la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 des logiciels libres ; cr\u00e9ons un partenariat avec Microsoft\u2026 Face \u00e0 de telles incoh\u00e9rences, et compte tenu de l\u2019inexistence de moyens acad\u00e9miques permettant de faire le travail, le professeur se d\u00e9brouille seul. \u00c7a tombe bien. C\u2019est ce qu\u2019il a toujours fait. Dans les ann\u00e9es 90 avec son traitement de texte. Aujourd\u2019hui, en cr\u00e9ant son ePub, son iba, son mobi ou son PDF. Parfois en travaillant de concert avec d\u2019autres enseignants (S\u00e9samath, lelivrescolaire.fr) mais enfin il y a de la place pour de petites initiatives ponctuelles, individuelles, quasi artisanales. Et c\u2019est l\u00e0 que l\u2019auto\u00e9dition prend tout son sens. En dehors de toute politique. C\u2019est comme \u00e7a depuis le d\u00e9but. En somme, l\u2019enseignant avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 un peu ub\u00e9ris\u00e9 par l\u2019institution elle-m\u00eame, qui le laisse se d\u00e9brouiller. La porte \u00e9tait ouverte. Amazon y est entr\u00e9e.","title":"Transformer l\u2019\u00e9cole"},{"location":"%C3%89criture/Un%20Centaure%20%C3%A0%20l%27%C3%A9cole/Un%20Centaure%20%C3%A0%20l%27%C3%A9cole%20TOC/","text":"Avant-propos 1999 Points d\u2019achoppement Le num\u00e9rique en 2016 Les centaures 10 objectifs de l\u2019\u00e9cole num\u00e9rique Le code et autres modes Transformer l\u2019\u00e9cole La panac\u00e9e Paradigme de l'enseignant GitHub \u29eb Avant-propos 1999 Points d\u2019achoppement Le num\u00e9rique en 2016 Les centaures 10 objectifs de l\u2019\u00e9cole num\u00e9rique Le code et autres modes Transformer l\u2019\u00e9cole La panac\u00e9e Paradigme de l\u2019enseignant Liens HackMD \u29eb Un Centaure \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9cole (premi\u00e8re partie) Un Centaure \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9cole (deuxi\u00e8me partie) Un Centaure \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9cole (troisi\u00e8me partie)","title":"Un Centaure \u00e0 l'\u00e9cole TOC"},{"location":"%C3%89criture/Un%20Centaure%20%C3%A0%20l%27%C3%A9cole/Un%20Centaure%20%C3%A0%20l%27%C3%A9cole%20TOC/#github","text":"Avant-propos 1999 Points d\u2019achoppement Le num\u00e9rique en 2016 Les centaures 10 objectifs de l\u2019\u00e9cole num\u00e9rique Le code et autres modes Transformer l\u2019\u00e9cole La panac\u00e9e Paradigme de l\u2019enseignant Liens","title":"GitHub"},{"location":"%C3%89criture/Un%20Centaure%20%C3%A0%20l%27%C3%A9cole/Un%20Centaure%20%C3%A0%20l%27%C3%A9cole%20TOC/#hackmd","text":"Un Centaure \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9cole (premi\u00e8re partie) Un Centaure \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9cole (deuxi\u00e8me partie) Un Centaure \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9cole (troisi\u00e8me partie)","title":"HackMD"}]}
